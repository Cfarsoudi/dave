	FADE IN:



	CLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN



	A card: Chicago.



	He's in his thirties.  His neck is pinched into a crisp 

	dress shirt and tie.  His expression is vacant, faraway.

	A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the 

	distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.



				 SAM

		   Mommy got sick and it happened 

		   just like that and there was 

		   nothing anybody would do.

			   (continued)



	And pull back to reveal:



	EXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY



	Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on 

	his shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a 

	turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --



				 SAM

		    If we start asking why we'll go 

		    crazy.  So, rule number one.  

		    We don't ask why.



							CUT TO:



	CLOSE ON ANNIE REED



	Pretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore 

	Orioles hat.



				 ANNIE

		    Why? I just want to know why? 

		    That's my first rule.  I always 

		    ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.  

		    C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --



	And pull back to reveal:



	EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY



	Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy 

	named SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the 

	house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.  

	The same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up 

	the back wooden staircase to the house.



				 SETH

		    There's no why, Annie.  I'm 

		    just not up for it.  I never 

		    said I was.



				 ANNIE

		    Is there somebody else?



				 SETH

		    Nope.



				 ANNIE

		    You don't love me, is that it?



				 SETH

		    Nope.



	Follow them into:



	INT. KITCHEN - DUSK



	As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to 

	assemble them.



				 ANNIE

		    How about ... you're too 

		    narcissistic to commit to 

		    another human being in a long-

		    term way.



				 SETH

			   (agreeably)

		    That's good.



							CUT TO:



	INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY



	An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are 

	stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a 

	months.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly 

	in the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window 

	that looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of 

	flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.



				 SUZY

		    Five minutes in the microwave.  

		    Any one of them, five minutes 

		    and done.  Ready to eat.  Do 

		    you know how to make juice?



				 SAM

		    Microwave.  Five minutes.



							CUT TO:



	ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER



	Packing boxes.  Seth is moving out.



				 ANNIE

		    You take the microwave?



				 SETH

		    What am I going to do with a 

		    microwave?



				 ANNIE

		    You turn it on, you open it and 

		    you stand in front of it for a 

		    very long time.



				 SETH

		    So you're angry.  Big deal.



							CUT TO:



	SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



	A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

	rise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with 

	several architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at 

	his desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over 

	to him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind 

	but a little stuffy.



				 ROB

		    Young man, it's none of my 

		    business, but maybe you should 

		    talk to someone.  I myself 

		    have consulted a professional.  

		    I used to be up tight.



	On Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more 

	uptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out 

	of his shirt pocket and reads them off.



				 SAM

		    Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...

		    Loss of Spouse support groups...

		    Single parent discussion nights...

		    Parents without partners.

			   (starts riffling, angry)

		    Partners without parents.  

		    People who need people.  Guys 

		    who go into the woods, beat 

		    drums and bond.  Get a shrink.  

		    Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.



	He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring 

	at him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying 

	attention.  Someone whispers something to a client.



				 SAM

			   (continued)

		    Don't mind him.  He's the guy 

		    who just lost his wife.

			   (beat)

		    What I really think is we need 

		    a change.



				 ROB

		    Good idea.  Take a few weeks 

		    off, get some sun, take Jonah 

		    fishing --



				 SAM

			   (shaking his head no)

		    A real change.  New city.  

		    Someplace where every time I go 

		    around a corner I don't think 

		    of Maggie.



	And hold on Sam for a moment and--



							DISSOLVE:



	EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - DAY



	Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.  It's a 

	gorgeous day for a game.  They high-five each other.



				 ROB (V.O.)

		    Where you going to go?



	And cut back to:



	INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



	As Sam snaps out of it.



				 SAM

		    I was thinking about Seattle.



	INT. CHICAGO TRIBUNE - DAY



	The Living Section of the paper.  Annie is blowing her 

	nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her 

	boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.



				 LAURIE

		    Honey, he wasn't right for you.



				 ANNIE

			   (blowing her nose)

		    I know.



				 LAURIE

		    He wasn't even wrong for you, 

		    like cosmically wrong, so don't 

		    beat up on yourself for 

		    wasting...however long it was.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.

			   (blowing her nose 

			    again)



	She pours Annie a cup of hot water.  Annie pulls a 

	teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.



				 LAURIE

		    Maybe you should see a shrink.



			         ANNIE

		    I want my money.



				 LAURIE

		    Go home for the weekend.



				 ANNIE

			   (after a beat)

		    That's what I'm going to do.  

		    I'm going to go home.

			   (she thinks about it)

		    I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm 

		    going back to Baltimore.

			   (she's giddy)

		    How does a blonde do a high-

		    five?



	She smacks herself in the head.



							CUT TO:



	O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY



	The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L.  Coming 

	down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son 

	MACK, and several other friends.



	And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a 

	couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.



	They pass each other going in diagonal directions and 

	continue on.



	We stay with Sam's group:



				 JONAH

			   (to Mack)

		    Dad says I'm going to get used 

		    to it, but I don't think you 

		    can ever get used to a 

		    designated hitter.



	overlap:



				 SUZY

			   (to Sam)

		    Eventually, in a few months, 

		    you'll start seeing women, 

		    you'll meet someone.



				 SAM

		    Move on.  Right.  That's what 

		    I'm going to do.  In a few 

		    months, boom, I'll be fine, 

		    I'll just grow a new heart.



				 SUZY

		    I'm sorry --



				 GREG

		    Sam, she didn't mean --



	Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for 

	the Seattle plane.



				 SAM

		    I know, I know.

			   (emphatic)

		    Look, it doesn't happen twice.



							CUT TO:



	Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the 

	Baltimore plane.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm going to meet someone, 

		    someone nice and stable who 

		    wears a hat so he won't catch a 

		    cold, and I'm going to marry 

		    him and have three children 

		    and live happily ever after.  

		    I mean, I am not cut out for this 

		    --


				 DIANE

		    For what?



				 ANNIE

		    For life as we know it.



				 LAURIE

		    Just make sure he isn't fat 

		    like my Michael or you'll spend 

		    your whole life worrying he's 

		    going to drop dead.



				 JUDITH

		    God, you guys are so romantic.



				 ANNIE

		    Do you know how long romance 

		    lasts?

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    That long.



				 DIANE

		    Steven still brings me flowers 

		    every Friday and we've been 

		    married 10 years.



				 LAURIE

			   (to Diane)

		    Honey, nobody wants to hear 

		    that.

			   (to Annie)

		    Here, darling, have some Tic 

		    Tacs.



	Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded 

	with stuff.



				 ANNIE

		    The next time you see me I am 

		    going to be incredibly happy.



	INT. PLANE - NIGHT



	Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the 

	runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches 

	over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus.



				 SAM

		    I'm your dad.  Don't ever 

		    forget that.  That's rule 

		    number two.

			   (beat)

		    It's you and me, kid.



	INT. PLANE - NIGHT



	Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the 

	runway.



				 ANNIE

			   (to herself)

		    I guess it's just us.



	She gulps.



	EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT



	The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for 

	instructions.



	And now they both start to take off.  In opposite 

	directions.



	And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, 

	one flying east, the other flying west.



	And further and further back as they soar into the air 

	and leave the frame.



	The night sky.



	Stars twinkle.



	And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks 

	like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by 

	Saul Steinberg.



	A light goes on in Baltimore.



	A light goes on in Seattle.



	They are the only lights on the map.



	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE



	As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER 

	JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're 

	carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're 

	walking toward the parking lot.



				 WALTER

		    The short one with black hair 

		    is your cousin Irene --



				 ANNIE

		    -- who's married to --



				 WALTER

		    Harold, who ran away with his 

		    secretary but came back --



				 ANNIE

		    -- because Irene threatened to 

		    put the dog to sleep if he 

		    didn't --



				 WALTER

		    And your brother Tom is a 

		    psychology professor and is 

		    married to...Betsy --



				 ANNIE

		    -- who is the most competitive 

		    woman in the world --



	They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and 

	pull out together.



	EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT



	Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in 

	front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park 

	their cars.  They get out assembling presents.



				 WALTER

		    Your Uncle Milton lost all his 

		    money in a Puerto Rican 

		    condominium that went belly up, 

		    don't mention the IRS or the 

		    Federal prison system.  Your 

		    mother is Barbara, your father 

		    is Cliff --



				 ANNIE

		    I hope he doesn't get out his 

		    slides.



				 WALTER

		    Am I what they had in mind?



				 ANNIE

		    They're going to love you.



	As they start toward the house.



							CUT TO:



	CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.



	AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



	INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT



				 BARBARA

		    Everybody! Annie has an announcement --



				 ANNIE

		    Walter and I are engaged!



	And the family's at the diner table.  Annie's family is 

	a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only 

	everyone is a little eccentric.  Annie's mother BARBARA, 

	a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, 

	claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at 

	the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.  

	Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table, 

	along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE 

	MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.  

	There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.



				 IRENE

		    That's wonderful, Annie.  I 

		    hope it lasts... for years 

		    and years.



				 BETSY

			   (the competitive one)

		    Do you have a ring?



				 ANNIE

		    No.  Not yet.



				 BETSY

		    Oh.  Well.  How will anyone 

		    know?



				 TOM

		    Because you're going to call 

		    them all and tell them.  

		    Congratulations, Walter.



	He claps Walter on the back.



	Walter sneezes.  And sneezes again.



				 CLIFF

		    Are you all right?



				 WALTER

		    It's nothing.  Nothing.



				 ANNIE

		    It's probably just the flowers --



				 BARBARA

		    We'll move them --



				 WALTER

		    Don't touch them.  I feel 

		    terrible sneezing at a time 

		    like this.  This is a big 

		    moment for me --



				 ANNIE

			   (overlapping)

		    He's allergic to everything, 

		    don't worry about it --



				 HAROLD

		    Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.



				 CLIFF

		    Not salmon I hope --



				 ANNIE

		    If he eats one tiny piece of a 

		    nut --



				 WALTER

			   (cheerfully)

		    My head swells up like a 

		    watermelon and I drop dead.



				 IRENE

		    It's the same with Harold and 

		    bees.



				 CLIFF

		    Your mother and I had salmon at 

		    our wedding, and I really think 

		    a wedding without cold salmon --



				 WALTER

		    I'm not allergic to salmon.  I 

		    don't think.  But you never 

		    know.



				 HAROLD

		    You never know.



				 BARBARA

		    Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we 

		    used up this magnum of 

		    champagne we were saving on 

		    something else, what did we use 

		    it for?



				 TOM

		    Uncle Milton's parole --



				 BARBARA

		    Right.



				 UNCLE MILTON

		    And it was delicious.



				 BARBARA

		    It was, wasn't it, Milton 

		    darling --



				 BETSY

		    When are you getting married, 

		    Annie?



				 CLIFF

		    In early June.  In the garden.



				 HAROLD

		    Does it have to be in the garden?



				 IRENE

		    What about Harold and bees?



				 BARBARA

		    We'll spray you.



				 CLIFF

		    Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber 

		    salad.  Strawberries.



				 WALTER

		    I'm afraid I'm allergic to 

		    strawberries.



				 CLIFF

		    No strawberries.



	Annie smiles at Walter.



				 ANNIE

			   (to Walter)

		    Is that all right with you?



				 WALTER

			   (to Lou Gehrig line)

		    Today I consider myself the 

		    luckiest man on the face of 

		    the earth.



				 IRENE

		    What are you wearing?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know.



				 BETSY

		    I wish you would wear my dress.  

		    I only wore it once, and you'll 

		    barely have to do anything to 

		    it except take it in in the 

		    bust --



				 BARBARA

		    I have something that might do 

		    --



	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER



	Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides 

	of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room 

	Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas 

	carols.



	INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS



	MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to 

	burp.



	INT. ATTIC - NIGHT



	The sound of Christmas carols from below.



	The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with 

	her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a 

	sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful 

	antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy.



				 BARBARA

		    The Historical Society wanted 

		    this and I never would give it 

		    to them --



				 ANNIE

		    Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.



				 BARBARA

		    I notice these things are back 

		    in fashion.  Oh, honey.

			   (tears are rolling down 

			    her face as she tries 

			    the veil on Annie)

		    He's a lovely man, Annie.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.  He's wonderful, isn't 

		    he?



				 BARBARA

		    Are his folks nice?



				 ANNIE

		    You'll love them.  We're going 

		    down to D.C.  tonight to be with 

		    them Christmas morning.



				 BARBARA

		    How did it happen?



	Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back 

	of the dress and remove it from the dummy.



				 ANNIE

		    It's silly, really.  I mean, 

		    I'd seen him at the office, 

		    obviously I'd seen him, he's 

		    the associate publisher, and 

		    then one day we both ordered 

		    sandwiches from the same place, 

		    and he got my lettuce and 

		    tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 

		    which of course he was allergic 

		    to, and I got his lettuce and 

		    tomato on white.



				 BARBARA

			   (utterly without irony)

		    How amazing.



				 ANNIE

		    It is, isn't it? You make 

		    millions of decisions that mean 

		    nothing and then one day you 

		    decide to order takeout and it 

		    changes your life.



				 BARBARA

		    Destiny takes a hand.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, please.  Destiny's just 

		    something we've invented 

		    because we can't stand the fact 

		    that everything that happens is 

		    accidental.



				 BARBARA

		    Then how do you explain that 

		    you both ordered exactly the 

		    same sandwich except for the 

		    bread? How many people in this 

		    world like lettuce and tomato 

		    without something else like 

		    tuna?



				 ANNIE

		    It wasn't a sign.  It was a 

		    coincidence.



	Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie 

	steps into it.



	Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.



				 BARBARA

		    I was in Atlantic City with my 

		    family.  Cliff was a waiter.  

		    He talked me into sneaking out 

		    for a midnight walk on the 

		    Steel Pier.  I've probably told 

		    you this a million times, but 

		    I don't care.  And then he held 

		    my hand.  I was scared.  All 

		    sorts of thing were going 

		    through my head.  But after a 

		    while I forgot about them.  At 

		    one point I looked down, at our 

		    hands, and I couldn't tell 

		    which fingers were mine and 

		    which were his.  And I knew.



				 ANNIE

			   (hearing it for the 

			    first time)

		    What?



				 BARBARA

		    You know.



				 ANNIE

			   (she doesn't know, but 

			    she doesn't want her 

			    mother to know she 

			    doesn't know)

		    What?



				 BARBARA

		    Magic.  It was magic.



				 ANNIE

			   (repeating)

		    Magic.



				 BARBARA

		    I knew we would be together 

		    forever, and that everything 

		    would be wonderful, just the 

		    way you feel about Walter.  

		    Walter.  It's quite a formal 

		    name, isn't it?

			   (lowering her voice)

		    One of the things I truly knew 

		    was that your father and I were 

		    going to have a wonderful time

		    ... in the sack I believe you 

		    call it --



				 ANNIE

		    Mom!



				 BARBARA

		    Of course it took several years 

		    before everything worked like 

		    clockwork in that department, 

		    so don't be worried if it takes 

		    a while --



				 ANNIE

		    Mom, we already...



				 BARBARA

		    Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da 

		    dee.  And how's it working?



				 ANNIE

		    Like... clockwork.



	She turns to look in the mirror.  The dress doesn't fit 

	at all.  It's completely lopsided.  One shoulder is 

	higher than the other.  The waist is in the wrong spot.  

	The effect is quite comical.



				 BARBARA

		    So you'll get married in a new 

		    dress.



				 ANNIE

		    It's a sign.



				 BARBARA

			   (gently)

		    You don't believe in signs.



	EXT. STREET - LATE



	The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on 

	the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.



				 ANNIE

		    They loved you.  I told you 

		    they would love you and they 

		    did.



				 WALTER

		    I love you.



				 ANNIE

		    I love you, Walter.

			   (beat)

		    Did anyone ever call you 

		    anything other than Walter?



				 WALTER

		    Nope.



				 ANNIE

		    Even when you were young?



				 WALTER

		    Nope.  Not even when I was 

		    young.



	It's starting to rain.



				 WALTER

		    You sure you don't want to 

		    drive with me?



				 ANNIE

		    How will I get back to 

		    Baltimore Saturday?

			   (remembering something)

		    Oh God, I forgot my present for 

		    your stepmother -- I took it 

		    inside by accident.



				 WALTER

		    I'll wait.



				 ANNIE

		    Don't be silly.  I'll just be 

		    ten minutes behind you.



	EXT. BELTWAY - NIGHT



	As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.



	Raining.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



	Annie driving.  Presents on the front seat.  She's 

	singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects 

	and clipclops and giddyups.  After a moment, she 

	realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the 

	radio.



				 DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE

		    Welcome back to "You and Your 

		    Emotions." I'm Dr.  Marcia 

		    Fieldstone broadcasting across 

		    America from the top of the 

		    Sears Tower in Chicago where we 

		    would have a fantastic view of 

		    Santa Claus and his reindeer if 

		    there was a -- oops, never 

		    mind.  Tonight we're talking 

		    about wishes and dreams.  

		    What's your wishes this Christmas 

		    Eve? Maybe the best present 

		    you can give yourself is a call 

		    to me.  The number is --



				 ANNIE

		    Give me a break.



	Annie changes the station.



				 RADIO VOICE

		    The subject of the evening's 

		    medical update is You and Your 

		    Spleen and our host --



	She flips the dial back the other way.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Our caller is from Seattle.



	Annie changes the station.



				 RADIO VOICE

		    Coming up, Jingle Bells 

		    backwards, sung by the New 

		    Jersey Cape Mayettes --



	Annie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a 

	YOUNG BOY's voice.



				 BOY'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    Hello, this is Jonah --

			   (there's a bleep as 

			    Jonah says his last 

			    name)



	Annie's hand lingers on the dial.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    No last names, Jonah.  Hello 

		    there, you sound younger than 

		    our usual callers.  How come 

		    you're up so late?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's not that late in Seattle.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Got me there.  What's your 

		    Christmas wish, Jonah?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's not for me.  It's for my 

		    dad.  I think he needs a new 

		    wife.



	Annie shakes her head.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    You don't like the one he was 

		    now?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    He doesn't have one now.  

		    That's the problem.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Where's your mom?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    She died.



	Annie closes her eyes for a moment.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't believe this --



	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



	As the car drives along.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I've been pretty sad, but I 

		    think my dad is worse.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    And you're worried about him.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I'm worried about him, he's 

		    worried about me, I ride my 

		    bike to school, he follows in 

		    the car, like I'm not supposed 

		    to know he's there.  Now it's 

		    Christmas, and you know what 

		    happens to people at Christmas.



				 ANNIE

		    They lose their minds and call 

		    crackpot doctors on the radio --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Have you talked to your dad 

		    about this?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    No.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's very hard for him to talk 

		    about this stuff.  It's like it 

		    makes him sadder.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    You want me to talk to him?



				 ANNIE

		    Perfect.  Sandbag the father.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    And you crazy? He thinks shows 

		    like this are dumb.  If you 

		    didn't have an 800 number I 

		    could never get away with this 

		    --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Is he home right now?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Yeah.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Well, I think I can help a 

		    little more if I talk to him 

		    directly.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I don't know --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm sure he won't be angry once 

		    he realizes how concerned you 

		    are about him.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Okay, but if I get yelled at, 

		    I'm never gonna listen to this 

		    show again.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Fair enough.



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the 

	houseboat he lives in with Sam.  He's got the phone cord 

	coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's 

	standing near the kitchen end of a large living area 

	looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting 

	in a deck chair looking out at the sea.



				 JONAH

		    Dad --



				 SAM

		    What is it?



	ON ANNIE AGAIN.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    There's somebody on the phone 

		    for you.

			   (into phone)

		    His name is Sam.



				 ANNIE

		    This is completely disgusting.



	INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam pokes his head in the back door.  He looks much as 

	he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is 

	a little longer.  He picks up the phone extension.



				 SAM

		    Hello.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone on Network America.



	Sam looks across the room to Jonah.



				 SAM

		    I'm probably not interested in 

		    whatever you're selling.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm not selling anything.  Your 

		    son called and asked for advice 

		    on how to find you a new wife.



				 SAM

			   (he really didn't get 

			    her name)

		    Who is this?



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

			   (repeating herself)

		    Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of 

		    Network America.



				 SAM

		    Jesus, are we on the air? 

		    Jonah, for God's sake --



				 JONAH

		    Don't be mad at me, Dad.



	Sam can see Jonah.  He's frightened.  Sam immediately 

	feels how upset Jonah is.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    He feels that since your wife's 

		    death you've been very unhappy. 

		    He's genuinely worried about you.



	Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's 

	standing on.



				 SAM

			   (to Jonah)

		    I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm 

		    not mad at you.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I think it's hard for him to 

		    talk to you about all this.  

		    Maybe we could talk and it 

		    would make him feel a little 

		    better.



	Sam hesitates.



				 JONAH

		    Please --



	INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT



				 ANNIE

		    This is a grotesque violation 

		    of this man's personal life, 

		    but never mind --



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    All righ...



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Good.  How long ago did your 

		    wife die?



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



				 SAM

		    It's been about a year and a 

		    half.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Have you had any relationship 

		    since?



				 SAM

		    No.



	Sam is very uncomfortable about this --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM

		    Look, Doctor, I don't want to 

		    be rude, but --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    And I don't want to invade your 

		    privacy --



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



				 ANNIE

		    Sure you do.



				 SAM (V.O.)

			   (overlapping)

		    Sure you do --



	Annie smiles.



				 SAM

		    Look, we had a tough time at 

		    first, but I think I'm holding 

		    my own as a dad, and Jonah and 

		    I will get along fine again as 

		    soon as I break his radio.



	Annie laughs.  So does Mr.  Fieldstone



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is smiling too.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I have no doubt that you're a 

		    good dad.  You can tell a lot 

		    from a person's voice.  But 

		    something must be missing if 

		    Jonah feels that you're still 

		    under a cloud.



				 JONAH

		    Tell her how you don't sleep at 

		    night.



				 SAM

		    How do you know that?



	Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally 

	talking to each other on the phone within their own 

	house, but also ON THE AIR.



				 JONAH

		    I can hear you walking around 

		    sometimes.  At first I thought 

		    it was a robber.  Go ahead, 

		    tell her, Dad.



				 SAM

		    I don't think I have to now.



	Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts 

	toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.  

	On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.



				 SAM

		    Look, it's almost Christmas --

			   (as the two of them sit 

			    down together on the 

			    bench)

		    A kid needs a mother --



	He puts an arm around Jonah.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



	As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Could it be that you need 

		    someone just as much as Jonah 

		    does?



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.



	Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm losing my mind.



	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



	As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    We've been talking to -- well, 

		    let's just call him Sleepless 

		    in Seattle, and we'll be right 

		    back after this break with 

		    listener response, your 

		    response, to the things we've 

		    been discussing.  The number to 

		    call is...



	INT. BALDWIN HOUSE



				 SAM

		    What's she talking about?



				 JONAH

		    This is where other people get 

		    to call in and dump on what you 

		    said.



	We hear the beginning of a commercial.



	INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT



	Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio 

	reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee.  

	There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS 

	LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a 

	TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, 

	is visible through an open window to the kitchen.



				 LORETTA

		    I'll bet he's tall, with a cute 

		    butt.



				 HARRIET

		    I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a 

		    week.  I'll bet he stinks.



				 LORETTA

		    Shut up, Harriet.

			   (to Annie)

		    What'll it be?



				 ANNIE

		    Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.



				 LORETTA

		    Maybe I should hustle myself 

		    out to Seattle.  Give him a 

		    little present for New Year's 

		    Eve.



				 HARRIET

		    You can go there if you want 

		    but don't open his refrigerator.  

		    They don't cover anything when 

		    they put it in the fridge.  

		    They just stick it in and leave 

		    it there till it walks out by 

		    itself.



				 LORETTA

		    Harriet, ever since you 

		    divorced your last husband, 

		    you've been no fun.  I'm 

		    looking, and this guy pops my 

		    tarts.



				 TRUCK DRIVER

		    Come on, Loretta, you're going 

		    to have to jump-start this guy.  

		    His battery's dead.  And look 

		    at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.  

		    Every six minutes, another 

		    charge.



				 LORETTA

		    I'm looking for someone 

		    sensitive.



				 ANNIE

		    Come on, nobody wants a guy 

		    who's sensitive on the radio.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Let's take a call before we get 

		    back to Sleepless.  Knoxville, 

		    Tennessee, you're on.



				 SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE

		    Yes, I would just like to know 

		    where I could get this man's 

		    address?



				 LORETTA

			   (to the radio)

		    Honey, get on line.



	EXT. DINER - NIGHT



	As Annie gets into her car.



	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C.  STREET - NIGHT



	Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents 

	live.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Do you think there's somebody 

		    out there you could love as 

		    much as your wife? Maybe even 

		    more?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    It's hard to imagine.



	And cut back and forth between the car and the 

	houseboat.  Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but 

	Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.  Sam is stroking 

	the boy's hair.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What are you going to do, Sam?



				 SAM

		    I don't know.  When I met my 

		    wife, it was so clear.  I just 

		    knew.



	Annie is listening now.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What was it that made you know?



				    SAM

		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM

		    And if I could describe it, 

		    it probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.

			   (continued)



	Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in 

	Washington, D.C., the motor running.  She's hooked now, 

	she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it 

	all.



				 SAM

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like...



				 ANNIE

		    Magic.



				 SAM

		    Magic.



	CLOSER ON ANNIE



	realizing she has just said this.  Realizing that it 

	must mean something but not knowing what.



	SHE'S CRYING.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Well, it's time to wrap up, 

		    folks --



	A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which 

	Annie doesn't notice.  She's wiping the tears away with 

	her hand.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    We hope you'll call again soon.



	The figure TAPS on the window --



				 WALTER

			   (muffled, outside car)

		    Annie?



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

	    	    ... and let us know how it's 

	    	    going.



	-- and taps again.



				 WALTER

		    Annie?



	She turns.  He's pointing at the locked door.  She 

	searches for the button.  Finally finds it so that 

	Walter can open the door.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm sorry, Walter.  I just 

		    heard the most amazing thing on 

		    the radio.



	They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie 

	carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.



				 ANNIE

		    People call up these shows and 

		    you can't believe the stuff 

		    they say.  It's the end of 

		    privacy as we know it, this 

		    country is just one big global 

		    village with everyone out there 

		    going blah blah blah --



	As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see 

	a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.



							CUT TO:



	A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS



	as we pull back to reveal:



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING



	As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut 

	from gift to gift:



	A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and 

	which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing 

	to open:



	A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his 

	neck.



	A PLAID SHIRT



	A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in 

	schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller.



	And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind 

	the door and Jonah opens --



	A NEW FISHING ROD



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



	As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his 

	tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new 

	plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam 

	takes his picture.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT)



	Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he 

	made in woodworking class.



				 SAM

		    The hopes are perfect -- 

		    beautiful, identical, smooth -- 

		    and they are for something 

		    really amazing I feel it in my 

		    bones --



				 JONAH

		    It's a spice rack.



				 SAM

		    We desperately need a spice 

		    rack.  Desperately.



							CUT TO:



	INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY



				 SAM

		    And we desperately need spices.



	Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, 

	salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which 

	has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is 

	methodically making pancakes.



				 JONAH

		    Dad?  About last night?



				 SAM

		    It's never happening again.  

		    Right?



				 JONAH

		    Right.



	There's a knock on the door.



				 SAM

		    Then it never happened.



	Sam goes to answer the door.



	TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing 

	quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It 

	says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH.



				 SAM

		    Hi.



				 LULU

		    Hi.  Sam?



				 SAM

		    Yes?



				 LULU

			   (looking in and seeing 

			       Jonah)

		    You must be Jonah.



	Jonah nods.



				 LULU

			   (to her friend)

		    See.  I told you.  Sam and 

		    Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is 

		    JoBeth.



	JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.



				 LULU

			   (continues)

		    We live two piers over, don't 

		    we? Number 12, right? We're 

		    having like a really neat open 

		    house today from like four to 

		    whenever if you care to stop 

		    by.



				 SAM

		    Thanks, but... we've got plans.



				 LULU

		    Well, here's the number.  If 

		    you ever find yourself 

		    Sleepless, give us a call.  We 

		    also... do babysitting.



	She winks.  JoBeth nods.



	Sam nods.



	Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down 

	the dock.



	Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.



				 JONAH

		    Not.



				 SAM

		    My feelings exactly.



	EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING



	Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.



				 SAM

		    How many people do you think 

		    heard that thing last night?



				 JONAH

		    It plays in 50 states.



				 SAM

		    What?!



				 JONAH

		    Nobody else is going to know it 

		    was us.



				 SAM

		    You're right.

			   (after a beat)

		    You better hope so.



	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING



	INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY



	A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at 

	computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned 

	offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is 

	BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a 

	table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and 

	two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is 

	playing Gameboy.



				 KEITH

		    This man sells the greatest 

		    soup you've ever eaten, there's 

		    a line around the block, and he 

		    is, I am not kidding, the meanest 

		    man in America.

			   (beat)

		    I feel strongly about this, 

		    Becky.  This is not just about 

		    soup.



				 BECKY

		    Do it.  What else?



				 WYATT

		    New Year's Eve.  Please don't 

		    make me write it.



	Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.



				 BECKY

		    Wyatt, I do not mean to remind 

		    you of your mother, but if you 

		    don't put that game away, no TV 

		    for a week.



				 WYATT

			   (pushing it to the 

			    center of the table)

		    Would someone look this up, 

		    don't tell me where.



	Becky is riffling through some papers on the table, 

	among which are some tearsheets from the Associated 

	Press wire.



				 BECKY

		    Listen to this.  Phone service 

		    in the greater Chicago area was 

		    tied up for two hours Christmas 

		    Eve because some kid called a 

		    phone-in show to get a wife for 

		    his father.  Two thousand women 

		    called in for the number.



				 KEITH

		    Jesus.



				 ANNIE

		    I heard it.  This kid calls up 

		    and says my dad needs a wife 

		    and I'm talking to myself in 

		    the car saying, this is 

		    completely disgusting, you're 

		    taking advantage of a child, 

		    and then the father gets on and 

		    this shrinkette says, do you 

		    want to talk about it? And he 

		    says no as a matter of fact I 

		    don't, and I am saying, bravo! 

		    Right on! Don't talk to her, 

		    it's none of her business --

			   (she's completely into 

			    this story now)

		    -- and then suddenly, for no 

		    reason at all, he's talking 

		    about how much he loved his 

		    wife, and how he just --

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    fell in love with her and I am 

		    crying.  Me.  A tear is 

		    actually rolling down my face.  

		    It was like what happens when I 

		    watch those phone company ads.  

		    I don't have to see the whole 

		    ad, I just have to see the part 

		    where the daughter gives her 

		    mother a refrigerator with a 

		    big red bow on it, have you 

		    seen that one?



	Everyone looks at her.  Apparently she's finished.



				 BECKY

		    You should write something 

		    about this.



				 ANNIE

		    About what?



				 BECKY

		    Whatever it is.



				 KEITH

			   (waving the AP story)

		    What it is is, there are a lot 

		    of desperate women out there 

		    looking for love.



				 WYATT

		    Especially over a certain age.



	Annie is looking at them.  This isn't what she was 

	talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what 

	she was talking about.



				 KEITH

		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist after the age of 40 

		    than it is to get married --



				 ANNIE

		    That is not true.  That 

		    statistic is not true.



				 BECKY

		    It's not true, but it feels 

		    true.



				 ANNIE

		    There's practically a whole 

		    book about how that statistic 

		    is not true --



				 WYATT

		    Calm down.  You brought it up --



				 ANNIE

			   (sharply)

		    I did not, Wyatt.



	A beat, everyone pauses.  Things are a little out of 

	hand.



				 BECKY

		    So where were we?



				 WYATT

		    New Year's Eve.  I'll do it, 

		    okay?



				 BECKY

		    Okay.



				 ANNIE

		    If someone is a widower, why do 

		    they say he was widowed? Why 

		    don't they say he was widowered?



	Everyone looks at her strangely.



				 ANNIE

		    I was jus wondering.



	EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY



	Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying 

	to catch up.



				 BECKY

		    What was that about up there?



				 ANNIE

		    What was what?



				 BECKY

		    What's with you?



				 ANNIE

		    Nothing's with me.



	INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY



	Becky and Annie are having lunch.



				 BECKY

		    "Sleepless in Seattle"?



				 ANNIE

		    That's what she called him on 

		    the show.  Because he can't 

		    sleep.



				 BECKY

		    And now 2,000 women want his 

		    number.  The guy could be a 

		    crackhead, a psychopath, a 

		    flasher, a junkie, a 

		    transvestite, a chain-saw 

		    murderer, or someone really 

		    sick, like Rick.



				 ANNIE

		    Actually, he sounded nice.



				 BECKY

		    Oh? Oh, really? Now we're 

		    getting down to it.



				 ANNIE

		    Not.



	She reaches down for her purse.



	INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY



	A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle 

	newspaper, and



	PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



	Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old 

	house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing 

	Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active 

	everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being 

	installed, tile being set.



	One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him, 

	and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for 

	them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older, 

	always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and 

	always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.



				 BOB LANGMAN

		    Now she wants a circular 

		    stairwell off the den.



				 JAY

			   (to Jonah, in b.g.)

		    Punch me, punch in right here.

			   (points to his stomach;

			    Jonah punches)

		    And she wants the Sub-Zero with 

		    the side-by-side doors --



				 BOB

		    Which means --



				 SAM

		    The cabinets have to be redone 

		    --



	They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a 

	nightmare.



				 BOB

		    So we thought --



				 JAY

		    Since you're on the make again 

		    --



	Sam looks at Jonah --



				 SAM

		    Great.  This is great.  The 

		    whole town knows.  Just out of 

		    curiosity, how do you two know?



				 BOB

		    Grace heard it.



				 SAM

		    Grace the dispatcher.  Great.



				 BOB

		    The point is, take the client 

		    out to dinner and ask her to 

		    marry you and then maybe we 

		    won't have to redo the kitchen 

		    cabinets.



				 SAM

		    Why me? What about Jay?



				 JAY

		    Hey, my plate is full.



				 SAM

		    Well, okay.  What's the big 

		    deal?  If she'll forget the 

		    new fireplace, I'll marry her.  

		    Just point me in the right 

		    direction.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, I don't know about this 

		    one --



				 SAM

		    Oh, you're changing your mind 

		    --



				 JONAH

		    No, I'm not, but --



				 SAM

		    What's the matter with this 

		    one? Wouldn't you like to have 

		    Imelda Marcos as your mother?



				 JONAH

		    Dad --



	Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.



				 SAM

		    We better take the measurements 

		    for the new cabinets.



	He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and 

	starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in 

	another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay 

	tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into 

	the wall.



				 BOB

		    Sam, if you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- 

		    obviously you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- we're 

		    having some people over, all of 

		    them married, not one even 

		    remotely interested in playing 

		    around.  Does that sound great 

		    or what?

			   (whistfully)

		    I can't think of the last time 

		    I was at a party when anything 

		    actually happened.



				 SAM

		    Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's 

		    kind of a big night.  I don't 

		    like to leave Jonah alone.



							CUT TO:



	SHOT OF  HOUSEBOAT BEING TOWED BY A TUG DOWN THE RIVER (OR A 

	SEAPLANE LANDING) - TWILIGHT



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - TWILIGHT



	Jonah watching it.  Sam visible in the distance in the 

	kitchen.



	INT. KITCHEN - TWILIGHT



	As Sam is busy installing the spice rack.  He marks the 

	wall, hammers in the nails, etc.



				 SAM

			   (as he starts putting 

			    new spices into the 

			    rack, in alphabetical 

			    order)

		    Does red pepper go under R or 

		    P?



				 JONAH

		    P.

			   (beat)

		    Dad?



				 SAM

			   (absently)

		    What?



				 JONAH

		    I forgot to mention.  Jed 

		    called --



				 SAM

		    Just out of curiosity, do you 

		    have any friends whose names 

		    don't begin with a J?  I feel 

		    like it was a failure of the 

		    imagination on our part naming 

		    you Jonah.

		  	   (looking at the spices)

		    What is marjoram? Does anyone 

		    know?



				 JONAH

		    Jed is having a slumber party 

		    New Year's Eve and he invited 

		    me.



	A beat.



				 SAM

		    Fine.  Fine.



				 JONAH

		    So I can go.



				 SAM

		    Sure.

			   (almost done with the 

			    spices)

		    Looking good.



				 JONAH

		    Shouldn't you have used a 

		    toggle bolt?



				 SAM

		    I think I know how to have a 

		    spice rack.



	He puts in the last spice.



	They stand back to admire it.  A beat.  The rack falls 

	off the wall.



	The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the 

	glass jars of spices break.



	There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.  all 

	over the floor along with shards of glass.



				 SAM

	    	    God fucking dammit!  Shit! 

	    	    Fuck.  Piss.



	Jonah bursts into tears.



				 SAM

			   (still angry)

		    I'm sorry.

			   (softening)

		    I'm sorry.



	He picks up Jonah and holds him.



				 SAM

		    I'm sorry.  I'm just --



				 JONAH

		    Stressed.



				 SAM

		    Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm 

		    sorry.



	And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.  Sam closes his 

	eyes tight.



	INT. A TELEVISION SET OF NEW YEAR'S EVE ON TIMES SQUARE



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam, alone, watching the ball drop.  He's got a bag of 

	Doritos and a beer.



				 A VOICE

		    Can I have half your beer?



				 SAM

		    Sure.



	It's Maggie.



	She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a 

	glass.



				 MAGGIE

		    What did I used to say? Here's 

		    looking at you? Here's mud in 

		    your eye?



				 SAM

		    Here's to us.  You used to say 

		    here's to us.

			   (he looks at her and 

			    his eyes well with 

			    tears)

		    Oh babe.  I miss you so much it 

		    hurts.



	He reaches out for her.  She's gone.



	And we hear the television set now counting down to 

	midnight in New York.



							CUT TO:



	INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT



	The same television show counting down to midnight.



	Champagne corks popping, etc.



	And we see Walter and Annie.



				 WALTER

		    Happy New Year, darling.



				 ANNIE

		    Happy New Year.



	They start to dance.



				 WALTER

		    I was thinking, I have to go up 

		    to Boston for the AAP 

		    convention and then visit 

		    Winston-Hughes about switching 

		    over our computers.  Why don't 

		    we meet in New York for 

		    Valentine's Day weekend?



				 ANNIE

		    Walter, I'd love to --



				 WALTER

		    We'll stay at the Plaza --



				 ANNIE

		    Go for a walk in Central Park --



				 WALTER

		    Go to the Symphony --



	A beat.



				 ANNIE

		    We will?

			   (beat)

		    The Symphony?

			   (beat)

		    Okay.

			   (beat)

		    I'll take you to the Russian 

		    Tea Room for pelmeni.


				 WALTER

		    What is it?



				 ANNIE

		    It's delicious, trust me.



				 WALTER

		    Does it have wheat in it?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't think so.



	They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 

	everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 

	looks thoughtful.



	ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY



	Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 

	his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries.



	In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



	Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 

	his face.



	A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 

	front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 

	for the mail.



				 JONAH

		    Look at this, Dad.  They're 

		    all for you --



	Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 

	addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 

	Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 

	stunned.  As he signs the receipt:



				 MAILMAN

		    If you're having trouble 

		    sleeping, you might want to try 

		    drinking a glass of water from 

		    the other side.



				 JONAH

		    I thought that was for hiccups.



				 MAILMAN

		    Does it work for hiccups?



				 JONAH

		    For hiccups, a spoonful of 

		    sugar, you hold it in your 

		    mouth for a minute.



				 MAILMAN

		    Really?



	The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the door.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 

	at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 

	found by the door.



				 SAM

		    Just out of curiosity, how did 

		    they get our address?



				 JONAH

		    They called and asked for it.

			   (reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.  

		    You are the most attractive man 

		    I've ever laid ears on."



	Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 

	rejects, opens another.



				 SAM

		    How did they get our phone 

		    number?



				 JONAH

		    You have to give them your 

		    phone number or they won't let 

		    you go on the air.



	Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.



				 JONAH

			   (continues, reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    am an SWF"--

			   (to Sam)

		    What is that?



				 SAM

		    Thank God.  Something you don't 

		    know.  It's a single white 

		    female.



				 JONAH

		    This is no good.  She's looking 

		    for someone French.  Or Greek.

			   (puzzled, he throws the 

			    letter into the reject 

			    pile, opens another)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    live in Tulsa." Where is that? 

		    --



				 SAM

		    Oklahoma.  Do you know where 

		    that is?



				 JONAH

		    Somewhere in the middle.



				 SAM

		    I'm not going to think about 

		    what they're not teaching you 

		    in school.  I am not going to 

		    think about it.

			      (beat)

		    Generally speaking I think we 

		    should rule out people who 

		    don't live somewhere near here 

		    --



				 JONAH

		    She's willing to fly anywhere.



	As Jonah hands Sam the picture.



				 SAM

		    She looks like my third grade 

		    teacher.  I hated my third 

		    grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait 

		    a minute! She is my third 

		    grade teacher!



				 JONAH

		    Dad, you're not taking this 

		    seriously.



				 SAM

		    This is not how you do it.

			   (referring to the 

			    hamburger)

		    You want this on an English 

		    muffin or a bun?



				 JONAH

		    English muffin.  How do you do 

		    it?



				 SAM

		    You see someone you like, you 

		    get a feeling about them, you 

		    ask them if they want to have a 

		    drink or --



				 JONAH

		    -- a slice of pizza --



				 SAM

		    But not dinner necessarily on 

		    the first date because by the 

		    time you're halfway through 

		    dinner you might be sorry you 

		    asked them to dinner whereas if 

		    it's just a drink, if you like 

		    them you can always ask them 

		    for dinner but if you don't you 

		    can go home if you see what I 

		    mean.

			      (beat)

		    I wonder if it still works this 

		    way.



				 JONAH

		    It doesn't.  They ask you.



				 SAM

		    I'm starting to notice that.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter are making love.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    If you get a new wife, I guess 

		    you'll have sex with her, huh?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    What do you think?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Will she scratch up your back?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    What?



	JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy 

	bear while this conversation concludes.



				 JONAH

		    In the movies women are always 

		    scratching up guy's back and 

		    screaming and stuff.  When 

		    they're having sex.



				 SAM

		    Whose show was this on?



				 JONAH

		    Jed's got cables.



				 SAM

		    Go to sleep.



	He kisses him good-night.



				 JONAH

		    Kiss Howard.

			   (he holds out the 

			    teddy bear)

		    G'night, Howard.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter have just finished making love.



	Walter falling asleep.



	Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.



	She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe.



	INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE



	As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.



	She opens the door to the street.



	EXT. STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie starts to run down the street.



	CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING



	And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running 

	down.



	Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.



	Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.



	And another: Your feet are cold.



	And another: Will you find love.



	And another: Before you're cold?



	And another: Burma Shave.



	And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running 

	across a map of the United States -- it's a little like 

	the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's 

	like the famous map of the United States by Saul 

	Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one 

	is about Seattle.



	In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two 

	indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start 

	to wave at her, very slowly.



	Annie's eyes widen.



							CUT TO:



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep.



	She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did 

	in the dream sequence).



	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT



	As Annie comes down the stairs.



	INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE



	She turns the light on.



	Opens the refrigerator.



	Closes it.



	Opens it again.  Takes out some milk.



	Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, 

	banana.  She's about to assemble it when:



	She sees:



	THE RADIO



	She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia 

	Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn 

	flakes.



				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

		    Up next, "You and Your 

		    Emotions" with Dr.  Marcia 

		    Fieldstone, clinical 

		    psychologist and the best 

		    friend you never had.

			   (the teaser continues)



				 WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

		He says he doesn't love me any 

		more.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why do you want to be with 

		    someone who doesn't love you?



				 ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.)

		    Every time I come close to 

		    orgasm he stops and goes to 

		    make himself a sandwich --

	

				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why don't you make him a 

		    sandwich beforehand?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    When I met my wife, it was so 

		    clear.  I jus knew.



	Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What was it that made you know?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    And if I could describe it, it 

		    probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.  

			      (continuing)

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like... 

		    magic.



	Annie closes her eyes.



				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

		    We'll be back after this 

		    commercial with Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone.



	EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



	We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the 

	Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car.



	INT. LIBRARY - DAY



	As Annie strides purposefully across the library and 

	enters:



	INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY



	Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his 

	desk.  We barely has time to look up.



				 ANNIE

		    I think I'm going crazy, Tom.  

		    I really do.  Are you happily 

		    married?



				 TOM

			   (completely panicked by 

			    the question)

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    I mean, why did you get 

		    married? Was it all fireworks 

		    and trumpets and --



				 TOM

			   (regaining composure)

		    I got married because Betsy 

		    said we had to break up or get 

		    married.  So we get married.



				 ANNIE

		    But when you met her, did you 

		    believe she was the only person 

		    for you? That in some mystical, 

		    cosmic way, it was fated?



				 TOM

		    Annie, when you meet someone 

		    and you're attracted to them, 

		    it just means that your 

		    subconscious is attracted to 

		    their subconscious, 

		    subconsciously.  So what we 

		    think of as chemistry is just 

		    two neuroses knowing that they 

		    are a perfect match.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't even know him.  But 

		    I'm having all these fantasies 

		    about a man I've never met, 

		    who lives in Seattle.



				 TOM

		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



				 ANNIE

		    I know, I know.  I do not want 

		    to move to Seattle.  But what I 

		    really don't want to do is end 

		    up always wondering what might 

		    have happened and knowing I 

		    could have done something.  

		    What do you think?

			   (Tom opens his mouth to 

			    say something, but 

			    before anything comes 

			    out, Annie fills the 

			    void)

		    It's just cold feet, isn't it? 

		    Everyone panics before they get 

		    married, didn't you?



				 TOM

		    Yes, I did.



				 ANNIE

		    Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much 

		    better just having blown this 

		    off.



				 TOM

		    Any time.



	INT. PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



	As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit.



	EXT. A DOOR OPENING TO SEATTLE STREET - DAY



	Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the 

	street.



				 JAY

		    Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda

		    ... She's a weightlifter, but 

		    it's not like her neck is 

		    bigger than her head or 

		    anything --



				 SAM

		    I'm not asking you to set me 

		    up, Jay.  That's not what I 

		    need your help for.  I want to 

		    know what it's like over there.



				 JAY

		    And that's what I'm trying to 

		    tell you.  What women are 

		    looking over, okay? Pecs and a 

		    cute butt.



				 SAM

		    You mean, like, "He has the 

		    cutest butt"? Where did I hear 

		    that recently?



				 JAY

		    Everywhere.  You can't even 

		    turn on the news without 

		    hearing about how some babe 

		    thought some guy's butt was 

		    cute.  Who the first babe to 

		    say this was I don't know, 

		    but it caught on.



	INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - DAY



	Sam and Jay at the counter.  Out the window, we can see 

	water.



				 JAY

		    When's the latest time you were 

		    out there?



				 SAM

			   (trying to remember)

		    Seventy... eight.



				 JAY

		    Well.  Things are different.  

		    First, you have to be friends.  

		    You have to like each other.  

		    Then you neck.  This can go on 

		    for years.  Then you have 

		    tests.  Then you get to do it 

		    with a condom.

			   (beat)

		    The good news is, split the 

		    check.



				 SAM

		    I don't think it could let a 

		    woman pay for dinner.



				 JAY

		    Great.  They'll have a parade 

		    in your honor.  You'll be Man 

		    of the Year in Seattle 

		    Magazine.  Tira misu.



				 SAM

		    What's tira misu?



				 JAY

		    You'll find out.



				 SAM

		    What is it?



				 JAY

		    You'll see.



				 SAM

		    Some woman is going to want me 

		    to do it to her and I'm not 

		    going to know what it is.



				 JAY

		    You'll like it.



				 SAM

			   (grimly)

		    This is going to be tougher 

		    than I thought.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



	Sam coming home.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



	As he enters.  It's very quiet.  Too quiet.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	No answers.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	He starts to look concerned.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is 

	shut.  He opens it.



	Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.  

	Earphones on.  Next to him is a young girl named 

	JESSICA.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	Jonah takes off the earphones.



				 JONAH

		    Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.



				 SAM

		    It's nice to meet you, Jessica.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, this is amazing.  If you 

		    play this backwards, it says 

		    "Paul is dead."



				 SAM

		    I know.



				 JONAH

		    How do you know?



	Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, could you close the door?



				 JESSICA

		    H and G.

			   (Sam looks back)

		    Hi and goodbye.



	Sam closes the door to Jonah's room.



	Hold on Sam.



				 SAM

			   (to himself)

		    Get a life.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS



	As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.  Closes 

	the door.



	INT. SAM'S OFFICE AT HOME - CONTINUOUS



	He goes to the phone.  Looks up a number in the phone 

	book.  Picks up the phone and dials a number.



				 SAM

		    Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam 

		    Baldwin, I don't know if you 

		    remember me.  Oh?  Well, great.  

		    I was wondering if you wanted 

		    to have a drink... Friday, 

		    say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner 

		    would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner.



	INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM 

	- NIGHT



	Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, 

	tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are 

	you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not 

	now."



	She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces 

	of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully 

	typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.



				 ANNIE

		    Now those were the days when 

		    people knew how to be in love.



	She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.  

	Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to 

	type and sob and look at the TV.



				 BECKY

		    You're a basket case.



				 ANNIE

			   (as she types)

		    They knew it.  Time, distance, 

		    nothing could separate them.  

		    Because they knew.  It was 

		    right.  It was real.  It was...



				 BECKY

		    ... movie.

			   (beat)

		    That's your problem.  You don't 

		    want to be in love.  You want 

		    to be in love in a movie.

			   (beat)

		    Read it to me.



				 ANNIE

			   (reading her letter)

		    "Dear Sleepless and Son..."



				 BECKY

		    It sounds like the name of a 

		    mattress store --



				 ANNIE

		    "I am not the sort of person 

		    who listens to call-in radio 

		    shows" --



	Becky flops on the couch.



				 BECKY

		    And this woman is a writer! 

		    That's what everyone writes at 

		    the beginning of letters to 

		    strangers.



				 ANNIE

		    I know that.  You think I don't 

		    know that? "I know that's a 

		    dumb way to begin, but it's the 

		    only way I can think of to 

		    convey what happened to me the 

		    other night when I heard the 

		    two of you on the radio.  On 

		    the other hand, maybe I'm just 

		    losing my mind."



				 BECKY

		    You are.  You're losing your 

		    mind.  What about Walter?



				 ANNIE

		    I'm going to marry Walter.  I 

		    just have to get this out of my 

		    system.



				 BECKY

		    Right.



				 ANNIE

		    I should say something in this 

		    about magic.



				 BECKY

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know.  I mean, what if 

		    I never meet him? What if this 

		    man is my destiny and I never 

		    meet him?



				 BECKY

		    Your destiny can be your doom.  

		    Look at me and Rick.



				 ANNIE

			   (typing some more)

		    "I want to meet you..."



	Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State 

	Building?"



				 BECKY

		    "On top of the Empire State 

		    Building at sunset on 

		    Valentine's Day."



				 ANNIE

		    Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New 

		    York with Walter, I can squeeze 

		    it in.



	She types in Becky's idea.



	Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, 

	smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and 

	into Becky's lap.



				 BECKY

		    You want to hear about destiny? 

		    If my husband hadn't gone on a 

		    diet, which caused me to leave 

		    him, I would never have been on 

		    that flight to Miami, and met 

		    Rick, and ended up having sex 

		    in the bathroom of a 727 with 

		    that nob you slide that says 

		    "vacant-occupied, vacant-

		    occupied, vacant-occupied" --

			   (she shudders in 

			    ecstasy, then pulls 

			    herself together)



				 ANNIE

		    You never told me you left your 

		    husband because he went on a 

		    diet.



				 BECKY

			   (nods; after a beat)

		    He lost all the weight... 

		    there.



				 ANNIE

		    That's impossible.  A guy can't 

		    --



				 BECKY

		    Can too.



				 ANNIE

		    No.



				 BECKY

		    Yes.



				 ANNIE

		    And then you left him? He lost 

		    weight there and you left him?



				 BECKY

		    Plus he fell in love with a 

		    temp.



				 ANNIE

		    Listen to this, I love this 

		    part --



	Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never." And Cary Grant 

	says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." 

	Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no 

	warm memories."



	Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.



				 BECKY

		    Men never get this movie.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.



				 BECKY

		    Do you think at the end of the 

		    movie when she's in the 

		    wheelchair they can still do 

		    it?



				 ANNIE

		    I always wondered about that 

		    too.



	As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM



	A Kleenex being pulled from a box.  Sam is giving it to 

	Jonah, who's up.  His hair is mated with perspiration.



				 SAM

		    It's okay, it's okay.  I'm 

		    here.



	A beat while Jonah calms down.



				 JONAH

		    It was sinking.



				 SAM

		    What was?



				 JONAH

		    Our house.  There was water 

		    coming in all the windows.



				 SAM

			   (calm and definite)

		    You're worried we're going to 

		    be all right.  We're going to 

		    be all right.

			   (Sam gives Jonah a 

			    squeeze)

		    I remember sometimes you'd have 

		    nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 

		    would hold you and rock you and 

		    sing you a song.



				 JONAH

		    Bye bye blackbird.



				 SAM

		    Is that what she used to sing?



				 JONAH

		    I miss her.

			   (beat)

		    What do you think happens to 

		    someone after they die?



				 SAM

		    I don't know.



				 JONAH

		    Like do you believe in heaven?



				 SAM

		    I never did.  Or the whole idea 

		    of an afterlife.  But I don't 

		    know any more.  I have these 

		    dreams about... your mom... and 

		    we have long talks about... 

		    about you, and how you are, 

		    which she sort of knows but I 

		    tell her anyway.  So what is 

		    that? It's sort of an afterlife, 

		    isn't it?



				 JONAH

		    I'm starting to forget her.



				 SAM

		    I know.  But she's here, Jonah.  

		    Because I have you.  And as 

		    long as I have you, I have your 

		    Mom.



	Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 

	Blackbird.



				 SAM

		    I... uh... have a date with 

		    someone Friday night.



				 JONAH

		    Good.



	A beat.



				 SAM

		    Did I ever tell you about the 

		    time I ate a dog biscuit?



	As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK 

	FROM THE BED AND...



							CUT TO:



	EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT



	AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her 

	car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and 

	stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and 

	think.  She crosses the street into a little 

	neighborhood park.  We can see the moon.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck 

	chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon.  

	The MUSIC CONTINUES.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. PARK - NIGHT



	Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.  

	MUSIC CONTINUES.



							CUT TO:



	CLOSE ON SAM



	CLOSE ON ANNIE



	AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING



	As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled 

	out of.  Annie starts toward him.



	A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT



	Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late 

	tonight, blackbird, bye bye.



	FADE IN:



	INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY



	Annie on the phone at her desk.



				 ANNIE

		    Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm 

		    fine.  Listen, I'm doing an 

		    article on call-in radio shows.  

		    Do you know anyone who works 

		    for someone named Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone...?



							CUT TO:



	Annie on the phone.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm a writer for the Baltimore 

		    Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie 

		    Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece 

		    on how people handle 

		    bereavement and I understand 

		    that you had a caller the other 

		    night... I know you're not 

		    supposed to, but Laurie said 

		    you might, and I'll plug the 

		    show and everything --

			   (she winces in 

			    anticipation of a 

			    rejection, but then 

			    her face relaxes)



							CUT TO:



	Annie dialing Sam's telephone number.



				 JONAH (ON MACHINE)

		    This is Jonah Baldwin, we're 

		    not in right now but you can 

		    leave --



	Annie hangs up.



				 ANNIE

		    Baldwin.



							CUT TO:



	Annie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number.  

	We hear some beeps.

							CUT TO:



	A PRINTOUT OF AN ARTICLE



	that Annie's reading.  There's a newspaper picture of 

	Sam at the dedication of a building site.  It's got that 

	kind of grainy quality that things have when they've 

	been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good 

	looks.



	EXT. BO'S SECURITIES/WORLDWIDE - DAY



	Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in 

	downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse.  

	Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance-

	chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner.



	The sign on the door reads: "No job too small." "All 

	major credit cards accepted." And then everything on 

	the sign is translated into Spanish.



	INT. BO'S SECURITIES - DAY



	Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk 

	listening to Annie.  He has some papers.



				 ANNIE

		    I need to know about him 

		    because... he's involved with 

		    my sister...



			    	 DET. WHEEDLE

		    Okay.



				 ANNIE

		    She has a pattern of getting 

		    involved with losers... Once 

		    she almost ran away with a 

		    human cannonball from the 

		    circus.



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    Do you want a matrimonial, past 

		    wives, any kids--



				 ANNIE

		    No, I know that part --



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    So you want a financial, is he 

		    a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --



				 ANNIE

		    No, no, no, it's more like, who 

		    is he, does he have a sense of 

		    humor, is he nice -- no forget 

		    nice, I've got nice --



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    A sense of humor.



				 ANNIE

		    I'll tell you the truth, I 

		    heard this guy on a call-in 

		    radio show and I might not 

		    marry the person I should marry 

		    because I've become obsessed 

		    with him.



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that 

		    movie.



				 ANNIE

		    No.  Not remotely.  I just want 

		    to find out about him.



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    You want a tail.

			   (picking up the phone)

		    I got a guy in Seattle --



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is watching Geraldo with his babysitter, CLARISE, 

	17.

	Geraldo is talking to a heavily made-up, sexily-dressed 

	WOMAN.



				 GERALDO

		    So how long have you been a 

		    woman?



				 WOMAN

			   (husky voice)

		    About two weeks.



	Sam is coming down the stairs.



				 CLARISE

			   (to Jonah)

		    Pssst!



	Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to 

	the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed 

	for his date.



				 SAM

		    Clarise, I'll be back by 

		    midnight I'm sure --



				 CLARISE

		    Whenever.



	Sam tosses Jonah a letter.



				 SAM

		    This one's for both of us.



				 JONAH

			   (reading from the 

			    envelope)

		    Sleepless and Son.

			   (reading the postmark)

		    Baltimore.



	He starts to open the letter.



				 SAM

		    I left the number of the 

		    restaurant I'll be at if 

		    there's any emergency.



				 CLARISE

		    Fine.



				 SAM

			   (to Jonah)

		    How do I look?



				 JONAH

			   (absently)

		    Great.



				 SAM

			   (looks in mirror)

		    I look stupid.  I look stupid, 

		    don't I? I look like I'm 

		    trying too hard.  I was going 

		    to get a haircut but then I 

		    thought I'd look like I just 

		    got a haircut.

			   (checks his teeth, 

			    peers up his nose)



				 JONAH

			   (reading the letters)

		    This is a good letter, Dad.



				 SAM

			   (checks his fly, looks 

			    down at his feet)

		    The heels on these shoes are 

		    very large.  Why have I never 

		    noticed this? The heels on 

		    these shoes are grotesque.



				 JONAH

		    Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.



				 SAM

		    Now I'm late.  Bye.



	He starts toward the door.



				 JONAH

		    Listen to this --



				 SAM

		    Not now, Jonah --



				 JONAH

		    Just this one part, okay?

			   (reading)

		    "I have been an excellent 

		    third-baseman for as long as I 

		    or anyone else can remember, 

		    and I guarantee you will not 

		    get one past me"



				 SAM

		    Jonah, I'm leaving --



				 JONAH

		    WAIT!!!

			   (Sam stops, amazed at 

			    Jonah's vehemence; 

			    Jonah continues 

			    reading)

		    -- "and while we're on the 

		    subject, let's just say right 

		    now that Brooks Robinson was 

		    the best third baseman ever.  

		    It's important that you agree 

		    with me on that because I'm 

		    from Baltimore."  Dad, she 

		    thinks Brooks Robinson is the 

		    greatest.



	Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the 

	letter.


	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



				 JONAH

		    Dad!



				 SAM

		    Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson 

		    is the greatest.



				 JONAH

		    It's a sign.



				 SAM

		    Oh, right.



	Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back 

	into the house.



				 SAM

		    Come here.  I want to show you 

		    something.



	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT



	As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is 

	hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah 

	in front of it.



				 SAM

		    Here is Seattle.

			   (moves his finger 

			    across the country)

		    And here is Baltimore.  Case 

		    closed.

			   (he pulls the map and 

			    it snaps back up)



				 JONAH

		    She doesn't want us to go to 

		    Baltimore.  She wants to meet 

		    us in New York City on 

		    Valentine's Day.  On top of the 

		    Empire State Building.



				 SAM

		    Perfect.  We'll be there.



	Sam goes out the door.  Jonah just looks down at his 

	letter, his hopes on hold.  Clarise switches the TV back 

	to Geraldo.



	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT



	Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous.  

	He looks up and spots:



	VICTORIA



	walking into the place.  She's attractive.  She waves 

	and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer 

	from the maitre d'.



	After a beat.



				 SAM

		    Hi.



				 VICTORIA

		    Hi.



	An awkward pause.



				 SAM

		    You look good.



				 VICTORIA

		    You look good yourself.



	Another pause.



				 VICTORIA

		    I thought you were never going 

		    to call me.



				 SAM

		    You did?



				 VICTORIA

		    I really wanted you to call me, 

		    and I thought you were never 

		    going to --



				 SAM

		    You could have called me --



				 VICTORIA

		    No way.  No way I was going to 

		    be the first woman you went out 

		    with after...

			   (she gestures 

			    helplessly)

		    There is no percentage 

		    whatsoever in being the first 

		    woman anyone goes out with 

		    after...



				 SAM

		    You are the first woman I'm 

		    going out with.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh.



				 SAM

		    So whatdya say? I'll get the 

		    check, and I'll call you in 

		    eight months.



	Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh, you are funny --



	We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES.

	Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is 

	walking with Det. Wheedle toward a table you stand at 

	near the clam bar.



				 ANNIE

		    Tell me he's living in squalor.  

		    Tell me everything he has is 

		    being repossessed, including 

		    his filthy, dented mobile home.



				 WHEEDLE

		    He's got a houseboat.



				 ANNIE

		    I hate boats.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It sounds nice.



				 ANNIE

		    Boats.  You go out in them.  

		    You come back in them.  I hate 

		    them.



				 WHEEDLE

		    Houseboats don't go anywhere.



				 ANNIE

		    Boats.  All anyone talks about 

		    is the wind.  Is it up, is it 

		    down.  I can't live with a man 

		    who only talks about the wind.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It's not a boat boat.  It's 

		    really a house.



				 ANNIE

		    But it's on the water.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It's on the lake right in the 

		    middle of Seattle.

			      (beat)

		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



				 ANNIE

		    I hope I don't have to pay for 

		    that piece of information.



				 WHEEDLE

		    No, that's free.  He's an 

		    architect.  Used to do big 

		    high-profile projects.  He 

		    scaled it all back when his 

		    wife died.  Now he remodels 

		    people's homes.  He works in 

		    a small firm, makes a good 

		    living.



	He shows her a good picture of him.



				 ANNIE

		    He's real.



	She goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and 

	Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of 

	Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair.



	Hold on Annie's face.



	INT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE



	With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost 

	identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace.



	Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking 

	around, slightly distracted.



				 JONAH

		    I figure we could go to New 

		    York, catch the Knicks, and 

		    since we'd be there anyway, 

		    obviously we'd go to the Empire 

		    State Building --



				 SAM

		    There she is.



	As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of 

	groceries.



				 JONAH

		    Why is she bringing that bag?



				 SAM

		    She's going to cook something 

		    for us?



				 VICTORIA

		    Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- 

		    you must be Jonah.



				 JONAH

		    Hi.

			   (back to the subject)

		    He should book now because we 

		    can get an excursion fare.  

		    Jessica's parents are travel 

		    agents and --



				 SAM

		    Not now, Jonah.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER



	Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, 

	finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.



				 SAM

		    We can't finish the job.  She's 

		    on her sixth painter, now she's 

		    thinking maybe she wants the 

		    fireplace rebricked --



				 VICTORIA

		    I know her pretty well.  Maybe 

		    I could call her --



				 SAM

		    I've already solved it.  I've 

		    hired a hit man.



	Victoria laughs a little too hard.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh that is so funny, you are so 

		    funny.



	Sam smiles.  Jonah is appalled.



				 SAM

		    Every time she wants to change 

		    something, she talks in this 

		    little baby voice --

			   (in a little baby 

			    voice)

		    "Couldn't you just move the 

		    stairway a teeny tiny bit?"--



	Victoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to 

	slits.



				 JONAH

		    Do you like baseball?



				 VICTORIA

		    Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has 

		    box seats for the Mariners.  

		    Why don't we all go next week?



				 JONAH

		    What about camping?



				 VICTORIA

		    What about it?



				 JONAH

		    Do you like it?



				 VICTORIA

		    I went camping once.

			   (to Sam)

		    I love to brush my teeth in a 

		    brook and floss with a weed.



				 JONAH

		    We ought to start camping 

		    again, Dad.



				 SAM

		    Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.



				 JONAH

		    It's only ten o'clock.



				 SAM

			   (a little edgy)

		    Jonah!



				 JONAH

		    Okay.



				 SAM

		    Thank Victoria for dinner.



				 JONAH

		    Thanks for dinner.  I never saw 

		    anybody cook potatoes that way.



				 SAM

			   (gracious)

		    I'm glad you liked it.  Good 

		    night, Jonah.



	They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway.



	EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - REAR DECK - ON SAM & VICTORIA



	They're standing at the rail, talking.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window 

	at them.



	Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm.



	Jonah is horrified.



	He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	A sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the 

	ringing of her phone.



				 ANNIE

			   (groggy)

		    Hello.



				 BECKY

			   (through filter)

		    Turn on your radio!



				 ANNIE

		    What?



				 BECKY

			   (through filter)

		    The kid is on.  You've got me 

		    listening to this garbage.  

		    Go on, turn it on.



				 WALTER

		    Who is it?



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, it's just Becky, she's 

		    having trouble with Rich again.

			   (into phone)

		    Hold on, Becky, I'm going 

		    downstairs.



	She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed.



	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT



	As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up 

	the phone.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    This is a complete disaster.  I 

		    wanted him to find a wife, but 

		    he's got the wrong one --



				 ANNIE

		    How am I going to explain this 

		    to Walter?



				 BECKY (V.O.)

		    Shhh, listen to this --



	Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone 

	receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself 

	inside.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Shouldn't your father be the 

		    judge of whether she's right 

		    or wrong?



	ON JONAH



	sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks.  

	Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps 

	them behind him.



				 JONAH

		    Please, please don't make me 

		    sick.  He's not sane enough to 

		    judge anything.  She's a ho.



	ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BROOM CLOSET, WITH THE TELEPHONE 

	CORD LEADING INTO IT.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

			   (muffled slightly)

		    My dad's been captured by a ho.



	Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.  Jonah 

	ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware 

	that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.



				 VICTORIA

		    Is he there?



				 SAM

			   (turning back)

		    No.

			   (beat)

		    After he was born, every time 

		    we started to make love, he 

		    would cry.  He had an uncanny 

		    sense of timing.  We really 

		    shouldn't do anything here 

		    anyway.



				 VICTORIA

		    Absolutely.  Right.



	And she moves in to kiss him.



	ON JONAH



	Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the 

	coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a 

	kiss.



				 JONAH

		    Oh God, it's major.  He's 

		    kissing her on the lips.  I 

		    have to stop this.



	ON BROOM CLOSET



				 ANNIE

			   (muffled)

		    Come on, Jonah --



				 BECKY (V.O.)

		    Do something --



	ON JONAH



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Jonah, you can't butt in here.



				 JONAH

		    Yes, I can.



	He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.



							CUT TO:



	ANNIE AS THE BROOM CLOSET DOOR OPENS.



	SHE SCREAMS.



	It's Walter.



				 WALTER

		    Miss Scarlett.  In the broom 

		    closet.  With the radio.



				 ANNIE

			   (to Becky)

		    I gotta go.  I'll see you at 

		    work.

			   (she hangs up, turns 

			    off radio)

		    Walter, you scared me.  Don't 

		    ever do that again.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	As Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders.



				 SAM

		    Don't ever do that again.



				 JONAH

		    I thought I saw a black widow 

		    spider.



	Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah.



				 SAM

		    What are you doing up?



				 JONAH

		    I was thirsty.



				 SAM

		    There's a bathroom upstairs.



				 JONAH

		    The water tastes better in the 

		    kitchen.



				 SAM

		    That's true.  Why is that?



	INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT



	As she and Walter go upstairs to bed.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky heard this woman on the 

		    radio complaining about this 

		    guy she was sure was Rick, 

		    which meant he was cheating on 

		    her.  She was completely 

		    hysterical.  Then it turned out 

		    the woman lived in Duluth.



				 WALTER

		    That doesn't make any sense.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.  It makes no sense at 

		    all.  Thank God my life is in 

		    place.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Walter asleep.  Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide 

	awake.  Thinking.



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling, 

	wide awake.  Thinking.



	INT. JESSICA'S PARENTS' TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY



	Jessica is reading the letter from Annie.  She's sitting 

	at a computer in their travel agency, which is on the 

	entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.  Jonah 

	sitting there.



				 JESSICA

		    Write her.



				 JONAH

		    You think so?



				 JESSICA

		    It's Y. O. H.



				 JONAH

			   (agreeing)

		    Yeah.

			   (a beat)

		    What's that?



				 JESSICA

		    Your only hope.



	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY



	Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky.



				 ANNIE

		    I thought I would look into 

		    doing a story about those radio 

		    shows.



				 BECKY

			   (nods; after a beat)

		    You'd probably have to go 

		    somewhere to really look into 

		    it.



				 ANNIE

		    Definitely.



	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER



	Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the 

	mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF 

	BRAKES.  It's Sam's car.



				 SAM

			   (angry)

		    Get in the car right this 

		    minute.



	Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica.



				 JESSICA

		    I'll call you later.



	Jonah gets in.



	INT. SAM'S CAR - CONTINUOUS



				 SAM

		    Did you call that radio station 

		    again?



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    Everyone at work heard you.



				 JONAH

		    I just called for a second.



				 SAM

		    Long enough to call Victoria a 

		    ho.



				 JONAH

		    It's a short word.



				 SAM

		    This is not a joke.  Thank God 

		    Victoria doesn't know.  It 

		    would really have hurt her 

		    feelings.



				 JONAH

			   (really getting into 

			    it)

		    If she knew, she'd never 

		    forgive me.  It would be 

		    hopeless for the two of you.

	EXT. BALTIMORE RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie and Walter get out of the car, dressed for a 

	dinner.



				 WALTER

		    Couldn't you just do a phone 

		    interview?



				 ANNIE

		    Not for the kind of place I 

		    want to do.  I won't be in 

		    Chicago that long.



				 WALTER

		    When you get back, I'll be 

		    gone --



				 ANNIE

		    And then I'll see you in New 

		    York --



				 WALTER

		    Okay, okay.



	EXT. BALTIMORE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY



	A 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the 

	winter sky.



	INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY



	Annie is looking out the window, preoccupied.



				 PILOT'S VOICE

		    This is Captain Foster 

		    welcoming you aboard Flight 132 

		    to Seattle.  Our flying time 

		    today...



				 ANNIE

		    Do you believe that any lie is 

		    a betrayal? That's what Harold 

		    Pinter says, but it seems to me 

		    it's a very harsh way of 

		    drawing the line.



	Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate, 

	who in any case doesn't speak English, completely 

	mystified.



	INT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, 

	watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound 

	for Minneapolis.



				 VICTORIA

			   (turning to Jonah)

		    Can I bring something back for 

		    you? A souvenir?

			   (to Sam)

		    Does he like those little snow 

		    scenes?

			   (to Jonah)

		    You know -- you shake them up 

		    and the snow floats down?



	Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.  Be nice or else.



				 JONAH

			   (extremely polite)

		    Sure.  I'd really like that.  

		    Thank you so much.



				 VICTORIA

		    Well...



				 JONAH

		    I think they're announcing your 

		    flight.



	Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.



				 SAM

		    He's ten.



				 VICTORIA

			      (he's good at it)

		    He's good at it.



				 SAM

		    I read an article about this

		    ...



				 VICTORIA

		    I read the same article...



				 SAM

		    It takes time --



				 VICTORIA

		    Absolutely.  When I come back, 

		    maybe the two of us should 

		    spend some time together, on 

		    our own.  What do you think?



				 SAM

		    Sure.  Sure.



	Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.  

	As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his 

	finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.



				 SAM

			   (impatiently)

		    Jonah, this isn't fair.  You 

		    don't know Victoria.  I hardly 

		    know her myself.  She is, in 

		    fact, a mystery to me.  She 

		    tosses her hair a lot.  Why 

		    does she do this? I have no 

		    idea.  Is it a twitch? Does 

		    she need a haircut? Should she 

		    use barrette so it doesn't 

		    keep falling in her face? 

		    These are things that I'm 

		    willing to get to the bottom 

		    of, and that is why I am dating 

		    her.  That is all I am doing.  

		    I am not marrying her.  Can you 

		    appreciate the difference? 

		    That's what single people do, 

		    they try people on and they see 

		    if they fit.  But nobody fits 

		    perfectly, everyone is an 

		    adjustment.



				 JONAH

		    Was Mom an adjustment?



				 SAM

			   (complete exasperation)

		    I'm never going to meet anyone 

		    who's going to measure up to 

		    your mom in your eyes? What do 

		    you think? There's a perfect 

		    woman walking around out there?



	At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next 

	to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.



				 SAM

		    There's no such thing as a 

		    perf --



	Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by 

	her looks, her fluidity, her poise.



	Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches 

	from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.  

	Sam continues to stare at her.



				 SAM

			   (to himself, referring 

			    to Annie)

		    God, she's beautiful.



				 JONAH

			   (unaware he's talking 

			    about Annie)

		    Victoria? She's okay.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to 

	lose sight of Annie.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, I was talking to Jessica 

		    about reincarnation, and she 

		    thinks that probably you knew 

		    Annie in another life.



				 SAM

			   (completely distracted)

		    Who is Annie?



				 JONAH

		    The one who wrote us.



	Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he 

	doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because 

	he has to wait for Jonah.



				 JONAH

			   (continuing)

		    But Jessica says you and Annie 

		    never got together in that 

		    life, and your hearts are like 

		    puzzles with parts out of them 

		    and when you get together the 

		    puzzle's complete.



	He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight.



				 SAM

		    God dammit.



	A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows.  

	As they walk into the distance --



				 JONAH

		    The reason I know this and you 

		    don't is that I'm younger and 

		    purer so I'm more in touch with 

		    cosmic forces.



				 SAM

		    I sincerely hope you are not 

		    going to marry Jessica.



	EXT. AIRPORT CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY

	Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring 

	continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger 

	seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat.



	EXT. STREET FRONTING THE BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT SLIP -- DAY



	Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the 

	Baldwins' marina.  She stops, blocking the driveway to 

	the marina.



	ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR



	checking the map.



	Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks 

	into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in 

	their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into 

	their driveway.



	Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and 

	speeds away, tires squealing.



	EXT. SEATTLE GAS STATION - DAY



	Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room.



	INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY



	Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her

	She settles on the matter-of-fact reading.

	for a moment, then gains courage.  She starts to cross 

	the street to enter the dock.



	EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS



	Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.  Nervously.  Goes up 

	to the door.  Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.  No

	Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots

	They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken

	They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of 

	skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.



	ON ANNIE



	checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.



							DISSOLVE TO:

	They're throwing a football.  Jonah catches it and 

	starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and 

	feinting.  Sam tackles him and they tumble together on 

	the beach.



	CLOSE ON ANNIE



	watching.  The purity and innocence of this little scene 

	-- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more 

	than she ever could have imagined.  Their LAUGHTER

	Annie hangs up the phone.  She turns off the light.  

	Moonlight coming through the window.  Hold on her.



	EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - DAY



	Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.



	Sam's van pulls into a parking space.  Jonah in the 

	front with Sam.  They're diagonally across a four-lane 

	street.



	ON SAM AND JONAH



	As they start to get groceries out of the car.



	Annie watching.  This is it.  No chickening out this time.



	She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole 

	thing.  It's now or never.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.



	Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and 

	rightness with every step.



	But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:



	SUZY



	who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at 

	the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- 

	beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose 

	boys have just come back from the front.  Sam and Jonah 

	are overjoyed to see her.  Jonah breaks into a run, 

	nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings 

	up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped 

	when he started running.



	ON ANNIE



	She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.  

	In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to 

	bear.



	ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA



	Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious 

	than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam 

	and hugs them both.



	ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.



				 SAM

		    God, it's wonderful to see you.  

		    Where's Greg?



				 SUZY

		    He's over at the boat show.  

		    He'll be by later.

			   (she looks around)

		    It's so beautiful here.



	ANNIE



	There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about 

	this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the 

	middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all 

	she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.  

	She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --



	A TAXICAB



	coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.  

	Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van 

	bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps 

	back to the middle line.



	The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes.



	Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.  

	The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.



	Annie screams.



	The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the 

	other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.



	ON SAM



	responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near-

	accident.



	ON THE CAB DRIVER



	getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the 

	sidewalk.



				 DRIVER

		    Lady, what the hell are you 

		    doing?



	Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, 

	hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she 

	turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their 

	eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw 

	in the airport.



				 SAM

		    Hello.



				 ANNIE

		    Hello.



	Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything 

	that's happened, bolts for her car.



	Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is 

	coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets 

	into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, 

	deflated.

		    And what did you say?



	Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the 

	door.



				 ANNIE

		    All I could think of to say was 

		    hello.

	INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



	Becky and Annie looking at the television.



				 BECKY

		    It's a sign --



				 ANNIE

		    It's a sign I've watched this 

		    movie too many times.

			   (beat)

		    I'm so stupid.  From the minute 

		    I listen to that stupid program 

		    on the radio, I've been a 

		    complete jerk.



	She starts absently going through the mail, throwing 

	almost all of it away without even opening it.



				 BECKY

		    You don't know who she was, 

		    Annie --



				 ANNIE

		    I saw her.  She looked just 

		    like this --



	She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having 

	dinner.



				 BECKY

		    This is a photo of hair.



				 ANNIE

		    Well, it's the same woman.  And 

		    he was crazy about her.

			   (looking at one letter)

		    What is this?

			   (beat)

		    This is from Seattle.



	She opens the letter.



	Reads it.



	Looks up at Becky.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky?



				 BECKY

		    So I mailed your letter.



				 ANNIE

			   (reading the letter)

		    "Dear Annie: Thanks for your 

		    letter.  It was great.  We're 

		    very excited about meeting you 

		    in New York on Valentine's Day 

		    and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. 

		    Sleepless in Seattle."



				 BECKY

		    M.F.E.O.?



				 ANNIE

		    Made for each other.



	A long beat.



				 BECKY

		    It's cute.  It's like a little 

		    clue.



	Annie looks at her balefully.



				 BECKY

			   (continuing)

		    So he can't write.  Big deal.  

		    I mean, verbal ability is a 

		    highly overrated thing in a 

		    guy, and our pathetic need for 

		    it is what gets us into so much 

		    trouble.



				 ANNIE

			   (with resolve)

		    I'm going to run back to 

		    Walter's arms, if he's still 

		    have me.



				 BECKY

		    What about the letter?



				 ANNIE

		    It doesn't mean anything.  It 

		    was written before I went out 

		    there.  Before the ho.



	She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and 

	lights it.  They both watch it burn.



	CLOSEUP ON THE FIRE



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	A fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove.  Suzy is 

	sitting with her husband Greg and Sam.  Jonah is in 

	evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets, 

	asleep.  On the table near the couch is red construction 

	paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc.



				 SUZY

		    You saw her in the airport and 

		    then here?



				 SAM

		    I tried to talk to her...

			   (he shrugs)

		    It was like I knew her.  Weird.



				 GREG

		    Well, at least you're out there 

		    seeing people again.  That's 

		    terrific.



				 SAM

		    Well, just one really.



				 SUZY

		    How's Jonah taking it?



				 SAM

		    It'll take him a while to come 

		    around.  A month ago he called 

		    one of those radio call-in 

		    shows and told them I needed a 

		    wife --



				 SUZY

			   (charmed)

		    You're kidding --



				 SAM

		    Now that I'm seeing someone, 

		    it's a whole other thing.



	ON JONAH



	he's not asleep after all.  He's been listening all 

	along.



				 SAM

		    He's become obsessed with 

		    some woman who wrote me --



				 GREG

		    Are you serious?



				 SAM

		    She wants to meet me at the top 

		    of the Empire State Building.



				 SUZY

		    It's a little derivative.



				 SAM

		    What do you mean?



				 SUZY

		    "An Affair To Remember." Did 

		    you ever see it? Cary Grant 

		    and Deborah Kerr.  Before that 

		    it was called "Love Affair With 

		    Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."



				 GREG

		    Women love this movie.



	On Jonah, listening.



				 SUZY

		    They met at the Empire State 

		    Building, only they didn't.  

		    Never mind.



				 GREG

		    What kind of person would write 

		    to someone they heard on the 

		    radio?



				 SAM

		    I got hundreds of letters from 

		    women all over the country --



				 GREG

		    Desperate women --



				 SUZY

		    Just because someone's looking 

		    for a nice guy doesn't make 

		    them desperate.



				 GREG

		    How about rapacious and love-

		    starved?



				 SUZY

		    No.



				 GREG

		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist --



				 SUZY

		    It is not --



				 GREG

		    Right, right.



	Suzy's irritated.



				 SAM

		    Anyway, Victoria's nice.



				 SUZY

		    Would you follow her through an 

		    airport?



				 SAM

		    Look, I met somebody.  She's 

		    good, and capable and smart.  

		    We hit it off.  We can't spend 

		    your life chasing after 

		    fantasies.



	Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is 

	serious about Victoria.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - ON SAM IN BED - NIGHT



	The door to his bedroom opens.



	Annie walks in.  She's wearing a white men's shirt.



				 ANNIE

		    Hi.



				 SAM

		    Hi.

			   (a beat)

		    So far so good.  So.  What 

		    should we talk about? How 

		    insecure we were in high 

		    school.  Shirley Votypka, the 

		    first girl I ever felt up.  

		    Health.  What about health? 

		    Did you know that eating six 

		    macadamia nuts is the 

		    equivalent of eating a steak?



				 ANNIE

		    Shhhh --



	She unbuttons her shirt.



	And they kiss.



	FREEZE FRAME on the kiss.  It becomes the silhouette of 

	a man and a woman kissing.



	AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

	

	The silhouette of a man and a woman kissing on a red box

	EXT. BALTIMORE - VALENTINE'S DAY - DAY



	A few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop 

	windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts, 

	lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral

	ladies selling perfume.



	A red Valentine's envelope is being tossed on a desk,

	Annie at work.  She looks at the card and opens it.  

	It's from Walter.  She smiles.  Looks up.  There's 

	Becky.



				 BECKY

		    You're going to miss the train.



				 ANNIE

		    No, I'm not.

			   (she starts assembling 

			    her things)



				 BECKY

		    What are your plans in New 

		    York?



				 ANNIE

		    We're going to the Rainbow Room 

		    and the symphony tomorrow night.



				 BECKY

		    I love the symphony.



				 ANNIE

			   (cheerfully)

		    I hate it.

			   (she stands to go, 

			    starts toward the 

			    elevator)

		    I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I 

		    feel happy.  This is right.  

		    This is real.  Everything else 

		    is what happens when you watch 

		    too many movies and completely 

		    lose sight of what counts.

			   (as she steps into 

			    elevator)

		    Please don't tell anyone about 

		    what happened.  "Sleepless in 

		    Seattle" is history.



	INT. BALTIMORE TRAIN STATION - DAY



	Annie through the train window as the train starts to

	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY



	JONAH is watching with his little girlfriend JESSICA, 

	who's crying.



				 JESSICA

			   (weeping)

		    This is the best movie I've 

		    ever seen in my life.



				 JONAH

		    I don't get it.



				 JESSICA

		    You have to go to her, Jonah.  

		    You have to find her.



	Jonah nods.  But he isn't sure how he's going to do it.



				 JONAH

		    Do you know how much it costs 

		    to go to New York?



				 JESSICA

		    Nobody knows.  It changes 

		    practically every day.  How 

		    much money do you have?



				 JONAH

		    Eighty dollars.



				 JESSICA

		    I have forty-two.  So that 

		    would definitely cover 

		    taxicabs, I think.



				 JONAH

		    But how am I going to get 

		    there?



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Honey, I'm going out for a few 

		    minutes.

			   (sticking her head in 

			    the door to the living 

			    room)

		    Could you keep an eye on things 

		    out front till I get back?



	Jessica looks over at Jonah.



				 JESSICA

		    Sure.



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - TRAVEL AGENCY OFFICE - DAY



	Jessica is working on the computer.  She punches Jonah's 

	name into it.



				 JESSICA

		    Do you want an aisle or a 

		    window seat?



				 JONAH

		    Window.



				 JESSICA

		    Do you want a fruit plate?



				 JONAH

		    I don't know.  Do I?



				 JESSICA

			   (shrugs)

		    I'd rather die than eat on an 

		    airplane.

			   (beat)

		    I'm telling them you're twelve 

		    so you can fly unaccompanied 

		    and they won't make you be 

		    carried around by a stewardess 

		    and everything.



	Jonah nods.



	Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and 

	starts to fill it out for Jonah.



	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - TIFFANY'S - A SCULPTED GLASS HEART 

	- DAY



	formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in 

	pink light and spotlighted in white.



	Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples 

	mostly -- looking in the windows.  Each one a variation 

	on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken 

	Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out 

	of the wound in the middle.



	ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION



	in the Broken Heart window.



	They're both in their own worlds.  Then they both start 

	to speak at once.  They stop.  Annie looks at Walter.



				 ANNIE

		    You go.



				 WALTER

		    Ever since Christmas, you've 

		    been different.  Kind of 

		    distracted, distant.  But I 

		    feel like you're coming back 

		    from wherever you were.



				 ANNIE

		    I am.

			   (she smiles at him)

		    I was just... I just got... I 

		    think I got nervous.  It's 

		    normal, right? Don't you ever 

		    feel nervous about, you know?



				 WALTER

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    About forever.



				 WALTER

		    No.



				 ANNIE

		    Well, I did.  And you know what 

		    I think? I think that it was 

		    almost... too perfect.



	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



	As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department 

	to the elevator.



				 ANNIE

		    I started to wonder whether we 

		    were the human equivalent of 

		    two rights making a wrong, you 

		    know?



	Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely 

	good-natured about it.



	INT. THIRD FLOOR TIFFANY'S - DAY



	Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed 

	by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on 

	which she is noting their selections.



				 ANNIE

		    It was like kismet but not, if 

		    you see what I mean.



	Walter's brow furrows slightly.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    You have to grow up.  You can't 

		    have all these adolescent 

		    dreams about how exciting your 

		    life is going to be --



	Walter starting to look puzzled.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    Don't hate me but I love this 

		    pattern.



			    	 WALTER

		    You couldn't.



				 ANNIE

		    I do.



				 WALTER

		    It's just like my grandmother's 

		    china.



				 SALESWOMAN

		    How many place settings should 

		    I put down?



				 ANNIE & WALTER

		    Ten.



	Walter beams at her.



				 WALTER

		    Exactly.  Eight is too few and 

		    twelve is too many.



	The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper.



	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



	As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the 

	ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the 

	Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue 

	Tiffany's box he gives to Annie.



	Annie opens it.



	Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.



				 ANNIE

		    Walter.



				 WALTER

		    It was my mother's.



				 ANNIE

		    It's so beautiful.  It's just 

		    what I would have picked out if 

		    I'd had every ring in the world 

		    to choose from.

			   (as she slips the ring 

			    onto her finger)

		    You see what I mean.  There are 

		    people who would like a 

		    relationship to be full of 

		    surprises, but I am not one of 

		    them.

			   (as she starts out the 

			    door with Walter 

			    behind, thinking about 

			    what she has just 

			    said)

		    Surprises are highly overrated.



	As they go out the door to:



	EXT. FIFTH AVE.  - DAY



	As they start down the street and go off into the 

	distance.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    Promise me something, Walter.  

		    Promise me you will never have 

		    a surprise party for me.  Ever.  

		    You know what happens, you walk 

		    in the door in some horrible 

		    sweater you put on that morning, 

		    and there are hundreds of people 

		    in their best clothes shouting 

		    "Surprise!"



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.  Jonah is 

	standing in the doorway, watching.



	He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find 

	it.  He tries a few drawers.



				 SAM

		    Have you seen my wallet?



				 JONAH

		    It might be in the kitchen.



	Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen.



				 SAM

		    I'm only going to be away one 

		    night, okay, and Clarise will 

		    be here.  You'll have a swell 

		    time.  You'll watch a little 

		    Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm 

		    Street 12, I'll never know.



				 JONAH

		    Are you going with her?



				 SAM

		    Yes.



	Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to 

	his bedroom slam shut.



	ON SAM



	Starting to boil.



	He walks into --



	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT



	And open the door to Jonah's room.



	INT. JONAH'S ROOM - NIGHT



				 SAM

		    I have to have a life.  I have 

		    to do things that I want with 

		    people my own age.  It's none 

		    of your business who I am going 

		    out with.  I don't give a good 

		    goddam if you're angry --



				 JONAH

			   (holding up Annie's 

			    letter)

		    This is the one I like.



	Sam starts back to his bedroom.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



				 SAM

		    I don't care who you like.  

		    It's who I like.  But the truth 

		    is you're never going to like 

		    anyone because it isn't your 

		    mother.



	Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase.



				 JONAH

			   (yelling)

		    Fine.  I won't say anything.  

		    You can marry Count Dracula.



				 SAM

		    Thank you, Jonah.  But the 

		    point is, I am not asking 

		    permission.



				 JONAH

			   (yelling)

		    What's wrong with Annie?



				 SAM

			   (emphasizing every 

			    word)

		    Shut up.



	Jonah appears at the doorway.



				 JONAH

		    Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never 

		    did that.  Mom never said shut 

		    up to me.  Mom never yelled at 

		    me.



				 SAM

		    This conversation is finished.



				 JONAH

		    You said we could go to New 

		    York.



				 SAM

		    Did not.



				 JONAH

		    Did too.



				 SAM

		    I can't know what I said, but 

		    we're not going.



				 JONAH

			   (crossing his arms 

			    across his chest)

		    I'm not leaving this room until 

		    you say yes.



				 SAM

		    Get out.



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    Goddammit, I am sick of this 

		    --



	Sam picks Jonah up and carries him kicking and screaming 

	into:



	INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT



	and into:



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



				 JONAH

		    Put me down.  I hate you, I 

		    hate you --



	He throws Jonah on the bed.  Jonah in tears.



				 SAM

		    I'm sick of this phony 

		    melodramatic bullshit.  I'm 

		    sick of it.



	He leaves the room and slams the door.



	INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS



	Jonah weeping as Sam goes back to his bedroom.

		    And I'm leaving.



	No response.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?

			   (to Clarise)

		    He's probably still asleep.



	He opens the door gently to the room.



	Jonah's gone.



	IN QUICK CUTS:



	Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah.  In the main cabin.  

	The back deck.  Out onto the docks.  Looking all up and 

	down.  Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently 

	been looking in the neighborhood.  As she shakes her 

	head no, Sam goes to the bicycle shed.  Jonah's bike 

	still there.  Sam stands on the deck.



	EXT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	We see a group of people filing off an airport shuttle 

	bus.  The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to 

	"Marina."



	Jonah comes down the stairs and steps off with his 

	Mariners backpack.  He just stands there a beat, looking 

	around.  Then he goes through the glass doors.



	INT. AIRPORT FIRST CLASS TICKET COUNTER - DAY



	The TICKET CLERK turns back to the counter.

	Jonah steps forward, with his ticket.



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY



	Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of 

	the living room.  She is being interrogated but she is 

	not going to talk.  There's a clock on the mantel.  Sam 

	is in the room with Jessica's mother and father.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Jessica, this is not 

		    acceptable.



				 JESSICA'S FATHER

		    If you don't tell us right now, 

		    right this minute, I'm going to 

		    kill you.



	Jessica rolls her eyes.



	She looks over the clock on the mantel.  As it ticks 

	to 8:30:

		    He's on his way to New York.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    What?



				 SAM

		    How?



				 JESSICA

			   (the child of travel 

			    agents)

		    United 597.



	Jessica's mother and father are horrified.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Jessica!

		    Here you go... here's a nice pin 

		    for you, for flying with us.



				 JONAH

			   (completely unmoved,

		    Anyone check in a

	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - A FEW MINUTES LATER



	Jonah stands in a taxi line.



	INT. TAXI - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - AFTERNOON



	It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.



				 CABBIE'S VOICE

		    There it is.



	We are watching from:



	INT. A TAXICAB



	where Jonah, with his head out the window, regards the 

	building with awe.



				 CABBIE

		    What are you gonna do there, 

		    spit off the top?



				 JONAH

		    No.  I'm gonna meet...

			   (trying to figure out 

			    what to call her)

		    my mother.



	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



	Walter and Annie walking toward their table with the 

	MAITRE D'.



	Annie sits down, looks at the view.  Walter starts to 

	sit, revealing a spectacular view of the EMPIRE STATE 

	BUILDING directly behind him.  Annie's smile fades.



				 WALTER

		    Is something wrong.



	Annie shakes her head.



				 MAITRE D'

		    May I get you a drink?



				 WALTER

		    Some champagne?



				 ANNIE

		    Fine, fine.



	Walter glances back over his shoulder.



				 WALTER

		    Beautiful view, isn't it?



				 ANNIE

		    Walter, there's something I 

		    have to tell you --



	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DUSK



	As Sam rushes out of the terminal.  Desperate.



	A cab pulls up.  Sam bolts to the head of the line and 

	muscles his way into the cab.  The other people in line 

	are irate.



				 SAM

		    Sorry, this is an emergency.



	The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    Empire State Building.



	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING LOBBY - DUSK



	Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic 

	lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.



	EXT. TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - HELICOPTER SHOT - DESK



	Looking down on the observation deck.  The city below.  

	The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the 

	deck.  Looks around.



	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DUSK



	Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan, 

	heading for the Empire State Building.



	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DUSK



	Jonah is going to take the bull by the horns.  He walks 

	up to a likely-looking WOMAN.



				 JONAH

		    Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?



				 WOMAN #1

		    No.

			   (smiles at him)

		    I'm Cynthia.



	He spies another unattached woman.



				 JONAH

		    Excuse me, are you Annie?



	EXT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



	A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.



	And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is 

	actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:



	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - DUSK INTO 

	NIGHT



	Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.  He turns 

	around, forlorn.  He takes off his backpack and is about 

	to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the 

	observation deck.



	Jonah leaps into his arms.



				 SAM

		    You're my family.  You're all 

		    I've got.  What if something 

		    happened to you?



	Sam's eyes well up.  Jonah starts to cry.



				 SAM

		    What if I couldn't get to you?



				 JONAH

		    I was scared of what you were 

		    gonna do.



				 SAM

		    When I found you?



				 JONAH

		    If I didn't go.



				 SAM

		    Listen, have I ever done 

		    anything really stupid?



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    I mean, so far, have I screwed 

		    it up for you?



				 JONAH

		    No.



	The two of them hold each other tight.  After a beat:



				 SAM

		    I can't believe you flew first 

		    class.



				 JONAH

		    It was all they had.



	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses, 

	but neither of them has drunk a drop.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know what to say about 

		    it, Walter.  It was a form of 

		    temporary insanity.  But I had 

		    to tell you about it because --



				 WALTER

			   (matter-of-fact)

		    -- it was a betrayal.



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It 

		    was just...



				 WALTER

		    So what happened?



				 ANNIE

		    I told you.  Nothing --



				 WALTER

		    At the top of the Empire State 

		    Building --



				 ANNIE

		    I'm not at the top of the 

		    Empire State Building.  I'm 

		    here.



				 WALTER

		    Not really.

			   (beat)

		    Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's 

		    leave that out of it.  I don't 

		    want to be someone you're 

		    settling for.  I don't want to 

		    be someone anyone settles for.

			      (beat)

		    I have a life insurance policy,  

		    I'm fully invested in growth 

		    stocks, I have a paid 

		    subscription to Home Rox 

		    Office, I have no sexual 

		    diseases, I have been steadily 

		    employed in a part of the 

		    economy that isn't soft, I have 

		    expectation in the way of 

		    inherited wealth, I dress 

		    nicely, I am a member of the 

		    private sector, an independent 

		    voter, I don't watch Monday 

		    Night Football, the only thing 

		    wrong with me is that I am 

		    allergic to wheat, 

		    strawberries, penicillin, 

		    pollen, nuts and wool.  There 

		    are plenty of women who see me 

		    as the brass ring.  If you 

		    don't -- marriage is hard 

		    enough without bringing such 

		    low expectations into it, isn't 

		    it?



	Annie is nodding.  She wipes a tear from her face.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve 

		    you.



				 WALTER

		    I think that's what I'm saying.



	Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off 

	her finger and hands it to Walter.



	No bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle 

	with each other.



				 ANNIE

		    You okay?



				 WALTER

		    Yes.

			   (beat)

		    Some people will do anything to 

		    get out of going to a symphony.



	This breaks the tension.  Both of them smiles.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh!



				 WALTER

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    Look!



	Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie 

	sees:



	THE LIGHTS HAVE JUST GONE ON ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 

	VALENTINE LIGHTS:



	A huge pink and white heart.



	Walter turns back to Annie.



				 WALTER

		    Go for it.



	And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. WEST 50TH STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.



	As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.



	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT



	The lights are on all over the city.



	The crowd has thinned out considerably.  Jonah and Sam 

	are among the last people left.  They gaze out at the 

	twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.



				 ELEVATOR OPERATOR

		    Last call.  Closing time.



	Jonah looks at Sam.



				 JONAH

		    This is pretty dumb, wasn't 

		    it?



	Sam shrugs.



				 SAM

		    Big deal.



	After a beat.



				 SAM

		    Maybe we'll get a dog when we 

		    get back.



				 JONAH

		    Okay.



				 SAM

		    What do you mean, okay? 

		    Wouldn't you like a dog?



				 JONAH

		    Sure.



	Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the 

	elevator.



				 SAM

		    Let's go home.



	EXT. FIFTH AVE - NIGHT



	Annie's cab stuck in traffic.



	As Annie gets out of the cab.



	She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State 

	Building.



	INT. LOBBY OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



	Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators 

		    are closed.



				 ANNIE

			   (out of breath)

		    No.  Please.  I really need to 

		    get up there.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    We're closing up.  No more runs 

		    tonight.



	Annie takes a deep breath.  She's hit the end of the 

	road.  She turns to go but then turns back.



				 ANNIE

			   (out of breath)

		    Listen, can I just take a look? 

		    Maybe... maybe... There's 

		    someone I was supposed to 

		    meet... He's probably not 

		    there, but if I don't at least 

		    look I'll always wonder about 

		    it.



	The Information Booth Person looks at her.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    Cary Grant, right?



				 ANNIE

		    You know that movie?



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    One of my wife's favorites.



	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING



	After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very 

	empty platform.



				 ELEVATOR MAN

		    Sorry, ma'am.  Empty.



	Annie slowly walks out.



				 ANNIE

		    Can I take a minute?



				 ELEVATOR MAN

		    Go ahead.



	She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the 

	twinkling lights below.



	She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees 

	something on the floor.



	Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.



	She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be... 

	could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and 

	Jonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other 

	elevator DINGS.



	Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.



				 JONAH

		    I left it near the...



	And they stop.  There she is.  There they are.  Sam 

	can't believe it.  It's the mystery woman.



				 SAM

		    It's you.



				 ANNIE

		    It's me?



				 SAM

		    The one in the street.  I 

		    chased after you.



				 JONAH

		    Are you Annie?



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.



				 SAM

			   (confused)

	    You're Annie too?



	She smiles awkwardly.



				 ANNIE

			   (indicating the 

			    backpack)

		    Is this yours?



	Jonah walks over to her.  He puts his hand out.  She 

	shakes it solemnly.



				 JONAH

		    I'm Jonah.

			   (nodding back to Sam)

		    That's my dad.  His name is 

		    Sam.



				 ANNIE

		    Hi, Jonah.  Sam.

			   (indicating the teddy 

			    bear)

		    And who is this?



				 JONAH

		    Howard.



				 ANNIE

		    Howard.



	Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.  

	Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do 

	next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS 

	HIS THROAT.



				 SAM

		    We better go.



	Annie nods.



	Sam holds out his hand.



				 SAM

		    Shall we?



	Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable, 

	natural, right.



				 ANNIE

		    Sam?



	He looks at her.



				 ANNIE

		    It's nice to meet you.



	On Annie.



	On Sam.



	On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist 

	gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.



	EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



	WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic 

	confection, the world's largest Valentine.



	The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States 

	spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.



	And





	FADE OUT

	--------------------------------------------------------------
Sling Blade - by by Billy Bob Thornton
 

 
	FADE IN:
	
	INT. A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
	
	A few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man
	sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper
	with a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette
	and staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man,
	KARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his
	hands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring
	and Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant
	approaches Charles.
	
	                    ATTENDANT 
	          You can't smoke in here.
	
	Charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues
	smoking. He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then
	looks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          A Mercury is a good car and that's
	          what I was driving that day. I've
	          owned a lot of cars. Different
	          kinds. Lots of different kinds of
	          cars. She was standing, this girl,
	          on the side of the street where
	          there was a chicken stand; not the
	          Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
	          a chicken stand, and I pulled the
	          Mercury over and rolled down the
	          window by electric power. She was
	          wearing a leather skirt and she had
	          a lot of hair on her arms. I like
	          that. I like it a lot. It means a
	          big bush. I like a big bush. She
	          said, "Are you dating?" I said,
	          "yes," and she got in the car. We
	          pulled to a remote location, one
	          that she and I both felt
	          comfortable with and she said, "How
	          much can you spend?" I said, "What
	          it takes to see your bush. I know
	          it's a big one." She said "twenty
	          five dollars," which to a working
	          man is not chicken feed. I produced
	          the money and she put it in her
	          shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
	          before me lay a thin, crooked,
	          uncircumcised penis. You can
	          imagine how badly I wanted my
	          twenty-five dollars back.
	
	INT. A HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Two young women, MARSHA DWIGGINS, carrying a briefcase, and
	THERESA EVANS, carrying two camera bags are being led down
	the hallway by a GUARD.
	
	                    THERESA 
	          I don't know why you're so weirded
	          out, this is not San Quentin, it's
	          just a nuthouse. Most of these
	          people don't even know where they
	          are, they're not gonna hurt you.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          In a few minutes we're gonna be in
	          a room with a killer. That doesn't
	          bother you?
	
	                    THERESA 
	          Hey, you're the one that wanted to
	          major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't
	          the guy something like twelve or
	          thirteen when he did it, it was
	          twenty-five years ago, he probably
	          doesn't even remember it.
	
	                    MARSHA
	              (wrinkling her nose)
	          Do you smell shit?
	
	                    THERESA 
	          Yeah.
	
	They reach a door and the guard ushers them through.
	
	INT. AN OFFICE - DAY
	
	JERRY WOOLRIDGE stands up from behind the desk as they enter.
	He's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop
	class or perhaps eighth-grade science.
	
	                    GUARD
	          These are the people from that
	          newspaper deal.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Oh yeah, from the college?
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Yes sir.
	
	Woolridge shakes hands with them. 
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          My name's Jerry Woolridge.
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha
	          Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans.
	          She's here to take the pictures.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Y'all have a seat. Is this all of
	          you?
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          I think there must have been a
	          little mix up. I told your sponsor
	          or teacher or whatever he is, there
	          couldn't be any pictures. It's
	          s'posed to be just a little story
	          or article or something, isn't that
	          right?
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Well, yeah, it's for the school
	          newspaper. But it has pictures. I
	          mean it's a regular paper, you
	          know. 
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Karl's real sensitive about having
	          his picture made. He wouldn't even
	          be on the bulletin board for the
	          Easter Collage. 
	              (to guard) 
	          Melvin, would you get me a good hot
	          cup with two sugar substitutes? You
	          girls want some coffee?
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          No thank you.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          The other thing is I told your boss
	          on the phone to send a man. Karl
	          won't talk to women.
	
	INT. REC ROOM - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another
	monologue.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          There was a young man named John
	          Liggit Hunter who was in the
	          filling station business and a good
	          filling station business. He was
	          one of those young men that we run
	          across so often in life. I'm sure
	          you've run across them, that didn't
	          deserve the things he had. One of
	          those things was his beautiful
	          bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
	          Peach. As a matter of fact she
	          looked more like the picture I've
	          had in my head than any woman I've
	          ever seen. I took it upon myself to
	          take her away from John Liggit
	          Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
	          not sure if I mentioned that he was
	          a Frenchman who claimed to be an
	          Englishman. It took some very
	          strong nylon cord to take her away
	          from him. She was a fighter as well
	          as a Georgia Peach.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE
	
	The girls look confused.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I don't know what to tell you. I'm
	          sorry. I made myself pretty clear I
	          thought. He probably got busy and
	          wasn't thinking. I know how that
	          is. I used to teach shop and eighth
	          grade science.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Well, what do we do? We drove all
	          the way out here.
	
	                    THERESA 
	          Let's just go, Marsha.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          No, we have to get this story.
	
	                    THERESA 
	          I thought you'd be happy to leave.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Why won't he talk to women?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He has problems. You know. With all
	          that. He won't hardly talk to
	          anybody really. Just certain
	          people. He's very troubled.

	          A shovel just makes too goddamn
	          much racket.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	              (takes a drink of coffee)
	          I don't think he's talked to a
	          woman in twenty-five or so years.
	          That I know of anyway. That's why I
	          said to send a man. At least maybe
	          he'd answer a question or two for a
	          man. I'm all for helping the
	          college out, believe me. It might
	          be a real good article or story.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk
	          him into it. I'm a real good
	          interviewer. Just get me in the
	          room with him.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	              (to guard)
	          Melvin, go get Karl and take him
	          down to the old classroom.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Woolridge and the two women walk down the hallway.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I'll talk to him and see what we
	          can do.
	
	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
	
	Woolridge is opening a door. He enters and the women follow
	him in. He flips on a light switch and very bright florescent
	lights illuminate the room.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          You see, Karl, growing up, only
	          knew that sex was wrong and that
	          people who did it should be killed
	          for it. He couldn't really read
	          but, well, neither could his
	          mother. But, his father made sure
	          that his mother knew what the Bible
	          said. And she made sure Karl knew.
	          You know he slept in a hole in the
	          ground under a toolshed, right?
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          I knew he slept in a toolshed.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          His mother told him that he was
	          their punishment. Hers and his
	          father's; from God, for having sex--
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Before they were married?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I don't think so. Just period, I
	          think. She told him... God gave
	          them the ugliest creation he could
	          think of. Karl has an entire book --
	          a notebook. On every page it says
	          "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
	          1." He wrote that a few years ago
	          after he'd learned to write. His
	          father's name was Franklin.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          That's really strange. What does it
	          mean?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I
	          imagine. Y'all pull up a chair.
	          I'll go out and talk to him.
	
	INT. REC ROOM
	
	CLOSE UP on Charles's face.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          You have to make something explode
	          to truly understand it. You have to
	          examine the tiny particles while
	          they're on fire.
	
	Off screen we hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. We pull back and
	see MELVIN the guard.
	
	                    MELVIN 
	          Karl, I gotta take you down to the
	          old classroom. Mr. Woolridge has
	          some people for you to see down
	          there. Come on. Let's go.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Melvin and Karl walk down the hallway. Woolridge stands
	outside the door of the classroom. They reach him and
	Woolridge talks quietly to Karl.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Karl, you know, do you remember
	          when I told you about those people
	          from that newspaper? 
	              (pause)
	          They want to ask you some questions
	          about your release. They think it
	          would make an interesting story.
	          Will you talk to 'em? Get
	          interviewed. 
	              (pause)
	          Now, they're women. I think it
	          might be good for you to. You're
	          gonna be seein' all kinds of people
	          when you go on the outside. This'll
	          help you I believe.
	
	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
	
	It's just Woolridge and the two women in the room.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, it surprised the dickens out
	          of me. He said he'll talk to you.
	
	Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
	          But, here's the thing. He'll only
	          talk to you. He doesn't want you to
	          ask him anything. And you shouldn't
	          stare at him.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          How am I going to conduct an
	          interview if I can't ask him any
	          questions?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          It's the best you're gonna get. I'm
	          sorry.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Can I ask you a question? If he's
	          so troubled, why are you letting
	          him out? What if he does it again?
	          It happens all the time.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He's free. His time's up. That's
	          the rules. He's been treated and
	          reevaluated. He doesn't show any
	          signs any more.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Signs?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna
	          change the light in here for Karl.
	          I hope you can see to write.
	
	Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
	overhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in.
	In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions
	for Marsha to sit. Karl stands beside Melvin motionless.
	Woolridge whispers to Theresa.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
	          You'll have to step outside.
	
	Theresa starts to protest.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
	          Please.
	
	Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin
	ushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at
	the floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing
	strangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like
	forever.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Theresa stands on one side of the door, Melvin on the other.
	
	                    THERESA
	          Can I just sneak in there? I won't
	          take any pictures, I promise. I
	          just want to listen.
	
	                    MELVIN
	          No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.
	
	Theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light
	it.
	
	                    MELVIN (CONT'D)
	          You can't smoke in here. I'm sorry.
	
	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
	
	Marsha is staring at Karl. Karl, still breathing and rubbing
	his palms, starts to speak. His voice is low and raspy, but
	not just low and raspy; strange.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Well, I reckon what you're a
	          wanting to know is what I'm doing
	          in here. I reckon the reason I'm in
	          here is 'cause I killed somebody.
	          But I reckon what you was a wanting
	          to know is how come me to kill
	          somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start
	          at the front and tell you. 
	              (pause, heavy breathing)
	          I lived most of my life out behind
	          my mother and father's house in a
	          little old shed and my daddy'd
	          built for me. They didn't too much
	          want me up there in the house with
	          the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
	          around out there in the shed all
	          the time a lookin' at the ground.
	          It didn't have no floor but I had
	          me a hole dug out to lay down in
	          and a quilt or tow that I put down
	          there. 
	              (pause, more breathing)
	          My daddy was a hard workin' man
	          most of his life, not that I can
	          say the same fer myself. I most
	          just set around the shed and
	          tinkered around with a lawn mower
	          or two and went to school off and
	          on from time to time but the
	          children there made quite a bit of
	          sport of me, made fun of me quite a
	          bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
	          sometimes so mostly I stayed out
	          back there in the shed. My daddy
	          worked down at the sawmill there,
	          down there at the planer mill for
	          an old man named Dixon.
	          Old man Dixon was a very cruel
	          feller, he didn't treat his
	          employees very well, didn't pay 'em
	          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
	          much of a wage, just barely enough
	          to get by on. But I reckon he got
	          by all right, they come out one or
	          the other of 'em, usually my
	          mother, and fed me pretty regular.
	          At least I know he made enough for
	          me to have mustard and biscuits
	          three or four times a week. Old man
	          Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
	          Jesse was really more cruel than
	          his daddy. He made quite a bit of
	          sport of me and takened advantage
	          of the little girls around the
	          neighborhood quite a bit. 
	              (pause)
	          He used to say my mother was a very
	          pretty woman. He said it quite a
	          bit from time to time, when I was
	          at the school house. Well, I reckon
	          you want me to get on and tell you
	          what happened so I reckon I'll tell
	          you. I was settin' out in the shed
	          one evenin' not doin' too much,
	          just kindly starin' at the wall and
	          a waitin' fer my mother to come out
	          and give me my Bible lesson and I
	          heared a commotion up in the house
	          there so I got up and run up on the
	          screened-in porch there to see what
	          was a goin' on, and I looked in the
	          kitchen window and I seen my mother
	          a layin' there on the floor without
	          any clothes on. 
	              (pause, breathing)
	          And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
	          top of her having his way with her. 
	              (pause)
	          Well, I just seen red. I picked up
	          a kaiser blade that was a layin'
	          there by the screen door, some
	          folks calls it a sling blade, I
	          call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
	          long handle like a axe handle with
	          a long blade on it that's shaped
	          kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
	          edge and dull on the other. It's
	          what the highway boys use to cut
	          down weeds and whatnot.
	          I went in the kitchen there and I
	          hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
	          with it and knocked him off my
	          mother. I reckon that didn't quite
	          satisfy me so I hit him again in
	          the neck with the sharp edge and
	          just plumb near cut his head off.
	          Killed him. Well, my mother, she
	          jumped up from there and started
	          yellin', "What did you kill Jesse
	          fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
	              (pause, intense breathing)
	          Well, come to find out my mother
	          didn't really mind what Jesse was a
	          doin' to her. I reckon that made me
	          madder than what Jesse had made me.
	          I takened the kaiser blade, some
	          folks calls it a sling blade, I
	          call it a kaiser blade and hit my
	          mother up side the head with it an'
	          killed her.
	              (long pause, breathing)
	          Some folks has asked me if I had it
	          to do over again would I do the
	          same thing. I don't know, I reckon
	          I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
	          put me in here and here I've been
	          for a great long while. I've
	          learned to read some; took me four
	          years to read the Bible. I reckon I
	          understand a good deal of it. It
	          wasn't what I expected in a lot of
	          places. I've slept in a good bed
	          for a great long while. They've
	          seen fit to put me out now. They
	          tell me they're a settin' me free
	          today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
	          you need to know. If you want any
	          more details I reckon I can tell
	          'em to you. I don't know if that's
	          enough for your newspaper or not.
	
	Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Will you ever kill anybody again,
	          Karl?
	
	This seems to startle the very room itself. Woolridge motions
	for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still. Very still. He
	breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. He seems
	almost at ease. He slowly looks up. From Karl's point of view
	we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light. Karl is looking
	straight at Marsha.
	
	                    KARL 
	              (slowly)
	          I don't reckon I got no reason to
	          kill nobody.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with Marsha
	and Theresa. Karl stands down the way a few feet with Melvin.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Is he leaving right this minute?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          We've got some paperwork to take
	          care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry,
	          you won't run into him in the
	          parking lot.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          I didn't mean that.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I hope the best for you, Miss
	          Dwiggins, with your school and your
	          paper and all.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Where will he go?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Wherever he wants to. I think he's
	          going back to Millsburg where he's
	          from. It's just about twenty miles
	          from here.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Will he be supervised?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          As much as anybody else is, I
	          guess. Y'all have a good rest of
	          the day now.
	
	Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit. As they pass Karl he
	speaks to Marsha.
	
	                    KARL
	              (looking down)
	          Thank you.
	
	                    MARSHA
	              (immediately extends her
	               hand) 
	          Thank you.
	
	Karl doesn't take her hand.
	
	Karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
	          to looking at pretty people.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Yes, I guess you are.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
	          to them lookin' at me, too.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          You better go get your things.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't got nothing but them books.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          You better go get 'em.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	Karl walks slowly down the hallway.
	
	EXT. BUS STATION - MILLSBURG - DAY
	
	Karl steps off the bus carrying a few books by a strap. He
	stands there for moment staring at the bus station as the few
	people around stare at him, then he starts walking.
	
	A SERIES OF SHOTS
	
	Karl standing in front of a barbershop looking through the
	window at a man having his hair cut.
	
	In front of the police station.
	
	Staring at an empty school yard...
	
	EXT. DAIRY QUEEN - DAY
	
	Karl stands and stares at the building for a moment. He sees
	a woman take a tray of food from the window.
	When she's gone, he walks up to the window. A pimply-faced
	TEENAGE BOY comes to wait on him. 
	
	                    BOY
	          Can I help you?
	
	                    KARL
	          I was kindly wantin' somethin' or
	          'nother d'eat.
	
	                    BOY
	          Well, what did you want?
	
	                    KARL
	          You have any biscuits for sale?
	
	                    BOY
	          Naw, we don't have biscuits.
	
	Karl stands in silence for a moment.
	
	                    BOY (CONT'D)
	          Did you decide, sir?
	
	                    KARL
	          What you got that's good to eat?
	
	                    BOY
	          Well, I guess it's all good.
	
	                    KARL
	          What do you like to eat here?
	
	                    BOY
	          French fries. I like to eat them
	          pretty good.
	
	                    KARL
	          French-fried potaters.
	
	                    BOY
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL
	          How much you want fer 'em? I'll get
	          some of them I reckon.
	
	                    BOY
	          Sixty for small and seventy-five
	          for large.
	
	                    KARL
	          Give me the big'uns.
	
	Karl digs in his pocket for money.
	
	EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
	
	Karl sits on a bench eating french fries. After a moment, a
	twelve- or thirteen-year-old BOY comes out of the laundromat
	wrestling three or four big bags of laundry. He can't seem to
	get a plan together for carrying them all. Karl gets up and
	goes over to him. The boy looks up at Karl, a little startled
	by Karl's strange figure looming over him.
	
	                    BOY
	          These dang things are heavy. Hard
	          to carry, too.
	
	                    KARL
	          What you got in there, warshing?
	
	                    BOY
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL
	          Ain't you got no mama and daddy to
	          tend to it?
	
	                    BOY
	          I got a mama, but she's at work
	          over at Ben's Dollar Store. My
	          daddy's dead. 
	              (pause)
	          He got hit by a train.
	
	                    KARL
	          How fer you going with them sacks
	          full of warsh?
	
	                    BOY
	          About a half a mile I think it is.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'll help you tote 'em if I don't
	          give out first.
	
	                    BOY
	          Okay. You don't have to though.
	
	Karl picks up two sacks and they walk away.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	They walk in silence for a while before the boy finally
	speaks.
	
	                    BOY
	          My name is Frank Wheatley. What's
	          your name?
	
	                    KARL
	          Karl's my name.
	
	                    FRANK (BOY)
	          What's you last name?
	
	                    KARL
	          Childers.
	
	                    FRANK
	          What are all them books?
	
	                    KARL
	          Different ones. One's the Bible.
	          One of 'ems a book on Christmas.
	          One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          How come you're carryin' them
	          around with you.
	
	                    KARL
	          Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Don't you live somewhere?
	
	                    KARL
	          I did live there in the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Why'd you live there?
	
	                    KARL
	          I killed some folks quite awhile
	          back. They said I wadn't right in
	          the head and they put me in there
	          in the nervous hospital instead of
	          puttin' me in jail.
	
	                    FRANK
	          They let you out?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK
	          How come?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They told me I was well. They had
	          to turn me loose.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Are you well?
	
	                    KARL
	          I reckon I feel all right.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You don't seem like you'd kill
	          nobody.
	
	They reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up
	the sidewalk.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          This is my house. You can just set
	          those bags on the porch.
	
	Karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each
	other in silence for a moment.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Do you like to play football?
	
	                    KARL
	          I never was much count at it. I
	          never did get picked out fer it.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Me and the Burnett twins and some
	          boys plays down at the junior high
	          practice field all the time. If you
	          ever want to come by and play. We
	          ain't no good either. Well, I'll
	          see you later.
	
	He goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door.
	
	INT. BUS STATION - DAY
	
	Karl stands at the counter. A middle-aged man is selling
	tickets.
	
	                    KARL 
	          How does a feller go about gettin'
	          up to the state hospital?
	
	                    MAN 
	          You buy a ticket for fourteen
	          dollars and then set and wait for
	          the four-fifteen bus to Kelton.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
	
	Karl walks down the hallway carrying his books. A couple
	staffers give him 'Why are you still here' looks. He reaches
	a door and goes in.
	
	INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
	
	There is no one at the desk in the outer office, so Karl goes
	into Woolridge's office.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Karl finds Woolridge doing paper work. Woolridge looks up
	startled.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Karl, what in the world are you
	          doing here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I want to come back and stay here.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, you can't do that. You're a
	          free man. You've been let out to do
	          as you please.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I don't care nothin' about
	          bein' a free man. I don't know how
	          to go about it.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, you have to learn. It'll take
	          some time. Don't you know anybody
	          down there to help you out?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Your daddy's still livin' down
	          there from what you told me. 
	              (pause)
	          I guess he wouldn't help you any,
	          would he? I wasn't thinking. You
	          don't know anybody?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw. Never did know too much of
	          nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	              (sighs)
	          Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't
	          know where they expect you to go or
	          what they expect you to do. If it
	          was up to me, I'd let you stay here
	          if that's what you wanted. I'm just
	          doin' my job. 
	              (they sit in silence for a
	               moment)
	          You follow me? 
	              (no answer)
	          Listen, I know an old boy that runs
	          a fix-it shop deal down in
	          Millsburg. He used to go to church
	          with me. You're good workin' on
	          small engines and things. If I put
	          my neck out for you with him, will
	          you work at it if he'll hire you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn
	          mowers and whatnot.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I know, I've seen it myself. Would
	          you give that a try?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I can't promise he'll hire you.
	          I'll have to tell him about your
	          history.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I never was no good with history.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          No, I mean your past. About why you
	          were in here. 
	              (pause)
	          I'll take you first thing in the
	          mornin'. You have anyplace you can
	          stay tonight at all?
	          I just can't let you stay here.
	          It's the rules. If something
	          happened well, I'd be liable.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I can just walk around
	          till the mornin'. Or set and read
	          me a book somewhere.
	
	They sit and stare at each other for a moment.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE DEN - NIGHT
	
	Woolridge, his WIFE, his teenage SON, BUBBA, and teenage
	DAUGHTER sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely
	uncomfortable and staring at Karl, who is sitting on the edge
	of a chair looking at the floor. After a long creepy moment,
	Mom speaks.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE
	          Karl, would you like a muffin?
	
	                    KARL
	          No thank ye.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE
	          I understand Jerry is going to take
	          you somewhere else tomorrow.
	
	                    KARL
	          I don't reckon I know nobody name
	          Jerry.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          She's talkin' about me, Karl.
	          That's my first name.
	
	                    KARL
	          He's a-carryin' me to look fer work
	          in Millsburg where I was borned.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE
	          Would you like some coffee?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Coffee makes me a might nervous
	          when I drink it.
	
	                    DAUGHTER 
	          Daddy, can I be excused to go to
	          bed?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama
	          tonight. I'll sleep with your
	          brother and Karl can take your
	          room.
	
	                    DAUGHTER
	          Why?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          We have company. Now you go on.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	It's an all-American girls room. Everything is pink. There
	are stuffed animals everywhere and posters of pop idols.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, Karl, there's plenty of
	          blankets and things there.
	          Bathroom's right there in the hall.
	          We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
	
	Karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books.
	Woolridge closes the door.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Woolridge walks into the kitchen where Mom and Son sit at the
	table.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE 
	          Jerry, why didn't you give him
	          Bubba's room? Sister's is kind of
	          girly, isn't it?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Yeah, I thought about that. No
	          sense in moving him now I guess.
	
	                    BUBBA 
	          Daddy, don't you think one of us
	          ought to stay up all night and kind
	          of - guard or somethin'?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Why, hell no, son. What's wrong
	          with you?
	
	                    BUBBA 
	          Well, he's crazy. He's a nut ain't
	          he?
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE 
	          'Isn't' he, Bubba. Don't say ain't.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE DEN AND HALLWAY - MORNING
	
	Woolridge, already dressed, walks through the den and down
	the hallway. He knocks on the bedroom door.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Karl, you up?
	
	                    KARL (O.S.) 
	          Yes sir.
	
	Woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the
	edge of the bed beside his books. The light is on, the bed
	still as it was the night before.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Didn't you go to sleep at all,
	          Karl? You been sittin' there like
	          that all night?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, I guess we better hit the
	          road.
	
	INT. FIXIT SHOP - DAY
	
	Woolridge's car pulls into the parking lot. He and Karl get
	out and walk toward the shop.
	
	INT. FIXIT SHOP - DAY
	
	Two men, BILL COX, a large man in his forties, and SCOOTER
	HODGES, a really country-looking guy in his thirties, look up
	from behind the counter as Woolridge and Karl enter.
	Woolridge goes to the counter, Karl stands by the door
	looking at the floor.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to
	          see you. Been a long time.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Good to see you, Bill. How's
	          everybody doin'?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin'
	          me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put
	          me in the poorhouse. Can't complain
	          other than that. Wouldn't do any
	          good if I did. 
	              (laughs)
	          Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          No, don't guess I do. 
	              (he shakes hands with
	               Scooter who sort of
	               smiles)
	          Scooter, good to meet you. 
	              (Woolridge leans in and
	               gets confidential)
	          This is him, the one I talked to
	          you about on the phone. Now like I
	          said, I'll understand if you get
	          nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie
	          to you now, he did get in that
	          trouble but then he was real young.
	
	                    BILL 
	          I remember it real well. Cut them
	          folks to pieces. His mama one of
	          'em.
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I
	          always wanted to kill him myself.
	          Asshole's what he was. I remember
	          that ol' boy 
	              (points to Karl)
	          too. Kind of retarded or somethin'
	          back in school.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted
	          these days. I don't think he'd ever
	          hurt anybody.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Don't look much like he could. You
	          say he can fix a small engine like
	          nobody's bidness.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He's a regular whiz at it. That's
	          all he did when he was a kid.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, I ain't scared of him workin'
	          here. You know me. I'm a church
	          goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your
	          time's up the Lord's gonna come git
	          you. You seared of him, Scooter?
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          I don't guess. Can he talk?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate
	          it. He needs the job. I don't know
	          what to do with him. He don't have
	          anybody really.
	
	                    BILL 
	          That old man of his still livin'
	          over there on Clark Street I
	          believe.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He won't have anything to do with
	          him. Now you say it's all right for
	          him to stay out here in the back?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Fine with me. If he steals
	          anything, I'll take it out of your
	          pocket anyway.
	
	Bill slaps Woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with
	laughter.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He won't steal. I'm tellin' you
	          he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps
	          to himself.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, I've got a roomful of work
	          for him to do. Can't get Scooter to
	          do any of it.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Karl, come over here. I want you to
	          meet your new boss. 
	              (Karl obediently shuffles
	               over)
	          This is Bill Cox, runs this place.
	          Says you can work here and stay in
	          the back.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Good to know you, Karl.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Now it's minimal wage and there
	          ain't nothin' but a army cot and a
	          toilet back there.
	
	Karl doesn't say anything.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to
	          the car and get your books.
	
	Woolridge exits. Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl
	stares at the floor.
	
	                    BILL 
	          They say you're a whiz on fixin'
	          lawn mowers and things.
	
	                    KARL
	          I've tinkered around on 'em a
	          little bit.
	
	                    BILL 
	          We order from Dairy Queen at
	          noontime usually. We can buy your
	          lunch till you get on your feet a
	          little.
	
	                    KARL
	          I like them french-fried potaters.
	
	                    BILL 
	              (long pause)
	          Yeah, me too.
	
	                    SCOOTER
	          They make a good double meat
	          burger.
	
	INT. SHOP WORKROOM - NIGHT
	
	The place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed-eaters, and
	other equipment, most of it in pieces. A small cot is in a
	little clearing in the corner by the bathroom. Karl is
	sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while Scooter
	puts some tools away. Bill comes to the door.
	
	                    BILL
	          All right then, I'll see y'all
	          later. Karl you done a good day's
	          work. They right about you.
	          Scooter, he's gonna knock you out
	          of a job if you're not careful.
	          I'll see you tomorrow.
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          Wait up, I'll leave with you and
	          lock up.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Karl, they's a blanket up in under
	          that cot and soap in the bathroom
	          to clean up with. 
	              (pause)
	          Now there's one more thing. The way
	          we lock these doors at night, you
	          can't get out. You didn't want to
	          go anywhere, did you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon.
	
	                    BILL 
	          If it works out and all, maybe
	          we'll get you a key so you can get
	          out at night if you need to. See
	          you later.
	
	They leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. He
	sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. After a
	moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.
	
	INT. SHOP - DAY
	
	It's lunch time and Bill, Scooter, and Karl are sitting in
	folding chairs behind the counter eating from their Dairy
	Queen to-go bags. Karl has french fries.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Scooter, did I tell about the two
	          old boys pissin' off the bridge?
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          I can't remember.
	
	                    BILL 
	          There was these two old boys hung
	          their peckers off of a bridge to
	          piss, one old boy from California
	          and one old boy from Arkansas.
	          Old boy from California says, "Boy
	          this water's cold." Old boy from
	          Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep
	          too." 
	              (starts wheezing)
	          Get it? That's a goodun.
	
	                    SCOOTER
	              (laughing)
	          Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe
	          you did tell me that one before.
	          I've heard that a bunch. Long time
	          ago.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, yeah it's a classic. You
	          know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about
	          it last night and it's just not
	          Christian of me to not let you have
	          a key. I mean you been in lockup so
	          long, you don't need me keepin' you
	          locked up. You need to come and go
	          as you please. Here, take this key,
	          it'll get you in and out that back
	          door. 
	              (Karl takes the key and
	               keeps eating french
	               fries)
	          Them french fries good?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yeah, they's good all right.
	
	                    BILL 
	          You got any money?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They give me fifty dollars when
	          they turned me loose. I spent up
	          some of it on ridin' the bus and
	          eatin' french-fried potaters.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, I'm gonna pay you today for
	          this comin' week, so you'll have
	          some walkin' around money. When you
	          get off this evenin' you better go
	          buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up
	          supplies to have back there. Some
	          hard candy and some magazines.
	          Somethin' to keep you busy at
	          night.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	                    BILL 
	          I'll let you off while it's still
	          daylight.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Karl is walking down a residential street. He stops in front
	of the house where the boy, Frank, lives and stares at the
	house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares
	at it. A curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the
	window. He comes and opens the door.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Hey there. I thought I heard
	          somebody on the porch. Wasn't your
	          name Karl?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Yeah. What you doin' by here?
	
	                    KARL
	          You told me to come by.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Did you want to play ball with us?
	
	                    KARL
	          I ain't no good at it. I just come
	          by.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to
	          go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar
	          Store. She's workin' two till
	          eight.
	
	                    KARL
	          All right then.
	
	He starts to walk away.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Wait a minute. You want to go with
	          me? You can meet my mama.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't want to worry your mama
	          with company.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's
	          real nice. She'll give us somethin'
	          if we ask her to. Candy or
	          somethin'.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I was kindly needin' to do some
	          tradin'. Reckon they sell
	          toothpaste?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          They sell some of everything. Come
	          on let's go. I won't tell her about
	          you bein' in the state hospital for
	          killin'.
	
	INT. BEN'S DOLLAR STORE - DAY
	
	Frank and Karl make their way through the fairly crowded
	store. It's sort of a mini-version of a Walmart. They find
	Frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red
	Ben's knit shirt. They are laughing together and pricing some
	mouthwash. LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her
	thirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties,
	with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging
	over his belt. They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys
	approach.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Let me guess. You want a bunch of
	          candy and a pop.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          You're gonna rot your teeth that
	          way. But I bet I know what you
	          would like even better.
	          I put potted meat on special, four
	          cans for a dollar and they're not
	          moving very well. I'd sure let a
	          few cans go for free to the right
	          boy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I don't like potted meat. Daddy
	          used to say it was made out of lips
	          and peckers and intestints.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank, don't talk that way. Who's
	          that strange lookin' man behind
	          you? Did he follow you in here?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Can I help you, sir?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the
	          laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama.
	          And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager.
	          He lets mama off any time she feels
	          like it 'cause they're best
	          friends.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Nice to meet you, Karl.
	
	                    KARL
	              (keeping his distance)
	          Pleased to know y'all.
	
	There's an uncomfortable silence.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank come back here with me for a
	          minute.
	
	She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I don't think I've ever seen you
	          before.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw, I don't believe you have. I
	          don't reckon I never been in here.
	          This store didn't used to be here.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          It's been here seventeen years. Did
	          you live here before or something?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I's horned and raised here up till
	          I's twelve year old.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          What brings you back?
	
	                    KARL 
	          What's that you say?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Why are you here now?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They turned me loose from the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Is that right? 
	              (pause)
	          Are you going to be staying here
	          long?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired
	          on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Do you have family here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Not really to speak of.
	
	Linda and Frank return from the back.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you
	          can stay with us. Out in the
	          garage. Our car won't fit in there
	          anyway. It's real neat.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank told me about your situation.
	          And Frank loves company. You know,
	          especially after his daddy passed
	          and all. There ain't no sense in
	          you stayin' in that old greasy
	          shop. 
	              (to Vaughan, hushed)
	          He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	              (hushed)
	          He just got out of the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (put out)
	          I know.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Can we get some candy and pops?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Sure, go ahead.
	
	They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little
	puzzled.
	
	                    VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
	          Are you sure it's safe to let him
	          around that guy?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank's just crazy about him. He
	          likes the way he talks. He helped
	          him carry home the clean laundry.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          He's been in the state hospital a
	          long time, something must be wrong
	          with him.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He's retarded's all. You know he's
	          always after a father figure and
	          Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one
	          with his mean ass.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          What about me?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I don't think he sees you as a guy
	          guy.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	              (wrinkles his brow)
	          Karl is a guy guy?
	
	EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
	
	Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying
	the spoils of their Ben's Dollar Store visit.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          This is what I call my secret place
	          'cause I come out here when I feel
	          like bein' by myself. I used to
	          come here with Karen Cross. She's
	          kind of like my girlfriend, or used
	          to be. She says she likes Jerry
	          Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her
	          back 'cause I love her. We used to
	          come here and hold hands and talk
	          and read books to each other with a
	          flashlight. She didn't want to have
	          anything to do with me in front of
	          other people 'cause I don't have
	          any money. Well, mama and me, I
	          mean. She seemed to like me a whole
	          lot when we were out here though.
	          She said she loved me, too. Out
	          here. Settin' right on that stump
	          you're on. See, her daddy's a
	          dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry
	          Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice
	          plant. Was your folks well off?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough
	          to scrape by on, I reckon.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          They still around, your folks?
	
	                    KARL 
	          My mother's dead. My daddy's
	          s'posed to be around still. He
	          don't want to have nothin' to do
	          with me though.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          How do you know?
	
	                    KARL 
	          He never did want to. I figure he
	          ain't changed his mind much.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          How did your mama die?
	
	                    KARL
	              (long pause)
	          You don't need to know all of that.
	          You're just a boy.
	          You need to think about good
	          thoughts while you're still a boy.
	          They'll be plenty of time for the
	          other.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I've had a lot of bad thoughts
	          since my daddy died. Sometimes I
	          wish I was still real little and he
	          was still here. My mama's real
	          good, but I wish I had both of 'em. 
	              (pause)
	          When we went to Memphis one time in
	          the car, it was rainin' so hard we
	          couldn't see the road. But I wadn't
	          scared because I thought as long as
	          daddy was drivin' nothin' could
	          happen to us. I feel that way about
	          mama now. 
	              (he looks at the ground
	               for a moment)
	          Mama has a boyfriend now. His name
	          is Doyle Hargraves. He works
	          construction so he makes a pretty
	          good livin'. He still don't help
	          mama out with any money though. He
	          ain't no good. He's mean to her. He
	          don't like me at all. Mama says
	          it's because he's jealous I belong
	          to my daddy instead of him. He
	          stays with us all night sometimes,
	          but he's got his own house.
	          Somebody told me it's so he can
	          still have other girlfriends. I
	          like it on the nights when he ain't
	          at our house. I'm not so nervous
	          then.
	
	                    KARL 
	          How come her to keep bein'
	          girlfriends and all with him if
	          he's mean to her?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          She says it's for the times when
	          he's good to her. She's lonely
	          since daddy died. She said
	          sometimes she don't know why. 
	              (pause)
	          He threatened to kill her if she
	          ever left him. My daddy would kill
	          him if he was here and somebody was
	          mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real
	          good to mama. Vaughan that you met.
	          But he's not able to do anything to
	          Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
	          funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
	          to go with men instead of women.
	          That makes him not to be able to
	          fight too good. He sure is nice
	          though. He's from St. Louis. People
	          who are queer can get along better
	          in a big town. He got transferred
	          here to work. But mama said the
	          real reason he left is 'cause his
	          daddy hated him. For bein' the way
	          he is. I wish he liked to go with
	          women. I'd rather him be mama's
	          boyfriend than Doyle.
	
	Pause as Frank looks at the ground again. He seems troubled.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Karl. 
	              (pause)
	          You know when I said daddy got hit
	          by a train.
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me
	          that.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It ain't the truth. He shot hisself
	          with a shotgun on purpose.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Why did he do that, reckon.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          'Cause he didn't have enough money
	          to take care of us the way he
	          wanted to. That's what the letter
	          said. He got laid off from work and
	          had to just work odd jobs. I
	          thought he took care of us fine. 
	              (pause)
	          Karl, did you really kill somebody?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yeah, I did.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Who did you kill?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Two people.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Were they bad people?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I thought they was.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Maybe they needed it.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I growed up and got taught it ain't
	          right to kill nobody.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It's okay if you're lookin' out for
	          yourself. If it's self-defense. Was
	          it self-defense?
	
	Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and
	doesn't answer.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          My daddy was good. I think too many
	          good people die. It ain't right.
	          That's what I think.
	
	INT. SHOP - DAY
	
	Karl is tying the strap around his books. His sack of
	toiletries is on the bed. Bill Cox comes in.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Now, Karl, you sure you want to go
	          stay with these folks? You're
	          welcome to keep on stayin here.
	          It's workin' out real good.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That boy wants me to.
	
	                    BILL 
	          All right then. I'll see you bright
	          and early. How you comin' along on
	          that garden tiller?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty
	          good.
	
	                    BILL 
	          You done fixed it? I'll be damned.
	          Scooter told me it couldn't be
	          fixed.
	          'Course Scooter's about as shitless
	          as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.
	          You done fixed it. I'll just be
	          damned. See you tomorrow.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	DOYLE is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle
	drinking beer. He's in his late thirties and dressed in his
	construction clothes. Linda sits on the arm of the chair and
	Frank stands before them.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, honey, I don't guess I give a
	          shit. I ain't here half the time
	          anyway. If you want a retard livin'
	          in the garage, I don't guess I
	          care. I've got a good tool box and
	          socket set out there I don't want
	          stol'd. I guess I could take it
	          home with me.
	
	                    FRANK
	          He's real honest. He wouldn't steal
	          nothin'.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you,
	          was I? 
	              (pause)
	          Was I?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          No sir.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your
	          mama. This is your mama's decision,
	          not yours. I'm lettin' it go on
	          because she asked me, not you. 
	              (to Linda)
	          Now is this the kind of retard that
	          drools and rubs shit in his hair
	          and all that, 'cause I have trouble
	          eatin' around that kind of thing.
	          Just like I am about antique
	          furniture and midgets. I can't so
	          much as drink a glass of water
	          around a midget or a piece of
	          antique furniture. Same thing with
	          a droolin' retard.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't
	          be that way.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just
	          tellin' the truth. What was he in
	          the nuthouse for?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He's just mentally retarded, I
	          guess.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          He had of went nuts and did
	          somethin'. They don't put you in
	          there for just bein' a retard.
	          They's retards all over the place
	          that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you
	          know, Frank?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I ain't sure.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You might want to find out. He
	          might of hacked his family to
	          pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Yeah, that's right, Frank, you
	          better ask him. I mean, don't hurt
	          his feelin's or anything, but it
	          would be good to know. I'm sure
	          it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You sure are hung up on people
	          bein' sweet. 
	              (takes a long pull on his
	               beer)
	          Speakin' of which, where's your
	          girlfriend? I thought he was comin'
	          by here for something.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He'll be here in a little while,
	          he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Ain't that the sweetest thing. What
	          am I supposed to do about supper
	          with you traipsin' around with that
	          fag?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You're not crippled. Get in there
	          and make somethin'.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Boy, ain't you somethin' else.
	          Talkin' back and everything. It
	          kinda makes me horny when you talk
	          back.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank, why don't you go off and
	          play in your room if Doyle's gonna
	          talk nasty.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I want to watch T.V.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V.
	          Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a
	          family till your retarded friend
	          and your homosexual friend gets
	          here.
	
	EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
	
	Karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books
	staring at the door. After a moment, we hear a car door slam
	and footsteps on the porch. Then we hear Vaughan's voice.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Karl?
	
	Karl turns to face Vaughan.
	
	                    KARL
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          So, you're really going to stay
	          here?
	
	                    KARL
	          That boy wants me to.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Did you knock on the door yet?
	
	                    KARL
	          Naw, I ain't.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          How long have you been standing
	          here?
	
	                    KARL
	          Quite a spell, I reckon.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Listen, before you get very used to
	          staying here, I think you and I
	          need to talk about a few things.
	          Can I take you to lunch?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I done et just a little bit ago.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I mean tomorrow or the next day.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I can stand to eat a
	          little somethin' or 'nother at
	          noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox
	          generally gets me a box of french
	          fried potaters. But I reckon he can
	          lay off doin' it tomorrow.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and
	          get you at noon.
	
	They stand therefor a moment. Vaughan doesn't really know
	exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After a
	moment, Frank answers the door.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Hey. Y'all come on in.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Vaughan ushers Karl in and they stand behind the sofa. Doyle
	looks up and grins.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Tolerable, I reckon.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (in a hurry to get out)
	          Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.
	          Frank, why don't you and Karl go
	          out in the garage and fix him up a
	          place or play a game or somethin'.
	          Vaughan, you ready to go?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Sure, I guess.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Don't rush ever'body, honey.
	
	She starts to get her things together.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (to Frank)
	          Maybe you and Karl want to go with
	          us?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl
	          got things we need to do.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Hey, Vaughan, you know what I
	          heard? I heard you been puttin' it
	          to Albert Sellers that works over
	          at the funeral home.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I know Albert. We're friends.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I heard you was more than friends.
	          I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all
	          all bowed up and goin' at it in the
	          same room with poor, little, old
	          Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a
	          doornail layed out on a gurney.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          That's ridiculous. That's just a
	          total lie.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Let's go, Vaughan. 
	              (they start for the door)
	          Frank, we'll be back in a little
	          while. I'll bring you back
	          somethin'. You're food's in the
	          oven warmin' over.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          See, you made him somethin'. Hey
	          Vaughan, I was just goin' on with
	          you, jokin' around, buddy.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	              (smiles a little)
	          Yeah, I knew that. You're a card
	          all right.
	
	Linda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to
	          me.
	
	Karl sits on the couch.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Come on, Karl, let's go out to the
	          garage.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man.
	          You set right there, Karl.
	
	Frank leans on the sofa arm beside Karl.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          What's in your bag?
	
	                    KARL
	          This and that. Toothpaste and
	          whatnot.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          What's all them books?
	
	                    KARL
	          Different ones. The Bible's one of
	          'em.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          You believe in the Bible?
	
	                    KARL
	          A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't
	          understand all of it.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, I can't understand none of
	          it. This one begat this one and
	          that one begat this one and begat
	          and begat and begat and lo somebody
	          sayeth some shit or another. Just
	          how retarded are you?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Stop it, Doyle!
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'.
	          The adults are talkin'. Were you in
	          the lockup for cuttin' somebody up
	          with a hatchet?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't never used no hatchet that
	          I remember.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You're just crazy in a retarded
	          kind of way then. 
	              (pause)
	          It wouldn't matter to me if you did
	          do violence on somebody 'cause I
	          ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm
	          afraid for you to stay here. You're
	          just a humped over retard it looks
	          like to me. Not really, I'm just
	          jokin' with you. Welcome to our
	          humble home, buddy. Frank needs all
	          the friends he can get. Frank's a
	          real weak little kid. His daddy
	          taught him how to be a pussy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about
	          daddy, you hear me!
	
	                    DOYLE 
	              (mocking)
	          Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on
	          to the garage and let me be.
	
	Frank is crying now.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Come on, Karl.
	
	They get up and walk away.
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (yelling to Frank)
	          Don't tell your mama we had a
	          little spat. She don't need to be
	          worried with your ass.
	
	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
	
	Karl sits on an old sofa and Frank sits on an upside down
	paint bucket, still upset.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I'd like to kill that son of a
	          bitch. I hate him.
	
	                    KARL
	          You ort not to talk that way.
	          You're just a boy.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Well, I hate him.
	
	                    KARL
	          He ort not to talk that away to you
	          neither. He ain't no count. He's
	          mean to you and your mama. 
	              (pause)
	          Yore mama and that feller that's
	          carryin' me to get somethin'
	          d'eat's gonna be back here
	          directly.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Will you stay here with us for a
	          long time?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon if you want me to. 
	              (pause)
	          I got some of that potted meat and
	          sodie crackers left over if you
	          want some.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I don't see how you can eat that
	          stuff with all those insides it's
	          made out of.
	
	                    KARL
	          I reckon it tastes pretty good to
	          me.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I like the way you talk.
	
	                    KARL
	          I like the way you talk.
	
	Karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight
	as we:
	
	                                        DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. HAMBURGER ESTABLISHMENT - DAY
	
	Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a
	table and they sit and immediately start to eat. After a few
	bites, Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Okay, Karl, the reason I brought
	          you here was to talk to you about
	          something that is on my mind. 
	              (pauses for a response,
	               instead Karl eats french
	               fries and stares at the
	               table)
	          I guess I'll put it right out on
	          the table. Where do I start. Linda
	          and Frank are very important to me.
	          They're like family. My own family
	          was never like family. They're
	          horrible people. As a matter of
	          fact I prayed every night for years
	          that my father would die. I finally
	          realized through a lot of therapy
	          that I was wasting my energy on
	          hating him. Now I just don't care. 
	              (pause)
	          You see, you and I are a lot alike,
	          strange as that may seem. I mean
	          not physically or even mentally
	          really, just well, maybe
	          emotionally or actually the hand
	          we've been dealt in life. We're
	          different. People see us as being
	          different anyway. You're -- well
	          you have your affliction or
	          whatever and I, well mine's not as
	          easy to see. I'm just going to say
	          it. I'm gay. 
	              (watts)
	          Does that surprise you? 
	              (watts)
	          That I'm gay. You know what being
	          gay is, don't you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon not.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Well that's a very offensive way to
	          put it. You shouldn't say that. You
	          were taught that, weren't you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I've heard it said that way.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Anyway, it's hard to live gay,
	          that's the right way to say it, in
	          a small town like this. I've wanted
	          to leave many times, but my love
	          for Linda and Frank and another
	          certain person that we won't go
	          into have kept me from it. Anyway,
	          I'm rambling. If you're going to
	          live in the Wheatly garage you need
	          to know that it won't be easy.
	          Doyle is a monster. Not just a
	          closed minded redneck, but a
	          monster. A dangerous person. I've
	          told Linda that one day that man is
	          going to really hurt her or that
	          boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
	          see it in his eyes. I'm very in
	          tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
	          will make your life hell. You're a
	          perfect target. When I first saw
	          you I was afraid of you. Not really
	          afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
	          But also, I felt a real sensitive
	          feeling from you. And for some
	          reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
	          like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
	          didn't mean it like that. In a good
	          way. Anyway, I just want you to
	          know what you're in for. I have a
	          good feeling about you. You're good
	          for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
	          have an adult friend on a child's
	          level.
	          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a
	          bad way.
	              (pause)
	          There's one more thing. It's none
	          of my business why you were in the
	          state hospital. Everyone has
	          something in their past, maybe you
	          tried suicide, maybe you did
	          something -- terrible. But what I
	          see before me is a gentle, simple
	          man. All I want you to promise me
	          is that you're capable of being
	          around Linda and Frank. You know.
	          You would never hurt them under any
	          circumstances, would you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I wouldn't never hurt them.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          That's what I thought. I hope I
	          haven't offended you in any way.
	          You seem like a thinker. You seem
	          to always be in deep thought. Tell
	          me something. What are you thinking
	          right now?
	
	Karl looks up and stares for a moment.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I was thinkin' I could use me
	          another helpin' of these potaters.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Oh. How about before that?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Before that I was thinkin' it'd be
	          good if I could get another three
	          or four cans of that potted meat if
	          you got any extry.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Linda, Frank, and Doyle are eating.
	
	                    LINDA
	          How come Karl won't eat here with
	          us?
	
	                    FRANK
	          I don't know. He just said he'd eat
	          out there.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
	
	                    LINDA
	          I just feel sorry for the poor
	          thing.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Who could eat with him settin'
	          there makin' that goddamn racket
	          with his throat.
	
	                    LINDA
	          He does make some funny noises.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I sure like the way he talks. It
	          sounds like a race car motor
	          idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
	
	                    LINDA
	          I'm glad of it, honey.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          What have you got to be nervous
	          about? You're a damn kid. You ain't
	          got any bills to pay or bidness to
	          run or old lady to stay on your ass
	          all the time.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I get nervous, that's all I know.
	
	They eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where
	this conversation could lead and know when to leave well
	enough alone.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know what, by God?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          What?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know what we ought to do
	          tonight?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Please Doyle, don't.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Have a damn party! Call Morris and
	          them and get the band together and
	          just party our asses off. I'd like
	          to show that fuckin' Karl to the
	          guys. They'd get a kick out of
	          that. Don't you know they would.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not
	          up for it. They always stay till
	          mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You don't have to do anything but
	          pour some potato chips in a bowl
	          and bring beers out when we get
	          low.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Last time you got mad and run
	          Morris and them off and said to
	          stay away from here.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          That ain't none of your damn
	          bidness. Besides that's the way
	          friends do one another. Fuck it,
	          I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find
	          my guitar, I think it's out there
	          in the garage with that loony tune.
	
	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
	
	Karl sits on his cot eating from the plate Frank brought him.
	Frank and Linda come through the door. Frank comes and sits
	beside Karl. Linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and
	comes over and stands in front of Karl.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Karl, now listen, there's gonna be
	          a party tonight here at the house.
	          Doyle's invited his music-playin'
	          buddies over to make a bunch of
	          racket out on the patio.
	
	                    FRANK
	          They ain't even no good. The only
	          one can play is Randy
	          Horsefeathers. He claims he's an
	          Indian. His real name's Randy
	          Collins and he works at the feed
	          mill. He can at least play guitar.
	
	                    LINDA
	          He's no more an Indian than I am
	          though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try
	          and tease you and be mean to you to
	          show off to his friends. Just like
	          he does to Frank and me sometimes.
	          You just ignore it. Or stay out
	          here away from 'em if he'll let
	          you. He's an okay guy till he gets
	          drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
	          I guarantee it.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          He ain't ever okay to me.
	
	The garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really
	happy.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, it's on! We're gonna rock.
	          Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to
	          get over here. I'd like him to be
	          here. I owe him a good time.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to
	          come to a party with you.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done
	          called him. He'll be here. 
	              (grins)
	          Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I
	          need you to help me ice down a tub
	          of beer, you and Frank.
	
	INT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
	
	White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. Karl
	sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground
	alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda. The "band" is set up on
	the patio. The band consists of MORRIS, a heavyset guy in a
	military uniform on tambourine, TERENCE, a skinny guy in a
	wheelchair on bass, RANDY, a long haired younger guy who's
	not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't
	play and MONTY "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a ZZ
	Top beard on drums. A tub of beer is in front of them.
	They're all hooting and hollering and drinking. They've
	obviously been at it for a while. Doyle steps forward to
	address the 'crowd.'
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Okay ladies and gentlemen 
	              (points to Vaughan)
	          or both. It's come to the time in
	          our show when we like to introduce
	          the band. Over here on lead guitar
	          Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on
	          hit a hot lick, Randy. 
	              (Randy plays a lick)
	          Well, come on, y'all are supposed
	          to clap now. Come on! 
	              (they clap a little except
	               for Karl)
	
	ANGLE ON LINDA
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Karl, you better clap your hands or
	          he'll just keep on.
	
	Karl claps his hands a little.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          On the bass, give it up for Terence
	          "One Ball" Atkins. 
	              (more half-assed clapping)
	          On the tambourine and lyrics Morris
	          Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the
	          group. 
	              (claps)
	          On drums "The Johnson." 
	              (claps)
	          And last and most importantly,
	          Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar
	          and business affairs and the only
	          motherfucker with a truck big
	          enough to haul this outfit on the
	          next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a
	          big hand for these guys. They're
	          workin' their asses off here. 
	              (pauses for a slug of
	               beer)
	          Okay I'd like to dedicate this next
	          one to some very special people in
	          our audience tonight. To my lovely
	          female companion Linda, her lovely
	          son Frank, our new boarder Karl -
	          what's your last name Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Childers.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Karl Childers just in from the
	          state facility. Make one of them
	          gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it
	          is you do. 
	              (nothing)
	          Oh well, Karl's a little retarded,
	          he don't know what the hell I'm
	          talkin' about. And to Vaughan who
	          fucks a mortician in the rear
	          entrance right in front of his
	          clients. Now that takes balls. Our
	          number one tune for the folks,
	          boys. Kick it off Johnson!
	
	They play "Walk Don't Run" while the audience of four sits in
	motionless silence. They finish the song and hoot and holler
	and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          You like that Vaughan?
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Sure. It sounded like a number one
	          tune all right.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You enjoying yourself, Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	We hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near
	distance.
	
	                    VOICE (O.S.) 
	          I wished you all would lay off for
	          tonight. I can't hear myself think
	          for that racket. It's nighttime,
	          now let folks be! I'll call the
	          law!
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (hollers back)
	          I told you already three times, the
	          laws on my side. I play cards with
	          J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police.
	          Get fucked you old bastard! 
	              (to the party)
	          Okay now, Linda, you and the kid
	          clean up and get a tarpaulin over
	          this instruments. Me and the boys
	          are goin' to the county line.
	          We're out of liquor and beer. Come
	          on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin'
	          with us.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I'd better go on home now, it's
	          late. I have to work tomorrow.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Come on, don't be a pussy.
	          Everybody has to work.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He don't want to Doyle. Don't go
	          Vaughan if you don't want to.
	          You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (very sincere)
	          But honey, I'll be good. I promise.
	          I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin'
	          to help these two be part of
	          things.
	
	INT. DOYLE'S TRUCK - NIGHT
	
	Doyle is driving, Vaughan in the middle, and Karl by the
	window. Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
	tape. The first few notes of "Ghost Riders in the Sky" play.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Are you sure you can drive? You've
	          really had a lot of alcohol.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
	
	They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song
	goes louder.
	
	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
	
	The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the
	"band" in the back of the truck trying to control Terence's
	wheelchair as it rolls back and forth.
	
	INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (points to tape player)
	          Not that you afflicted sons of
	          bitches would know anything about
	          it, but this is art.
	
	They are stopped by a red traffic light. A police car pulls
	up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on
	the passenger side and turns down the music.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I
	          seen your pitcher in the paper for
	          catchin' that big-ass bass.
	
	                    FREDDY 
	          Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't
	          drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FREDDY 
	          I figured that. Well you better be
	          careful with that cripple in the
	          back. You'll throw him out. Looks
	          like you got a wagonful.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          We run outta somethin' to drink.
	          Goin' to the county line. You want
	          to race?
	
	                    FREDDY
	              (laughing)
	          You know better than that. We're on
	          duty. Catch me in that Camaro next
	          week one night.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Catch you later Freddy!
	
	Doyle peels out and the music blares again.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          I bet you like sittin' between two
	          men in a dual wheel truck don't
	          you?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Sarcastic right? 
	              (pause)
	          You know the boys in the band are
	          probably gonna stay over tonight.
	          We'd be glad to have you.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
	Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
	are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
	room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really
	stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
	strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue,
	which has obviously been going on for awhile.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow
	          me on those particular points, but
	          it's not really important in the
	          smaller picture, which is where
	          most people dwell anyway. Not that
	          being manager of Ben's Dollar Store
	          is insignificant. Or that making it
	          through years of incarceration in a
	          state supported facility is any
	          small feat.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          Morris, he's the only one in the
	          band that went to college.
	
	                    RANDY
	          I'm in junior college right now
	          over in Westfield.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          That ain't no college, that's trade
	          school. Auto repair ain't ever made
	          a genius out of nobody.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Holidays are for campers.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          What do you know about bein' a
	          genius, Johnson. You can't even
	          hardly keep a steady beat on that
	          high-price drum set.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          I think y'all play really tight
	          together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't
	          throw off on one another.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Anything that has to be discussed
	          can't mean anything.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You got that shit right.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          What exactly do you mean by that? I
	          don't understand.
	
	                    MORRIS
	          Exactly the point, my young
	          levelheaded friend.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I don't get it.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          I rest my case.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          Morris is real smart with
	          philosophies and things. That's why
	          him and me are the songwriting team
	          of our group. I make up good tunes
	          or melodies as we call them and
	          Morris is the lyrics.
	
	                    MORRIS
	          Not unlike Gary Brooker of the
	          Protocol Harum.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          We don't ever play any songs that
	          y'all wrote. I never even heard one
	          of 'em. Y'all just talk.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          We don't even play any songs with
	          words at all that I remember. We
	          ain't got no fuckin' microphone. Or
	          speaker set up.
	
	                    TERENCE
	          We wrote one last night standin'
	          outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it
	          "Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."
	          Then, you know, like on country
	          songs in parenthesis it says "There
	          is usually someone in the trunk." I
	          came up with a tune just humming.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          See Vaughan, you shouldn't question
	          a genius. Morris is a modern day
	          poet like in the old days.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Our latest composition is as
	          follows: entitled: 
	          "The Thrill" --
	          "I stand on the hill 
	          Not for a thrill 
	          but for a breath 
	          of a fresh kill 
	          Never mind the man 
	          who contemplates 
	          doing away with license plates 
	          He stands alone anyway 
	          Baking the cookies of discontent 
	          By the heat of a laundrymat vent
	          Leaving his soul" 
	          (Then like in poetry I have dot dot
	          dot then drop down to the next line
	          kind of off center.)
	          "Leaving his soul parting waters
	          Under the medulla oblongata 
	          of (then dot dot dot again)
	          mankind."
	
	Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
	something other than Morris.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          I don't think that's right. I
	          believe dot dot dot come between
	          medulla and oblongata or something
	          like that. 
	              (Morris stares at him)
	          Well it did. It wadn't before
	          mankind, I know that much.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          The dots are where I say they are.
	          Melody and tune. That's your trade.
	          You're a tunesmith Terence.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          I don't really understand the
	          meaning of the words.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go
	          out of my mind. And plus you're
	          liable to bust a spring in Karl's
	          head. He's already off balance.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          That wadn't the way you made it up
	          before, Morris. That's all I know.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          We don't need fancy words, we need
	          to practice. We don't ever
	          rehearse.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          We need some payin' gigs instead of
	          just messin' around on first one
	          patio and then another'n.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          Morris, you should just be the
	          manager, you can't play nothin'
	          anyway.
	
	Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
	window. He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
	madman in a flash.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all
	          just shut the fuck up! We don't
	          need no practicin' or managers
	          cause we ain't no fuckin' band!
	          Morris ain't no genius and the rest
	          of you are just losers. Am I the
	          only one sane human bein' around
	          here? Just get the hell out of my
	          house and don't come back!
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          It's not your house, Doyle, it's
	          Linda's.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!
	          You mind your own business. Now get
	          out! Now, before I get too mad to
	          turn back.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          What about our instruments?
	
	Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes
	him right out the screen door. We hear the chair clatter down
	the steps and a cry of pain from Terence.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Now!
	
	They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit
	frozen on the sofa.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON
	              (turning back)
	          You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's
	          wrong with you. Nobody needs your
	          shit.
	
	                    MORRIS
	              (stops at the door)
	          The dots just look good on paper.
	          You don't sing 'em anyway. You're
	          showing your true Aries colors now.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Get out of my goddamn face, you
	          fuckin' buzzard!
	
	He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the
	sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in
	the doorway.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          I thought I told everybody to get
	          out of my house. That includes
	          cocksuckers and retards. Get off
	          your asses and go.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          This is not your house, Doyle. This
	          is my house and I'll say who stays
	          and goes. You've got a house, why
	          don't you go get one of your
	          girlfriends and go home to it.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know better than to talk like
	          that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make
	          me knock the piss out of you.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Doyle, don't you lay one hand on
	          her.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          That's funny. 
	              (to Linda)
	          You go to bed and take snot nose
	          with you.
	
	Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets
	up also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You're not stayin' here tonight. Go
	          get sober before you come back. I'm
	          tired of my child seein' this. Now
	          you get yourself straight or I'll
	          lock your ass out of my life for
	          good.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know what I told you, you even
	          think of leavin' me, I'll kill you
	          dead as a doornail.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          That might be better than this.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          I'm a witness. I heard you threaten
	          her life.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          I thought I told you to keep out!
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (an inch from her face)
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
	face. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes
	wild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty
	cans, bottles, a lampstand.
	He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to
	the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost
	pitiful.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
	          Everything's botherin' me, that's
	          all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I hate you!
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, I hate you, too. No I don't.
	          I love your mama. Nobody
	          understands what I go through. I'll
	          leave. You bunch of freaks have
	          fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey.
	          I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass,
	          really. 
	              (to Frank)
	          You ever hit me again you little
	          bastard and I'll make you sorry
	          your daddy ever squirted your
	          little ass out.
	
	He leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as
	does Vaughan.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You all right, Mama?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and
	          forget about tonight.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We don't need to think bad
	          thoughts, do we Mama?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          No, honey, we don't. 
	              (pause)
	          I'll make some coffee and start
	          cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you
	          want some coffee, huh?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me
	          nervous when I drink it.
	
	                                        DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Linda cleaning up the last of the mess. Frank comes in sleepy
	eyed in his pajamas.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          What are you doin' up again, Frank?
	          You need to get a little sleep.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Did Vaughan go home?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Yeah, he has to go to work in a
	          little while. I do too.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Did Karl go to bed?
	
	                    LINDA
	          I guess. He went to the garage.
	          Poor thing, he's probably never
	          seen such a crazy mess. He probably
	          wants to go back and live in Mr.
	          Cox's shop.  
	
	                    FRANK
	          I bet he don't. Karl likes me. 
	
	                    LINDA
	          I know he does.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Mama?
	
	                    LINDA
	          Huh?
	
	                    FRANK
	          Is everything gonna be all right
	          someday? I just stay nervous all
	          the time just about. 
	
	                    LINDA
	          Yeah, honey, someday everything's
	          gonna be all right.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Doyle wouldn't really kill you,
	          would he?
	
	                    LINDA
	          I promise we're gonna get away from
	          him. The time has to be right,
	          that's all. I'd rather him get
	          tired of me and leave me. Then he
	          wouldn't want to hurt me. He
	          wouldn't care then. We'll be fine.
	          I promise. You go to bed now. 
	              (she hugs him)
	          I love you.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I love you, too, Mama.
	
	He goes to his room.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and
	sits at the table. After a moment, she looks up and is
	startled to see Karl in the doorway.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You scared me.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I didn't aim to.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Want to sit down? Did you need
	          somethin'?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No ma'am.
	
	Karl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          Two fellers was on a bridge a
	          takin' a leak and one feller says
	          the water was cold and the other
	          said it was deep water. One of 'em
	          came from Arkansas, I believe.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (puzzled)
	          I'll be dog.
	
	More silence.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Do you reckon you can make me some
	          biscuits?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Right now?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Just whenever you take a notion to.
	          I don't aim to put you out.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well, it is nearly breakfast time
	          anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have
	          to be at work in three hours. You
	          know how it is when you just sleep
	          an hour or two, you feel worse than
	          if you hadn't slept at all?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well, set down and I'll make some
	          biscuits and gravy.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Mustard's good on 'em to me.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Okay.
	
	Karl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          It's all right. 
	              (pause)
	          You know I was thinkin' there's
	          this girl that works with me. She's
	          real heavy, but she's cute in the
	          face. Well, you know, she's slow.
	          She's a little bit, I think. She's
	          not retarded, just -- it don't
	          matter, listen to me. I thought you
	          might like to meet her. Vaughan
	          wants to have a little supper over
	          at his house and we could invite
	          her. Would you like that?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Vaughan's "friend" will be there,
	          too. He works at the funeral home.
	          And Frank. You know Frank likes you
	          a lot. He says you make him feel
	          calm.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me
	          and him's made friends.
	
	She keeps working.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          Hit ain't right for me to keep from
	          tellin' you how come me to be put
	          in the state hospital.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          That's okay. It's not really my
	          business. I have wondered though.
	          Why was it? Was it like a nervous
	          breakdown?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I killed my mother and a old boy
	          name Jesse Dixon. I thought they
	          was a-doin' wrong. I was about your
	          boy's age. They say I'm well now
	          from it.
	
	Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but
	not as much as you would think.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Was that you? I remember that. I
	          was only three or four, but I
	          always heard about it growin' up. 
	              (pause)
	          They say you're well?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am. 
	              (pause)
	          I like your garage. 
	              (pause)
	          I wouldn't never hurt you or your
	          boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible
	          and say the same thing.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I believe you. I really do.
	
	EXT. COVS PARKING LOT - DAY
	
	Bill Cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man.
	Bill is trying to crank it up, but it won't start. A car
	pulls into the parking lot and Gerry Woolridge gets out of it
	and comes over to Bill.
	
	                    BILL 
	          How 'bout you, Jerry.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          How are you, Bill?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Doin' pretty good. Got a sick
	          tiller here. What's got you down
	          this way?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Just thought I'd check on Karl and
	          see if everything's working out.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for
	          them rackets and breathin' things
	          he does. Ain't threatened me with a
	          killin' or anything. 
	              (laughs)
	          But boy you couldn't of been more
	          right about him fixin' things. That
	          son of a bitch is a regular Eli
	          Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves
	          french fries. Eats four larges and
	          don't even so much as belch. I'm
	          proud to have him.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Is him stayin' here workin' out?
	
	                    BILL 
	          He's gone to stayin' over with that
	          Wheatley boy and his mama in their
	          garage. I think that little boy
	          adopted him damn near like a
	          mascot. But he's got a key here to
	          come and go as he pleases.
	          Everything's worked out good.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Can I see him?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Sure.
	
	Bill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on
	new mowers in the front window.
	
	                    BILL (CONT'D)
	          Scooter! Run get Karl for me.
	
	EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
	
	Woolridge and Karl lean on the hood of Woolridge's car. In
	the background, Bill and the old man tinker with the tiller.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Are you sure you're okay staying
	          with that woman and boy?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Do they know about you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          My history.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I told 'em about it. They know I'm
	          well. That Mizz Wheatley made me
	          some biscuits.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I'll be.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That boy, he's my friend. He likes
	          the way I talk and I like the way
	          he talks.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I knew you'd do all right. Well, I
	          just wanted to check on you. I'll
	          say bye to Bill and get on back.
	
	They walk over to Bill.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Karl, see if you can figure out
	          what's wrong with this thing. It
	          won't crank up and ever'thing seems
	          to be put together right.
	
	Karl squats beside the tiller.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I'll see you, Bill.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Okay, stop back by. Don't worry
	          about your boy here, he's doin'
	          good.
	
	Karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Hit ain't got no gas in it.
	
	                    BILL 
	          See there. Thinks of the simplest
	          thing first.
	
	INT. VAUGHAN'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Vaughan, ALBERT the "friend," Linda, Frank, Karl, and
	MELINDA, the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table. Karl
	and Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly
	picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat.
	This goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns
	to Karl.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          So Karl, do you intend to stay in
	          the lawnmower business for a while
	          or do you have other plans?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I think Karl is going to be a
	          writer or a librarian eventually.
	          You should see all the books he
	          has. He must read constantly.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't read 'em yet except two or
	          three of 'em. I can't understand a
	          lot of what I try to read. My mind,
	          hit wonders off to somethin' else
	          when I try to read.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          I'm the same way. Of course, in my
	          line of work, I stay too busy to
	          read.
	          But at least I have job security.
	          People may stop doing a lot of
	          things, but one thing is for sure,
	          they won't stop dying.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (looks at Frank)
	          Why don't we talk about something a
	          little more festive.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Does everyone like the food?
	
	Nods and yeses.
	
	                    VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
	          Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm
	          a good cook.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda
	          was voted employee of the month at
	          the Dollar Store last February.
	          Isn't that somethin'?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am, I reckon.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Well, when you like pricing items
	          as much as I do, I guess it's just
	          bound to happen sooner or later.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Karl, maybe you and Melinda might
	          want to take a walk or something
	          after dinner. It's a nice night.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Vaughan, don't get pushy.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                    KARL
	          I like walkin' quite a bit from
	          time to time.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          I stay on my feet all the time at
	          work. I just can't find shoes
	          that's comfortable.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          Hospital shoes might be the answer.
	          Nurses' shoes.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Or the kind old ladies who work in
	          the school cafeteria wear.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          Same difference.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          I get real mean when my feet hurt.
	          It's the only time I don't like
	          checkin' out the customers, when my
	          feet hurt.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin'
	          much, you boys must really like
	          that food.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I just don't have anything to say
	          about shoes.
	
	Silence for a moment.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Listen everybody, I know this may
	          sound corny, I've had a few glasses
	          of wine and that kind of makes me a
	          little emotional, but I'm going to
	          say it anyway. It just came over me
	          in a rush. I want you all to know
	          that I care about each and every
	          one of you at this table.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          That's very sweet of you Vaughan.
	          We care about you, too. Don't we
	          y'all?
	
	Nods, grunts, "Sure do's."
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Also, Melinda, please don't tell
	          anybody at the store that Albert
	          was here tonight, okay.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Why?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Well, a lot of people in town talk
	          and spread cruel rumors.
	          Unfortunately, I have to keep
	          certain parts of my life private.
	
	                    MELINDA
	          You mean about y'all bein' together
	          in "that" way?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Yes.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          I think everybody at the store
	          knows that already. They always
	          talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter
	          told a awful story about why you
	          ain't allowed over at the First
	          Baptist Church no more.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Karl, why don't you and Melinda go
	          take a walk. It's nice out.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	He gets up and walks toward the front door. Melinda gets up
	and tries to catch up.
	
	EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
	
	Karl and Melinda are walking in the moonlight. It seems a
	little hard for Melinda to keep up.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          You walk fast, don't you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	They walk a little farther in silence.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          These is the worst shoes I own for
	          walkin'. How far did you want to
	          go?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't really thought about it too
	          much I don't reckon.
	
	They walk until they disappear into the darkness.
	
	INT. COX'S SHOP - DAY
	
	Karl is on the floor working on a mower with Scooter, they
	are ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things. Bill Cox
	appears in the door.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Hey Karl, they's somebody out here
	          to see you. Some gal holding a nice
	          bouquet. 
	              (Karl doesn't move)
	          Come on now, she wants to talk to
	          you. Don't just set there.
	
	Karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter.
	Melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a
	cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. Nobody
	says anything for a moment.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These
	          was on sale 'cause they're not
	          fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus
	          my ten percent employee discount.
	          Since I didn't bring you anything
	          to our date last night, I thought
	          you'd like to have 'em.
	
	She hands them to him.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Scooter, let's me and you go over
	          to Dairy Queen and pick up a few
	          things for lunchtime.
	
	                    SCOOTER
	          I can go. You don't have to. You
	          don't never go.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon
	          my language, ma'am.
	
	They start to leave. At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at
	Karl. They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the
	counter. They are silent for a while.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Well, I just thought I'd give you
	          them. I liked walkin' with you. I
	          got a blister the size of a quarter
	          on one heel. Well, I'll see you
	          sometime, I guess.
	
	She walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say
	something.
	
	                    KARL 
	          A blister shore can hurt.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL
	          Flowers is pretty. I've always
	          thought that.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Me, too.
	
	She leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers
	and watches her walk away.
	
	EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK
	
	Holding the flowers, Karl is walking down the sidewalk toward
	the Wheatley house when he sees Frank coming out the front
	door with a book and a flashlight. He sees Karl.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Hey Karl, you off work?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Where'd you get them flowers?
	
	                    KARL
	          That gal that made employee of the
	          month give 'em to me for awalkin'
	          with her.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I was goin' to the secret place. I
	          borried one of your books to take
	          down there. You ain't mad, are you?
	
	                    KARL
	          Naw. You can look at all my books
	          you want to.
	
	                    FRANK
	          It's name's A Christmas Carol.
	
	                    KARL
	          That's than un on Christmas I was
	          tellin' you about.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You want to go with me?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	EXT. SECRET PLACE - NIGHT
	
	Karl and Frank sit in the clearing, Karl on the stump, Frank
	on the ground. Frank is shining the flashlight on the book.
	He finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a
	          while.
	
	                    KARL
	          All right then.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Boy, folks sure had it rough back a
	          long time ago, didn't they?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like
	          to tore me up when I read about
	          that pore little cripple boy.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Yeah, me too. 
	              (pause)
	          That was nice of that woman to give
	          you them flowers.
	
	                    KARL
	          Hit was right thoughty of her.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You know that girl I told you
	          about. The one I love.
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah, I recollect it.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Would you go see her with me? I
	          kind of thought I might take her
	          some flowers like that woman done
	          you.
	
	                    KARL
	          If you want me to.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I ain't got no money to get 'em
	          with but I bet Vaughan will let me
	          have some of them flowers at the
	          store.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I bet he will. I got a little money
	          if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I usually get run off by her mama
	          or daddy if they're home. Reckon
	          why they don't like me?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They ort to. You're a good boy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean
	          I don't love her.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          And I don't try to touch her. You
	          know, in a bad way. Foolin' around,
	          sex and all.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That's real good. You ort not to if
	          ye ain't married to somebody. Bible
	          tells you that much. Hit tells some
	          things that don't seem right too, I
	          reckon. I guess a feller ort to
	          foller it close as he can, though. 
	              (pause)
	          You don't touch yourself, do you?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          What do you mean?
	
	                    KARL
	          Pull on your works. Your privates.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Oh, jackin' off?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir. You ort not know that
	          language.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I didn't know till here while back
	          a year or two ago when I spent the
	          night with Ronnie Smart one time.
	          He said just tug on your peter and
	          think about your mama. I tried it,
	          but I felt funny thinkin' about my
	          mama. So, I switched over to
	          thinkin' about his mama and then
	          what he told me would happen,
	          happened. It sure tingles, don't
	          it?
	
	                    KARL 
	          You ort not to pull on yourself
	          that away.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I kind of like you tellin' me what
	          to do and not to do. Just like my
	          daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'
	          me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to
	          do. Mama said the only way to ever
	          get away from him is for him to get
	          away from us. That we can't leave
	          him or he'll try and hurt her.
	
	                    KARL 
	          He ain't no count.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You don't seem like a daddy. You
	          seem like a brother. 
	              (pause)
	          Wonder what makes you like somebody
	          right off when you don't even know
	          'em like what happened with me and
	          you.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon I know.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          And then some people you don't like
	          right off. It's funny. 
	              (pause)
	          You know why I want you to play
	          ball with me?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if
	          you ain't no good. It takes your
	          mind off of everything else while
	          you're doin' it. When you run real
	          fast tryin' to make a touchdown you
	          don't think about anything else. I
	          ain't no good, but my daddy always
	          said he was proud of me when I
	          threw a ball or ran with it. Did
	          you have any brothers and sisters
	          growin' up to play with?
	
	                    KARL
	          I had one there for little bit. Hit
	          didn't get old enough to play with.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Why not? It died?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Why?
	
	                    KARL
	          Hit was borned a little too early
	          on. My mother and father made hit
	          come too early some way or other. I
	          reckon they changed their mind
	          about havin' another'n. I was about
	          six or eight year old then and they
	          didn't care too much for me so I
	          reckon they didn't need somethin'
	          else to worry 'em with.
	
	                    FRANK
	          So it died when it come out?
	
	                    KARL
	          My daddy come to the shed out back
	          and got me and said throw this here
	          away and handed me a towel with
	          somethin' in it. I went for the
	          trash barrel there and opened up
	          the towel to see 'cause they was a
	          noise and somethin' movin' in it.
	          Hit was bloody-like around that
	          towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty
	          baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It was alive?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir. Right then it was.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          A boy or girl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          A little ol' boy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You threw it in a trash barrel?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I didn't feel right about doin'
	          that. I takened a shoe box from
	          there in the shed and emptied out
	          some screwdrivers and nuts and
	          warshers from it and put the little
	          feller in that and buried him in
	          the corner of the yard there. That
	          seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It was still alive when you buried
	          it?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I heared it cryin' a little through
	          that box.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          That don't seem right. It seems
	          like you should have kept him alive
	          and took care of him if he was your
	          brother.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon
	          I didn't know what to do. I didn't
	          know how to care for no baby. Mama
	          and Daddy didn't want him. They
	          learned me to do what they told me
	          to. These days I figure it might of
	          been best to give him right back to
	          the Good Lord right off the bat
	          anyhow.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          That makes me feel real sad.
	          Couldn't you have done somethin',
	          Karl? I would have. I wish I would
	          of had him. He'd be here right now.
	          Livin'.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Hits been hard thinkin' about it.
	          They ain't a day goes by I don't
	          think about it. I kindly have a
	          picture of it up in my head that I
	          see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have
	          bad thoughts on it. I wished they
	          was somethin' I could of did, too.
	          Shouldn't no bad things happen to
	          childern. All the ol' bad things
	          ort to be saved up for folks that's
	          growed up, the way I see it. I
	          shouldn't of told you about that. A
	          boy ort not hear about such things.
	          It just kindly come out.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I didn't mean to say anything bad
	          about you. I know you're good. You
	          didn't mean no harm. 
	              (pause)
	          Did you ever think about killin'
	          yourself on purpose like my daddy
	          did?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I've studied about it. The Bible
	          says not to or you end up goin' to
	          Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I
	          call it Hades.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Bible says the same thing about
	          killin' others, too.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir, I reckon it does.
	
	EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
	
	Frank, flowers in hand, and Karl approach a very nice two
	story house. They get to the door and Frank rings the
	doorbell.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I always get nervous when I hear
	          that doorbell. I'm okay just
	          walkin' over, but somethin' about
	          that dang doorbell. They have one
	          room where you can't walk on the
	          carpet or sit on the furniture. I
	          don't see much sense in havin' it.
	
	The door opens and we see an older black lady, the
	HOUSEKEEPER.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER
	              (eyes Karl)
	          Son, I don't know why you keep
	          comin' over here. You know these
	          folks don't want you here. They run
	          you off ever' time. Don't keep
	          doin' this to yourself. You a sweet
	          boy. Now go give them flowers to
	          somebody that'll enjoy 'em.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Ma'am, I really want to give them
	          to Karen.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER
	              (to Karl)
	          You his daddy?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No ma'am.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER 
	          Well, whoever you are, you ought to
	          talk some sense into him. That
	          little old girl is way too fast for
	          him and don't wanna see him no way.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Will you get her for me. Please. I
	          really want to see her.
	          She'll want to see me, too, 'cause
	          we're not in public. Just don't
	          tell her folks I'm here.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER
	              (sighs)
	          Okay.
	
	She disappears and a moment later KAREN appears. She's
	thirteen, pretty and very neatly dressed.
	
	                    KAREN
	              (put out)
	          Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming
	          over here. My parents really don't
	          want you to.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I wanted to bring you some flowers.
	          They're pretty good ones.
	
	                    KAREN 
	          They're from the Dollar Store. I'm
	          not an idiot. Besides we have a
	          garden full of flowers.
	
	She eyes Karl.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I wanted for you to meet Karl, too.
	          He's my new friend. But I feel like
	          I've always known him. I thought
	          you should meet him.
	
	                    KAREN 
	          Why? Hi, Karl.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          He's gonna be around a lot and I
	          hope you are too, so...
	
	                    KAREN 
	          Here give me the flowers, I'll do
	          something with them. Thank you. Now
	          you better go. Maybe I'll see you
	          down at the secret place one day in
	          a week or two or something. I have
	          a boyfriend now you know. And we're
	          pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
	
	She proudly displays the ring.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Can you go there with us now? Me
	          and Karl. We could just hang out.
	          Karl has some cool books.
	
	                    KAREN 
	          Frank, I just like you as a friend.
	          Only at the secret place. Okay? I
	          can't go there now. I'll see you
	          later.
	
	                    FRANK
	          But maybe just for awhile -- 
	
	                    KAREN 
	          I'm closing the door now. I told
	          you, I'll see you later.
	
	She closes the door. They stand therefor a moment, then walk
	away down the sidewalk.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          She said she'd see me later. That's
	          kinda good, right?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - DAY
	
	Frank and Karl walk up the steps to the house. Frank opens
	the door and they enter.
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY
	
	As Frank and Karl enter, they see Doyle sitting on a
	footstool facing Linda who's in a chair. Doyle is holding
	both her hands and talking very softly to her. He sees the
	guys and looks up.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, I'll be damned, there's the
	          boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I
	          wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was
	          just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell,
	          I'll just start over, set down you
	          boys.
	
	They do, on the couch.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Well, what it is is, I just, well I
	          took off work early today and your
	          mama was good enough to do the same
	          so we could talk. I guess you'd say
	          I'm really here to apologize, which
	          ain't easy for me to do, about the
	          way I acted the other night. I was
	          just drunk and kinda got a little
	          too worked up and one thing led to
	          another. I care about y'all a lot,
	          I do. I don't mean to be so damned,
	          assholish I guess the word would
	          be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit
	          you, did I? So no apology needed
	          there I guess, but Frank, I'm
	          sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama.
	          I'm just jealous of her. I don't
	          like her life or the way she runs
	          it. I don't like homosexuals and
	          she buddies with one. I don't like
	          little wimpy ass kids or fuckin'
	          mental retards and she's got one of
	          each livin' with her. 
	              (laughs)
	          I was just kiddin'. But really I
	          guess people need to get along even
	          if they have differences. 
	              (pause)
	          You see, I work construction. I
	          build things. Do you realize how
	          important that is to the world. I
	          have a lot of pressure on me. The
	          upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot
	          more time over here and we're gonna
	          get along. Like a family should. 
	              (to Linda)
	          I may even surprise you one day and
	          pop the question. 
	              (he gets up)
	          Well, I'm goin' back to work. I
	          just wanted to give y'all some
	          little piece of happiness today. 
	              (kisses Linda)
	          See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a
	          good boy, Frank.
	
	He leaves.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Well, at least he's tryin'. But who
	          knows for how long.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do
	          better.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I know honey. Just remember what I
	          said, we'll bide our time. You just
	          steer clear of him as much as you
	          can. Doyle's had a real hard life.
	          It's just about run him crazy I
	          think.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We've had a real hard life, too,
	          Mama.
	
	Linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You're a hell of a boy, Frank.
	          Someday you're gonna get all the
	          good things you deserve. And Karl
	          here's gonna get some more biscuits
	          tonight. What do you think about
	          that?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I could shore use some. Thank ye.
	
	INT. SHOP - DAY
	
	Karl is cleaning some parts in a bucket of gasoline. Bill
	comes to the door.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Hey there Karl, can you come unload
	          a generator for me?
	
	Karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside.
	
	EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
	
	A MAN and a TEENAGE BOY stand by a pickup truck. A small
	generator is on the tailgate.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Karl, lift this thing down and
	          carry it to the back. It's on the
	          blink. 
	              (to man as Karl unloads
	               it)
	          We'll have it for you in a day or
	          two, Walter.
	
	                    WALTER 
	          Y'ont us to he'p you there liftin'
	          that?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a
	          bulldozier. Fix anything, too. 
	              (confidentially)
	          He's mentally retarded, but he's a
	          whiz on small engines. Lord works
	          in mysterious ways.
	
	Karl carries the generator toward the shop. He turns and
	watches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill. The
	man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles
	his hair.
	
	                    WALTER 
	          Hell, he didn't just make the team,
	          Coach says he's probably gonna
	          start at end on defense. He's a
	          chip off the old block. Ain't you,
	          Steve?
	
	                    STEVE 
	          I guess so.
	
	Karl turns and goes in the shop.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY GARAGE - DAY
	
	Karl is on his cot reading a book. Frank comes in. He looks
	very depressed. He sits beside Karl.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          What you readin'?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Readin' on this book on how to work
	          carpentry. I aim to learn how to
	          build things out of wood one of
	          these times. I've always been
	          partial to wood buildin's and
	          cabinets and whatnot. These
	          drawin's they got here don't make
	          no sense to me so far. 
	              (he looks directly at
	               Frank, which he seldom
	               does)
	          You seem like yore tails a'draggin'
	          a might. You got somethin' wrong
	          with ye?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Seems like Doyle's wormed his way
	          back in. Mama said he's stayin'
	          over tonight and he's talkin' about
	          movin' in for good. We ain't ever
	          gonna be happy. We'll always be
	          nervous, won't we Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon I know. I ain't
	          found no way yet and I'm three or
	          four times as old as you. Might be
	          that's just the way folks is.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I feel sad about Karen Cross, too.
	          I just make like to myself she
	          loves me. I know better, though. It
	          just feels good to me when I
	          imagine it.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Make believin' always made me feel
	          good too from time to time.
	
	They sit in silence for a moment.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for
	          a Mister Turner tomorrow and a
	          closin' up shop early.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Is that right?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if
	          neither one of us is no count it
	          won't make no difference.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You will? For sure?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We'll be on teams, me and you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yessir.
	
	EXT. JUNIOR HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
	
	It's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. Karl,
	Frank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up.
	Four boys are lined on defense. They break the huddle and
	come to the line. They are on about the fifty-yard line.
	Frank hikes the ball to one of the boys. He later als it to
	Karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run
	toward him. Then he takes off like the wind. He runs funny,
	kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast. All the others
	are chasing him. Two of the other team's boys catch him on
	about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. Karl
	sees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the
	ball just as Karl bites the dirt. Frank goes into the end
	zone untouched. There are cheers from Frank and the other
	boys. Frank runs over to Karl who's still on the ground.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Way to go, Karl. We got a
	          touchdown. That was a good lateral,
	          man. That was just like the
	          Wishbone.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I dern near had me a touchdown till
	          them boys got a-hold of me there so
	          I figured I better give it off to
	          you. I seen you over there
	          follerin' me.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We're liable to win if we keep this
	          up. For somebody like you, you sure
	          run fast.
	
	He grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Come on, let's kick off to 'em.
	
	EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
	
	Karl and Frank, dirt, grass stains and all, walk toward home.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I know you could of scored them
	          three touchdowns by yourself
	          instead of throwing 'em over to me.
	
	                    KARL
	          Them boys was tryin' to pull me
	          down pretty hard.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You're strong though. You let me
	          make them touchdowns so I'd feel
	          good. My daddy used to do that kind
	          of thing.
	
	They walk in silence for a moment.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          It don't matter to me about us
	          losin' does it to you?
	
	                    KARL
	          No sir.
	
	                    FRANK
	          It was fun, anyhow.
	
	                    KARL
	          I wadn't thinkin' about nothin'
	          else just like you told me I'd do.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Can we play ever' Saturday?
	
	                    KARL 
	          If I ain't too stove up. I ain't
	          like you. I'm old and give out. 
	              (pause)
	          I'm proud of ye.
	
	INT. GARAGE - DAY
	
	Karl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together, deep in
	thought.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Karl is walking down the street past rundown houses. He comes
	to an old gray woodframe house. It is in bad repair, the
	paint is peeling, the yard is grown up. There is an old
	wooden shed in the back yard. He stands looking at it for a
	moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the
	shed. He's motionless for a moment, then goes inside.
	
	INT. SHED - DAY
	
	Sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood. The shed has
	nothing but dirt for a floor. A few tall patches of grass
	shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers. A few old garden
	tools hang on the wall. In the center is a low circular spot
	in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt.
	Karl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and
	walks out of the shed.
	
	EXT. YARD - DAY
	
	Karl walks across the yard to the house.
	
	INT. SCREENED-IN PORCH - DAY
	
	Karl goes onto the screened-in porch, looks through the
	kitchen window and goes inside.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - DAY
	
	The place is a mess. Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and
	on the table. It's not just clutter, but filth everywhere.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an OLD
	MAN in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap.
	Karl stands facing him for several moments.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm ye boy.
	
	                    OLD MAN 
	          I ain't got no boy.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
	
	                    OLD MAN 
	          I ain't got no boy.
	
	                    KARL 
	          They turned me aloose from the
	          nervous hospital. Said I was well.
	
	No response.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox
	          fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.
	
	No response.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          That grass out in the yard's all
	          growed up. I figured I might cut it
	          fer ye.
	
	                    OLD MAN 
	          I told you, I ain't got no boy, now
	          get on out from here and let me be.
	
	Long silence.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I learned to read some. I've read
	          on the Bible quite a bit. I don't
	          understand all of it, but I believe
	          I understand a good deal of it.
	          Them stories Mama and you told me
	          ain't in there. You ort not to of
	          done that to ye boy. 
	              (pause)
	          I've studied on killin' you. But I
	          don't reckon they's no reason fer
	          it if all you're gonna do is set
	          there in that chair. You'll be dead
	          soon enough I reckon and the
	          world'll be shut of ye. 
	              (Karl walks toward the
	               kitchen and turns back to
	               the old man)
	          You ort not to of killed my
	          brother. He ort to have had a
	          chance to grow up. Sometimes he
	          would of had fun.
	
	EXT. YARD
	
	Karl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in
	the corner and kneels down. He pushes some grass aside to
	reveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across. In front of
	it, the ground is raised a little. He stares at the rock for
	a moment and touches it.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Little feller.
	
	EXT. A LARGE OLD WOODEN SLAT BRIDGE - DUSK
	
	Karl stands on the side of the bridge looking into the river
	below.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	All the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed
	asleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in bed
	staring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring.
	Suddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp
	and sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a
	start. From their P.O.V. we see Karl standing in the door
	holding a hammer.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          What in the goddamn hell are you
	          doin'? It's the middle of the
	          night.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          What do you want, hun?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I want to be baptized.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Baptized? Well, get baptized then.
	          I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin'
	          preacher, goddamnit! I can't
	          baptize you.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          We'll go to church and get you
	          baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go
	          on back to bed.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          What are you doin' with that damn
	          hammer?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't rightly know. I just kindly
	          woke up a-holdin' it.
	
	INT. CHURCH - DAY
	
	We see a shot of Frank and Linda and Vaughan in a church pew.
	The church is pretty full. From their P.O.V. we seek Karl in
	a robe standing in the baptismal tank. The preacher takes
	Karl and dunks him under the water and brings him back up.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Doyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl come
	through the front door.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          How'd your baptizin' go?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          It went real good.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, that's good. It's about time
	          to eat and you know what I'm
	          cravin'? Some of that take out
	          chicken. Why don't you run get some
	          of it, honey, for lunch?
	
	                    LINDA
	              (to Frank and Karl)
	          Would y'all like that?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Yeah, I guess.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken
	          leg.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          All right, y'all gonna go with me?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Naw, hell, let them stay here with
	          me and do men things. There might
	          be some kind of ball game on we can
	          watch. You go on.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I'll be back in a little bit then.
	
	She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I really just wanted to git your
	          mama out of the house for a minute
	          so we can have a talk. Y'all set
	          down.
	
	They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Now here's the deal. Now that I'm
	          gonna throw my entire life away
	          doin' what I want to come live here
	          with y'all, we have to get a few
	          things straight. See, Frank, me and
	          you mama wouldn't have any problems
	          if it wadn't for you. We'd never
	          have a bad word between us. But
	          since you do exist, if I'm gonna be
	          here as the head of the household,
	          we'll have to live by my rules.
	          And my rules are you don't speak
	          unless you're spoken to. Stay out
	          of my way and do what a regular kid
	          does. You're a weird little shit. I
	          don't get you. So wake up. Face
	          what they call reality. We're gonna
	          be a family now. And it's my
	          family. I'll be payin' the bills so
	          you got me. But I ain't your daddy.
	          You just treat me like I am. I'm
	          the boss, okay. And the other thing
	          is your friend Karl has to go. We
	          can't have a normal family with him
	          livin' in the garage and comin' in
	          the bedroom at four in the mornin'
	          with hammers and shit. See?
	
	                    FRANK
	          Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama
	          said --
	
	Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm.
	Doyle shakes him off.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Don't hit that boy no more.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You shut up you, fuckin' retard.
	          Get your shit and get out of here. 
	              (to Frank)
	          That was a wake-up slap, Frank.
	          Remember. Reality, like I said.
	          Don't forget any bit of what I said
	          to you and we'll be fine.
	
	Frank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in
	his chair and pops a beer. Karl gets up and goes to the
	garage.
	
	INT. GARAGE - DAY
	
	Karl ties his books up with his strap and gets a bag from his
	bed and leaves.
	
	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
	
	Karl is walking away as Linda pulls up in her car and gets
	out with fast-food bags.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't
	          you want some chicken and things?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well, okay. I got you some.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Frank, he went off, too. He ain't
	          gonna be in there when you get
	          indoors.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
	
	                    KARL 
	          He wanted to go off and play, I
	          reckon. 
	              (pause)
	          You go in there and you and that
	          Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have
	          to worry yourself none.
	
	                    LINDA
	          All right then. Well, I'll see you
	          later. If you see Frank, tell him
	          to come on back home. I don't get
	          to see him all day except Sundays.
	          He can play tomorrow.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Ma'am?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL 
	          You're a good mama to that boy. You
	          care for him. You work hard fer him
	          to take care of him. You light him
	          up in his eyes, I've seen it. He
	          wouldn't know what to do without
	          ye.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well thank you, hun. That's real
	          good of you to say. I wouldn't know
	          what to do without him either.
	
	                    KARL 
	          You've been real good to me, too.
	          It ain't ever'body that'd make
	          biscuits in the middle of the
	          night. You and that boy has give me
	          a good feelin'.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          We sure like havin' you.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye. 
	              (Karl walks away, then
	               turns)
	          I'm just getting around to tellin'
	          you, but I fixed your warshin'
	          machine.
	
	EXT. SECRET PLACE - DAY
	
	Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a
	stick. He hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees
	Karl coming toward him.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come
	          out here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I knowed you'd be here. 
	              (Karl sits on the stump)
	          What are you a-doin' digging with
	          that stob?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Just diggin'. 
	              (pause)
	          I ain't ever gonna be happy now.
	          Not with that son of a bitch movin'
	          in for good. I wish me and you and
	          Mama could just run away. But she
	          said he would find us wherever we
	          went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think
	          it would of been better if I wadn't
	          ever born.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm glad of it you was borned. 
	              (pause)
	          I reckon I ain't gonna be there in
	          the garage no more.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You have to Karl. You have to look
	          out for me. You don't let that son
	          of a bitch run you off.
	
	                    KARL 
	          You're just a boy. You ort not to
	          use that sort of language.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin'
	          bad about you, but why don't you
	          stop Doyle when he gets that away?
	          You're older than him. You're
	          strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let
	          him do that to me and Mama.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That feller's a whole sight meaner
	          than me. He'd just whup the tar out
	          of me.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired,
	          you know that. A kid my age
	          shouldn't be tired of things.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm tired, too, Frank. 
	              (pause)
	          If I ain't around no more, it don't
	          mean I don't care fer ye. I care
	          for ye a good deal. I care for you
	          more than anybody they is. We made
	          friends right off the bat.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I care for you, too. But you'll be
	          around, don't say that.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Hit don't make no difference where
	          I was to be. We'll always be
	          friends. There ain't no way to stop
	          that. 
	              (pause)
	          I aim for you to have these books.
	
	He hands him the books.
	
	                    KARL
	          Maybe you can make more sense out
	          of them than I can.
	          I made you a little old book marker
	          and stuck it in that book on
	          Christmas.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You don't want to give away all
	          your books.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I aim fer you to have 'em.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Man. Thanks. 
	              (pause)
	          You know when you get a feelin' and
	          you don't know why?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I've got a feelin' today.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Like something different. I don't
	          know. 
	              (pause)
	          You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Will ye do somethin' for me if I
	          ast you to?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You know I would. Whatever you
	          want.
	
	                    KARL
	          Don't go home tonight and stay with
	          that Doyle. He's got it in for ye
	          tonight. I got me a feelin', too.
	          Feels like to me you ort not be
	          there in that house with him
	          liquored up and mean. Ye mama
	          neither. When you get up from here,
	          I want you to go to that feller's
	          house. Your mama's friend. I want
	          you to give me your word on it.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Okay. I give you my word. Is
	          ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you
	          all right?
	
	                    KARL
	          Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly
	          want to put my arm around ye for a
	          minute and then I'm gonna go on and
	          leave here.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Okay.
	
	Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand
	on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then
	Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes
	the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a
	folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be
	happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in
	the trees.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Karl!
	
	Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other
	through the trees.
	
	EXT. VAUGHAN'S HOUSE - DAY
	
	Karl knocks on the door. After a moment, Vaughan answers in a
	pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Karl, what are you doing here? Come
	          in.
	
	                    KARL
	          I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast
	          you fer a favor.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Okay.
	
	                    KARL
	          This evenin' I want you to go get
	          Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and
	          have them stay with you tonight.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          What's wrong? Is everything okay?
	
	                    KARL 
	          That dern Doyle is in a bad way
	          again with that drinkin' and bein'
	          mean to folks. Will you give me
	          your word you'll do it?
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt
	          them, has he?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw, not yet. 
	              (hands the bag to Vaughan)
	          I want ye to give this to Mizz
	          Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe
	          there's a little somethin' to hep
	          out. Hits what I've earned fixin'
	          lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill
	          Cox.
	
	Vaughan takes the bag.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          What about you, Karl? Do you want
	          to stay here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon you have to go with
	          women to be a daddy to a boy. 
	              (pause)
	          You've been real square dealin'
	          with me. The Bible says two men ort
	          not lay together. But I'll bet you
	          the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody
	          like you to Hades. Some folks calls
	          it Hell, I call it Hades. 
	              (Karl starts away)
	          That boy lives inside of his own
	          heart. Hits an awful big place. You
	          take care of that boy.
	
	Vaughan watches Karl walk away.
	
	EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT
	
	Karl stares at the bus station door.
	
	EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Karl stares at the house from the sidewalk.
	
	EXT. OLD WOODS BRIDGE - NIGHT
	
	Karl stares into the river.
	
	INT. COX'S SHOP - NIGHT
	
	Karl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel.
	
	EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Karl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the
	living room.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching TV. He looks
	up as Karl comes around and sits on the sofa.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Where's ever'body else? You seen
	          'em? 
	              (no response)
	          I thought I told you to get the
	          hell moved out of here anyway.
	
	                    KARL 
	          How does a feller go about gettin'
	          ahold of the police?
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Pick up the fuckin' phone and call
	          'em, I guess.
	
	                    KARL 
	          What numbers do you punch?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I told you to get away from here,
	          didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and
	          look at TV. 
	              (notices blade)
	          What are you doin' with that piece
	          of iron? I swear to God you're the
	          weirdest son of a bitch I ever
	          heard of.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I aim to kill you with it.
	
	Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police
	          you push 911. You'll need to tell
	          'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a
	          hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're
	          gonna kill me. 
	              (laughs)
	
	Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We
	see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear
	one short dull thud.
	
	                    DOYLE (O.S.) 
	          Oh God! Oh God!
	
	We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting
	the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to
	the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it
	for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood
	on his face, hand and shirt.
	
	                    KARL 
	              (into phone)
	          Yes ma'am. I need the police over
	          here at the Wheatley house. 
	              (pause)
	          I've killed somebody with a mower
	          blade. 
	              (pause)
	          Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I
	          hit him two good whacks. That
	          second time just plumb near cut his
	          head in two. 
	              (pause)
	          Hits a little old yeller house
	          right on the corner of Marigold
	          Street and some other street.
	          They's a red pickup truck out front
	          says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION
	          on it. I'll be a settin' here
	          waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the
	          police, Doyle said you might want
	          to send a ambulance or a hearse.
	          Thank ye.
	
	He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar
	of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the
	kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering
	up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the
	mustard jar and runs the knife around it.
	There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the
	biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.
	
	                                        CUT TO:
	
	CLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE
	
	He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull
	back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital
	again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl
	is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          ... on the third day I washed her.
	          She wasn't very clean. I got all
	          the right spots. She was the first
	          one I ever kept for any length of
	          time, you see I get bored easily, I
	          have a short attention span. I
	          can't say she enjoyed her stay,
	          although the washcloth in her mouth
	          held in place by good duct tape
	          kept any complaints to a minimum. I
	          don't really like people who talk a
	          lot. I like to do the talking. I
	          guess that's why I'm so fond of
	          you. You're so easygoing, although
	          I do sense a little tension in you
	          sometimes. By the way, how was it
	          out there? Did you have any fun?
	          Make any new acquaintances? Tell me
	          what it was like.
	
	                    KARL 
	          They was a boy. We made friends.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          I bet you did. I was never bent
	          that way. I'm bent the other way.
	          So, you liked it out there in the
	          world.
	
	                    KARL 
	          It's too big.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          Well, it's not too big in here, is
	          it? 
	              (pause)
	          I feel very generous today. I feel
	          like listening. I'm sure you have
	          plenty to tell me. And please bore
	          me with the details. 
	              (long pause) )
	          Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was
	          it the boy?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Don't say nothin' about that boy.
	
	Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.
	
	                    KARL
	          Fact the bidness, don't you say
	          another word to me. I ain't
	          listenin' to you no more.
	
	Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the
	grass that separates him from the next building. He stares
	out the window, as we:
	
	                                        FADE OUT.
	
	                          THE END
FADE IN:
	
	INT. A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
	
	A few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man
	sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper
	with a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette
	and staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man,
	KARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his
	hands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring
	and Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant
	approaches Charles.
	
	                    ATTENDANT 
	          You can't smoke in here.
	
	Charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues
	smoking. He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then
	looks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          A Mercury is a good car and that's
	          what I was driving that day. I've
	          owned a lot of cars. Different
	          kinds. Lots of different kinds of
	          cars. She was standing, this girl,
	          on the side of the street where
	          there was a chicken stand; not the
	          Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
	          a chicken stand, and I pulled the
	          Mercury over and rolled down the
	          window by electric power. She was
	          wearing a leather skirt and she had
	          a lot of hair on her arms. I like
	          that. I like it a lot. It means a
	          big bush. I like a big bush. She
	          said, "Are you dating?" I said,
	          "yes," and she got in the car. We
	          pulled to a remote location, one
	          that she and I both felt
	          comfortable with and she said, "How
	          much can you spend?" I said, "What
	          it takes to see your bush. I know
	          it's a big one." She said "twenty
	          five dollars," which to a working
	          man is not chicken feed. I produced
	          the money and she put it in her
	          shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
	          before me lay a thin, crooked,
	          uncircumcised penis. You can
	          imagine how badly I wanted my
	          twenty-five dollars back.
	
	INT. A HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Two young women, MARSHA DWIGGINS, carrying a briefcase, and
	THERESA EVANS, carrying two camera bags are being led down
	the hallway by a GUARD.
	
	                    THERESA 
	          I don't know why you're so weirded
	          out, this is not San Quentin, it's
	          just a nuthouse. Most of these
	          people don't even know where they
	          are, they're not gonna hurt you.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          In a few minutes we're gonna be in
	          a room with a killer. That doesn't

	          Hey, you're the one that wanted to
	          major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't
	          the guy something like twelve or
	          thirteen when he did it, it was
	          twenty-five years ago, he probably
	          doesn't even remember it.

	          Yeah.
	
	They reach a door and the guard ushers them through.
	
	INT. AN OFFICE - DAY
	
	JERRY WOOLRIDGE stands up from behind the desk as they enter.
	He's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop
	class or perhaps eighth-grade science.

	          These are the people from that
	          newspaper deal.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Oh yeah, from the college?
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Yes sir.
	
	Woolridge shakes hands with them. 
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          My name's Jerry Woolridge.
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha
	          Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans.
	          She's here to take the pictures.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Y'all have a seat. Is this all of
	          you?
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          I think there must have been a
	          little mix up. I told your sponsor
	          or teacher or whatever he is, there
	          couldn't be any pictures. It's
	          s'posed to be just a little story
	          or article or something, isn't that
	          right?
	
	                    MARSHA
	          Well, yeah, it's for the school
	          newspaper. But it has pictures. I
	          mean it's a regular paper, you
	          know. 
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Karl's real sensitive about having
	          his picture made. He wouldn't even
	          be on the bulletin board for the
	          Easter Collage. 
	              (to guard) 
	          Melvin, would you get me a good hot
	          cup with two sugar substitutes? You
	          girls want some coffee?
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          No thank you.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          The other thing is I told your boss
	          on the phone to send a man. Karl
	          won't talk to women.
	
	INT. REC ROOM - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another
	monologue.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          There was a young man named John
	          Liggit Hunter who was in the
	          filling station business and a good
	          filling station business. He was
	          one of those young men that we run
	          across so often in life. I'm sure
	          you've run across them, that didn't
	          deserve the things he had. One of
	          those things was his beautiful
	          bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
	          Peach. As a matter of fact she
	          looked more like the picture I've
	          had in my head than any woman I've
	          ever seen. I took it upon myself to
	          take her away from John Liggit
	          Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
	          not sure if I mentioned that he was
	          a Frenchman who claimed to be an
	          Englishman. It took some very
	          strong nylon cord to take her away
	          from him. She was a fighter as well
	          as a Georgia Peach.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE
	
	The girls look confused.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I don't know what to tell you. I'm
	          sorry. I made myself pretty clear I
	          thought. He probably got busy and
	          wasn't thinking. I know how that
	          is. I used to teach shop and eighth
	          grade science.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Well, what do we do? We drove all
	          the way out here.
	
	                    THERESA 
	          Let's just go, Marsha.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          No, we have to get this story.
	
	                    THERESA 
	          I thought you'd be happy to leave.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Why won't he talk to women?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He has problems. You know. With all
	          that. He won't hardly talk to
	          anybody really. Just certain
	          people. He's very troubled.

	                    WOOLRIDGE
	              (takes a drink of coffee)
	          I don't think he's talked to a
	          woman in twenty-five or so years.
	          That I know of anyway. That's why I
	          said to send a man. At least maybe
	          he'd answer a question or two for a
	          man. I'm all for helping the
	          college out, believe me. It might
	          be a real good article or story.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk
	          him into it. I'm a real good
	          interviewer. Just get me in the
	          room with him.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	              (to guard)
	          Melvin, go get Karl and take him
	          down to the old classroom.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Woolridge and the two women walk down the hallway.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I'll talk to him and see what we
	          can do.
	
	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
	
	Woolridge is opening a door. He enters and the women follow
	him in. He flips on a light switch and very bright florescent
	lights illuminate the room.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          You see, Karl, growing up, only
	          knew that sex was wrong and that
	          people who did it should be killed
	          for it. He couldn't really read
	          but, well, neither could his
	          mother. But, his father made sure
	          that his mother knew what the Bible
	          said. And she made sure Karl knew.
	          You know he slept in a hole in the
	          ground under a toolshed, right?
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          I knew he slept in a toolshed.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          His mother told him that he was
	          their punishment. Hers and his
	          father's; from God, for having sex--
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Before they were married?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I don't think so. Just period, I
	          think. She told him... God gave
	          them the ugliest creation he could
	          think of. Karl has an entire book --
	          a notebook. On every page it says
	          "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
	          1." He wrote that a few years ago
	          after he'd learned to write. His
	          father's name was Franklin.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          That's really strange. What does it
	          mean?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I
	          imagine. Y'all pull up a chair.
	          I'll go out and talk to him.
	
	INT. REC ROOM
	
	CLOSE UP on Charles's face.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          You have to make something explode
	          to truly understand it. You have to
	          examine the tiny particles while
	          they're on fire.
	
	Off screen we hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. We pull back and
	see MELVIN the guard.
	
	                    MELVIN 
	          Karl, I gotta take you down to the
	          old classroom. Mr. Woolridge has
	          some people for you to see down
	          there. Come on. Let's go.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Melvin and Karl walk down the hallway. Woolridge stands
	outside the door of the classroom. They reach him and
	Woolridge talks quietly to Karl.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Karl, you know, do you remember
	          when I told you about those people
	          from that newspaper? 
	              (pause)
	          They want to ask you some questions
	          about your release. They think it
	          would make an interesting story.
	          Will you talk to 'em? Get
	          interviewed. 
	              (pause)
	          Now, they're women. I think it
	          might be good for you to. You're
	          gonna be seein' all kinds of people
	          when you go on the outside. This'll
	          help you I believe.
	
	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
	
	It's just Woolridge and the two women in the room.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, it surprised the dickens out
	          of me. He said he'll talk to you.
	
	Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
	          But, here's the thing. He'll only
	          talk to you. He doesn't want you to
	          ask him anything. And you shouldn't
	          stare at him.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          How am I going to conduct an
	          interview if I can't ask him any
	          questions?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          It's the best you're gonna get. I'm
	          sorry.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Can I ask you a question? If he's
	          so troubled, why are you letting
	          him out? What if he does it again?
	          It happens all the time.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He's free. His time's up. That's
	          the rules. He's been treated and
	          reevaluated. He doesn't show any
	          signs any more.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Signs?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna
	          change the light in here for Karl.
	          I hope you can see to write.
	
	Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
	overhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in.
	In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions
	for Marsha to sit. Karl stands beside Melvin motionless.
	Woolridge whispers to Theresa.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
	          You'll have to step outside.
	
	Theresa starts to protest.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
	          Please.
	
	Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin
	ushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at
	the floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing
	strangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like
	forever.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Theresa stands on one side of the door, Melvin on the other.
	
	                    THERESA
	          Can I just sneak in there? I won't
	          take any pictures, I promise. I
	          just want to listen.
	
	                    MELVIN
	          No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.
	
	Theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light
	it.
	
	                    MELVIN (CONT'D)
	          You can't smoke in here. I'm sorry.
	
	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
	
	Marsha is staring at Karl. Karl, still breathing and rubbing
	his palms, starts to speak. His voice is low and raspy, but
	not just low and raspy; strange.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Well, I reckon what you're a
	          wanting to know is what I'm doing
	          in here. I reckon the reason I'm in
	          here is 'cause I killed somebody.
	          But I reckon what you was a wanting
	          to know is how come me to kill
	          somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start
	          at the front and tell you. 
	              (pause, heavy breathing)
	          I lived most of my life out behind
	          my mother and father's house in a
	          little old shed and my daddy'd
	          built for me. They didn't too much
	          want me up there in the house with
	          the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
	          around out there in the shed all
	          the time a lookin' at the ground.
	          It didn't have no floor but I had
	          me a hole dug out to lay down in
	          and a quilt or tow that I put down
	          there. 
	              (pause, more breathing)
	          My daddy was a hard workin' man
	          most of his life, not that I can
	          say the same fer myself. I most
	          just set around the shed and
	          tinkered around with a lawn mower
	          or two and went to school off and
	          on from time to time but the
	          children there made quite a bit of
	          sport of me, made fun of me quite a
	          bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
	          sometimes so mostly I stayed out
	          back there in the shed. My daddy
	          worked down at the sawmill there,
	          down there at the planer mill for
	          an old man named Dixon.
	          Old man Dixon was a very cruel
	          feller, he didn't treat his
	          employees very well, didn't pay 'em
	          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
	          much of a wage, just barely enough
	          to get by on. But I reckon he got
	          by all right, they come out one or
	          the other of 'em, usually my
	          mother, and fed me pretty regular.
	          At least I know he made enough for
	          me to have mustard and biscuits
	          three or four times a week. Old man
	          Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
	          Jesse was really more cruel than
	          his daddy. He made quite a bit of
	          sport of me and takened advantage
	          of the little girls around the
	          neighborhood quite a bit. 
	              (pause)
	          He used to say my mother was a very
	          pretty woman. He said it quite a
	          bit from time to time, when I was
	          at the school house. Well, I reckon
	          you want me to get on and tell you
	          what happened so I reckon I'll tell
	          you. I was settin' out in the shed
	          one evenin' not doin' too much,
	          just kindly starin' at the wall and
	          a waitin' fer my mother to come out
	          and give me my Bible lesson and I
	          heared a commotion up in the house
	          there so I got up and run up on the
	          screened-in porch there to see what
	          was a goin' on, and I looked in the
	          kitchen window and I seen my mother
	          a layin' there on the floor without
	          any clothes on. 
	              (pause, breathing)
	          And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
	          top of her having his way with her. 
	              (pause)
	          Well, I just seen red. I picked up
	          a kaiser blade that was a layin'
	          there by the screen door, some
	          folks calls it a sling blade, I
	          call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
	          long handle like a axe handle with
	          a long blade on it that's shaped
	          kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
	          edge and dull on the other. It's
	          what the highway boys use to cut
	          down weeds and whatnot.
	          I went in the kitchen there and I
	          hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
	          with it and knocked him off my
	          mother. I reckon that didn't quite
	          satisfy me so I hit him again in
	          the neck with the sharp edge and
	          just plumb near cut his head off.
	          Killed him. Well, my mother, she
	          jumped up from there and started
	          yellin', "What did you kill Jesse
	          fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
	              (pause, intense breathing)
	          Well, come to find out my mother
	          didn't really mind what Jesse was a
	          doin' to her. I reckon that made me
	          madder than what Jesse had made me.
	          I takened the kaiser blade, some
	          folks calls it a sling blade, I
	          call it a kaiser blade and hit my
	          mother up side the head with it an'
	          killed her.
	              (long pause, breathing)
	          Some folks has asked me if I had it
	          to do over again would I do the
	          same thing. I don't know, I reckon
	          I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
	          put me in here and here I've been
	          for a great long while. I've
	          learned to read some; took me four
	          years to read the Bible. I reckon I
	          understand a good deal of it. It
	          wasn't what I expected in a lot of
	          places. I've slept in a good bed
	          for a great long while. They've
	          seen fit to put me out now. They
	          tell me they're a settin' me free
	          today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
	          you need to know. If you want any
	          more details I reckon I can tell
	          'em to you. I don't know if that's
	          enough for your newspaper or not.
	
	Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Will you ever kill anybody again,
	          Karl?
	
	This seems to startle the very room itself. Woolridge motions
	for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still. Very still. He
	breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. He seems
	almost at ease. He slowly looks up. From Karl's point of view
	we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light. Karl is looking
	straight at Marsha.
	
	                    KARL 
	              (slowly)
	          I don't reckon I got no reason to
	          kill nobody.
	
	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
	
	Woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with Marsha
	and Theresa. Karl stands down the way a few feet with Melvin.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Is he leaving right this minute?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          We've got some paperwork to take
	          care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry,
	          you won't run into him in the
	          parking lot.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          I didn't mean that.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I hope the best for you, Miss
	          Dwiggins, with your school and your
	          paper and all.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Where will he go?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Wherever he wants to. I think he's
	          going back to Millsburg where he's
	          from. It's just about twenty miles
	          from here.
	
	                    MARSHA 
	          Will he be supervised?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          As much as anybody else is, I
	          guess. Y'all have a good rest of
	          the day now.
	
	Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit. As they pass Karl he
	speaks to Marsha.
	
	                    KARL
	              (looking down)
	          Thank you.
	
	                    MARSHA
	              (immediately extends her
	               hand) 
	          Thank you.
	
	Karl doesn't take her hand.
	
	Karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
	          to looking at pretty people.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Yes, I guess you are.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
	          to them lookin' at me, too.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          You better go get your things.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't got nothing but them books.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          You better go get 'em.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	Karl walks slowly down the hallway.
	
	EXT. BUS STATION - MILLSBURG - DAY
	
	Karl steps off the bus carrying a few books by a strap. He
	stands there for moment staring at the bus station as the few
	people around stare at him, then he starts walking.
	
	A SERIES OF SHOTS
	
	Karl standing in front of a barbershop looking through the
	window at a man having his hair cut.
	
	In front of the police station.
	
	Staring at an empty school yard...
	
	EXT. DAIRY QUEEN - DAY
	
	Karl stands and stares at the building for a moment. He sees
	a woman take a tray of food from the window.
	When she's gone, he walks up to the window. A pimply-faced
	TEENAGE BOY comes to wait on him. 
	
	                    BOY
	          Can I help you?
	
	                    KARL
	          I was kindly wantin' somethin' or
	          'nother d'eat.
	
	                    BOY
	          Well, what did you want?
	
	                    KARL
	          You have any biscuits for sale?
	
	                    BOY
	          Naw, we don't have biscuits.
	
	Karl stands in silence for a moment.
	
	                    BOY (CONT'D)
	          Did you decide, sir?
	
	                    KARL
	          What you got that's good to eat?
	
	                    BOY
	          Well, I guess it's all good.
	
	                    KARL
	          What do you like to eat here?
	
	                    BOY
	          French fries. I like to eat them
	          pretty good.
	
	                    KARL
	          French-fried potaters.
	
	                    BOY
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL
	          How much you want fer 'em? I'll get
	          some of them I reckon.
	
	                    BOY
	          Sixty for small and seventy-five
	          for large.
	
	                    KARL
	          Give me the big'uns.
	
	Karl digs in his pocket for money.
	
	EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
	
	Karl sits on a bench eating french fries. After a moment, a
	twelve- or thirteen-year-old BOY comes out of the laundromat
	wrestling three or four big bags of laundry. He can't seem to
	get a plan together for carrying them all. Karl gets up and
	goes over to him. The boy looks up at Karl, a little startled
	by Karl's strange figure looming over him.
	
	                    BOY
	          These dang things are heavy. Hard
	          to carry, too.
	
	                    KARL
	          What you got in there, warshing?
	
	                    BOY
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL
	          Ain't you got no mama and daddy to
	          tend to it?
	
	                    BOY
	          I got a mama, but she's at work
	          over at Ben's Dollar Store. My
	          daddy's dead. 
	              (pause)
	          He got hit by a train.
	
	                    KARL
	          How fer you going with them sacks
	          full of warsh?
	
	                    BOY
	          About a half a mile I think it is.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'll help you tote 'em if I don't
	          give out first.
	
	                    BOY
	          Okay. You don't have to though.
	
	Karl picks up two sacks and they walk away.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	They walk in silence for a while before the boy finally
	speaks.
	
	                    BOY
	          My name is Frank Wheatley. What's
	          your name?
	
	                    KARL
	          Karl's my name.
	
	                    FRANK (BOY)
	          What's you last name?
	
	                    KARL
	          Childers.
	
	                    FRANK
	          What are all them books?
	
	                    KARL
	          Different ones. One's the Bible.
	          One of 'ems a book on Christmas.
	          One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          How come you're carryin' them
	          around with you.
	
	                    KARL
	          Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Don't you live somewhere?
	
	                    KARL
	          I did live there in the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Why'd you live there?
	
	                    KARL
	          I killed some folks quite awhile
	          back. They said I wadn't right in
	          the head and they put me in there
	          in the nervous hospital instead of
	          puttin' me in jail.
	
	                    FRANK
	          They let you out?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK
	          How come?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They told me I was well. They had
	          to turn me loose.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Are you well?
	
	                    KARL
	          I reckon I feel all right.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You don't seem like you'd kill
	          nobody.
	
	They reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up
	the sidewalk.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          This is my house. You can just set
	          those bags on the porch.
	
	Karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each
	other in silence for a moment.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Do you like to play football?
	
	                    KARL
	          I never was much count at it. I
	          never did get picked out fer it.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Me and the Burnett twins and some
	          boys plays down at the junior high
	          practice field all the time. If you
	          ever want to come by and play. We
	          ain't no good either. Well, I'll
	          see you later.
	
	He goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door.
	
	INT. BUS STATION - DAY
	
	Karl stands at the counter. A middle-aged man is selling
	tickets.
	
	                    KARL 
	          How does a feller go about gettin'
	          up to the state hospital?
	
	                    MAN 
	          You buy a ticket for fourteen
	          dollars and then set and wait for
	          the four-fifteen bus to Kelton.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
	
	Karl walks down the hallway carrying his books. A couple
	staffers give him 'Why are you still here' looks. He reaches
	a door and goes in.
	
	INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
	
	There is no one at the desk in the outer office, so Karl goes
	into Woolridge's office.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	Karl finds Woolridge doing paper work. Woolridge looks up
	startled.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Karl, what in the world are you
	          doing here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I want to come back and stay here.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, you can't do that. You're a
	          free man. You've been let out to do
	          as you please.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I don't care nothin' about
	          bein' a free man. I don't know how
	          to go about it.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, you have to learn. It'll take
	          some time. Don't you know anybody
	          down there to help you out?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Your daddy's still livin' down
	          there from what you told me. 
	              (pause)
	          I guess he wouldn't help you any,
	          would he? I wasn't thinking. You
	          don't know anybody?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw. Never did know too much of
	          nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	              (sighs)
	          Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't
	          know where they expect you to go or
	          what they expect you to do. If it
	          was up to me, I'd let you stay here
	          if that's what you wanted. I'm just
	          doin' my job. 
	              (they sit in silence for a
	               moment)
	          You follow me? 
	              (no answer)
	          Listen, I know an old boy that runs
	          a fix-it shop deal down in
	          Millsburg. He used to go to church
	          with me. You're good workin' on
	          small engines and things. If I put
	          my neck out for you with him, will
	          you work at it if he'll hire you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn
	          mowers and whatnot.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I know, I've seen it myself. Would
	          you give that a try?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I can't promise he'll hire you.
	          I'll have to tell him about your
	          history.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I never was no good with history.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          No, I mean your past. About why you
	          were in here. 
	              (pause)
	          I'll take you first thing in the
	          mornin'. You have anyplace you can
	          stay tonight at all?
	          I just can't let you stay here.
	          It's the rules. If something
	          happened well, I'd be liable.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I can just walk around
	          till the mornin'. Or set and read
	          me a book somewhere.
	
	They sit and stare at each other for a moment.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE DEN - NIGHT
	
	Woolridge, his WIFE, his teenage SON, BUBBA, and teenage
	DAUGHTER sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely
	uncomfortable and staring at Karl, who is sitting on the edge
	of a chair looking at the floor. After a long creepy moment,
	Mom speaks.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE
	          Karl, would you like a muffin?
	
	                    KARL
	          No thank ye.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE
	          I understand Jerry is going to take
	          you somewhere else tomorrow.
	
	                    KARL
	          I don't reckon I know nobody name
	          Jerry.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          She's talkin' about me, Karl.
	          That's my first name.
	
	                    KARL
	          He's a-carryin' me to look fer work
	          in Millsburg where I was borned.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE
	          Would you like some coffee?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Coffee makes me a might nervous
	          when I drink it.
	
	                    DAUGHTER 
	          Daddy, can I be excused to go to
	          bed?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama
	          tonight. I'll sleep with your
	          brother and Karl can take your
	          room.
	
	                    DAUGHTER
	          Why?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          We have company. Now you go on.
	
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	It's an all-American girls room. Everything is pink. There
	are stuffed animals everywhere and posters of pop idols.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, Karl, there's plenty of
	          blankets and things there.
	          Bathroom's right there in the hall.
	          We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
	
	Karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books.
	Woolridge closes the door.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Woolridge walks into the kitchen where Mom and Son sit at the
	table.
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE 
	          Jerry, why didn't you give him
	          Bubba's room? Sister's is kind of
	          girly, isn't it?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Yeah, I thought about that. No
	          sense in moving him now I guess.
	
	                    BUBBA 
	          Daddy, don't you think one of us
	          ought to stay up all night and kind
	          of - guard or somethin'?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Why, hell no, son. What's wrong
	          with you?
	
	                    BUBBA 
	          Well, he's crazy. He's a nut ain't
	          he?
	
	                    MRS. WOOLRIDGE 
	          'Isn't' he, Bubba. Don't say ain't.
	
	INT. WOOLRIDGE DEN AND HALLWAY - MORNING
	
	Woolridge, already dressed, walks through the den and down
	the hallway. He knocks on the bedroom door.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Karl, you up?
	
	                    KARL (O.S.) 
	          Yes sir.
	
	Woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the
	edge of the bed beside his books. The light is on, the bed
	still as it was the night before.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Didn't you go to sleep at all,
	          Karl? You been sittin' there like
	          that all night?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, I guess we better hit the
	          road.
	
	INT. FIXIT SHOP - DAY
	
	Woolridge's car pulls into the parking lot. He and Karl get
	out and walk toward the shop.
	
	INT. FIXIT SHOP - DAY
	
	Two men, BILL COX, a large man in his forties, and SCOOTER
	HODGES, a really country-looking guy in his thirties, look up
	from behind the counter as Woolridge and Karl enter.
	Woolridge goes to the counter, Karl stands by the door
	looking at the floor.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to
	          see you. Been a long time.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE
	          Good to see you, Bill. How's
	          everybody doin'?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin'
	          me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put
	          me in the poorhouse. Can't complain
	          other than that. Wouldn't do any
	          good if I did. 
	              (laughs)
	          Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          No, don't guess I do. 
	              (he shakes hands with
	               Scooter who sort of
	               smiles)
	          Scooter, good to meet you. 
	              (Woolridge leans in and
	               gets confidential)
	          This is him, the one I talked to
	          you about on the phone. Now like I
	          said, I'll understand if you get
	          nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie
	          to you now, he did get in that
	          trouble but then he was real young.
	
	                    BILL 
	          I remember it real well. Cut them
	          folks to pieces. His mama one of
	          'em.
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I
	          always wanted to kill him myself.
	          Asshole's what he was. I remember
	          that ol' boy 
	              (points to Karl)
	          too. Kind of retarded or somethin'
	          back in school.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted
	          these days. I don't think he'd ever
	          hurt anybody.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Don't look much like he could. You
	          say he can fix a small engine like
	          nobody's bidness.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He's a regular whiz at it. That's
	          all he did when he was a kid.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, I ain't scared of him workin'
	          here. You know me. I'm a church
	          goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your
	          time's up the Lord's gonna come git
	          you. You seared of him, Scooter?
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          I don't guess. Can he talk?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate
	          it. He needs the job. I don't know
	          what to do with him. He don't have
	          anybody really.
	
	                    BILL 
	          That old man of his still livin'
	          over there on Clark Street I
	          believe.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He won't have anything to do with
	          him. Now you say it's all right for
	          him to stay out here in the back?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Fine with me. If he steals
	          anything, I'll take it out of your
	          pocket anyway.
	
	Bill slaps Woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with
	laughter.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          He won't steal. I'm tellin' you
	          he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps
	          to himself.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, I've got a roomful of work
	          for him to do. Can't get Scooter to
	          do any of it.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Karl, come over here. I want you to
	          meet your new boss. 
	              (Karl obediently shuffles
	               over)
	          This is Bill Cox, runs this place.
	          Says you can work here and stay in
	          the back.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Good to know you, Karl.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Now it's minimal wage and there
	          ain't nothin' but a army cot and a
	          toilet back there.
	
	Karl doesn't say anything.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to
	          the car and get your books.
	
	Woolridge exits. Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl
	stares at the floor.
	
	                    BILL 
	          They say you're a whiz on fixin'
	          lawn mowers and things.
	
	                    KARL
	          I've tinkered around on 'em a
	          little bit.
	
	                    BILL 
	          We order from Dairy Queen at
	          noontime usually. We can buy your
	          lunch till you get on your feet a
	          little.
	
	                    KARL
	          I like them french-fried potaters.
	
	                    BILL 
	              (long pause)
	          Yeah, me too.
	
	                    SCOOTER
	          They make a good double meat
	          burger.
	
	INT. SHOP WORKROOM - NIGHT
	
	The place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed-eaters, and
	other equipment, most of it in pieces. A small cot is in a
	little clearing in the corner by the bathroom. Karl is
	sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while Scooter
	puts some tools away. Bill comes to the door.
	
	                    BILL
	          All right then, I'll see y'all
	          later. Karl you done a good day's
	          work. They right about you.
	          Scooter, he's gonna knock you out
	          of a job if you're not careful.
	          I'll see you tomorrow.
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          Wait up, I'll leave with you and
	          lock up.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Karl, they's a blanket up in under
	          that cot and soap in the bathroom
	          to clean up with. 
	              (pause)
	          Now there's one more thing. The way
	          we lock these doors at night, you
	          can't get out. You didn't want to
	          go anywhere, did you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon.
	
	                    BILL 
	          If it works out and all, maybe
	          we'll get you a key so you can get
	          out at night if you need to. See
	          you later.
	
	They leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. He
	sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. After a
	moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.
	
	INT. SHOP - DAY
	
	It's lunch time and Bill, Scooter, and Karl are sitting in
	folding chairs behind the counter eating from their Dairy
	Queen to-go bags. Karl has french fries.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Scooter, did I tell about the two
	          old boys pissin' off the bridge?
	
	                    SCOOTER 
	          I can't remember.
	
	                    BILL 
	          There was these two old boys hung
	          their peckers off of a bridge to
	          piss, one old boy from California
	          and one old boy from Arkansas.
	          Old boy from California says, "Boy
	          this water's cold." Old boy from
	          Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep
	          too." 
	              (starts wheezing)
	          Get it? That's a goodun.
	
	                    SCOOTER
	              (laughing)
	          Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe
	          you did tell me that one before.
	          I've heard that a bunch. Long time
	          ago.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, yeah it's a classic. You
	          know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about
	          it last night and it's just not
	          Christian of me to not let you have
	          a key. I mean you been in lockup so
	          long, you don't need me keepin' you
	          locked up. You need to come and go
	          as you please. Here, take this key,
	          it'll get you in and out that back
	          door. 
	              (Karl takes the key and
	               keeps eating french
	               fries)
	          Them french fries good?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yeah, they's good all right.
	
	                    BILL 
	          You got any money?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They give me fifty dollars when
	          they turned me loose. I spent up
	          some of it on ridin' the bus and
	          eatin' french-fried potaters.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, I'm gonna pay you today for
	          this comin' week, so you'll have
	          some walkin' around money. When you
	          get off this evenin' you better go
	          buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up
	          supplies to have back there. Some
	          hard candy and some magazines.
	          Somethin' to keep you busy at
	          night.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	                    BILL 
	          I'll let you off while it's still
	          daylight.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Karl is walking down a residential street. He stops in front
	of the house where the boy, Frank, lives and stares at the
	house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares
	at it. A curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the
	window. He comes and opens the door.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Hey there. I thought I heard
	          somebody on the porch. Wasn't your
	          name Karl?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Yeah. What you doin' by here?
	
	                    KARL
	          You told me to come by.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Did you want to play ball with us?
	
	                    KARL
	          I ain't no good at it. I just come
	          by.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to
	          go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar
	          Store. She's workin' two till
	          eight.
	
	                    KARL
	          All right then.
	
	He starts to walk away.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Wait a minute. You want to go with
	          me? You can meet my mama.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't want to worry your mama
	          with company.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's
	          real nice. She'll give us somethin'
	          if we ask her to. Candy or
	          somethin'.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I was kindly needin' to do some
	          tradin'. Reckon they sell
	          toothpaste?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          They sell some of everything. Come
	          on let's go. I won't tell her about
	          you bein' in the state hospital for
	          killin'.
	
	INT. BEN'S DOLLAR STORE - DAY
	
	Frank and Karl make their way through the fairly crowded
	store. It's sort of a mini-version of a Walmart. They find
	Frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red
	Ben's knit shirt. They are laughing together and pricing some
	mouthwash. LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her
	thirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties,
	with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging
	over his belt. They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys
	approach.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Let me guess. You want a bunch of
	          candy and a pop.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          You're gonna rot your teeth that
	          way. But I bet I know what you
	          would like even better.
	          I put potted meat on special, four
	          cans for a dollar and they're not
	          moving very well. I'd sure let a
	          few cans go for free to the right
	          boy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I don't like potted meat. Daddy
	          used to say it was made out of lips
	          and peckers and intestints.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank, don't talk that way. Who's
	          that strange lookin' man behind
	          you? Did he follow you in here?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Can I help you, sir?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the
	          laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama.
	          And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager.
	          He lets mama off any time she feels
	          like it 'cause they're best
	          friends.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Nice to meet you, Karl.
	
	                    KARL
	              (keeping his distance)
	          Pleased to know y'all.
	
	There's an uncomfortable silence.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank come back here with me for a
	          minute.
	
	She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I don't think I've ever seen you
	          before.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw, I don't believe you have. I
	          don't reckon I never been in here.
	          This store didn't used to be here.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          It's been here seventeen years. Did
	          you live here before or something?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I's horned and raised here up till
	          I's twelve year old.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          What brings you back?
	
	                    KARL 
	          What's that you say?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Why are you here now?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They turned me loose from the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Is that right? 
	              (pause)
	          Are you going to be staying here
	          long?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired
	          on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Do you have family here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Not really to speak of.
	
	Linda and Frank return from the back.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you
	          can stay with us. Out in the
	          garage. Our car won't fit in there
	          anyway. It's real neat.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank told me about your situation.
	          And Frank loves company. You know,
	          especially after his daddy passed
	          and all. There ain't no sense in
	          you stayin' in that old greasy
	          shop. 
	              (to Vaughan, hushed)
	          He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	              (hushed)
	          He just got out of the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (put out)
	          I know.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Can we get some candy and pops?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Sure, go ahead.
	
	They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little
	puzzled.
	
	                    VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
	          Are you sure it's safe to let him
	          around that guy?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank's just crazy about him. He
	          likes the way he talks. He helped
	          him carry home the clean laundry.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          He's been in the state hospital a
	          long time, something must be wrong
	          with him.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He's retarded's all. You know he's
	          always after a father figure and
	          Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one
	          with his mean ass.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          What about me?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I don't think he sees you as a guy
	          guy.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	              (wrinkles his brow)
	          Karl is a guy guy?
	
	EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
	
	Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying
	the spoils of their Ben's Dollar Store visit.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          This is what I call my secret place
	          'cause I come out here when I feel
	          like bein' by myself. I used to
	          come here with Karen Cross. She's
	          kind of like my girlfriend, or used
	          to be. She says she likes Jerry
	          Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her
	          back 'cause I love her. We used to
	          come here and hold hands and talk
	          and read books to each other with a
	          flashlight. She didn't want to have
	          anything to do with me in front of
	          other people 'cause I don't have
	          any money. Well, mama and me, I
	          mean. She seemed to like me a whole
	          lot when we were out here though.
	          She said she loved me, too. Out
	          here. Settin' right on that stump
	          you're on. See, her daddy's a
	          dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry
	          Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice
	          plant. Was your folks well off?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough
	          to scrape by on, I reckon.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          They still around, your folks?
	
	                    KARL 
	          My mother's dead. My daddy's
	          s'posed to be around still. He
	          don't want to have nothin' to do
	          with me though.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          How do you know?
	
	                    KARL 
	          He never did want to. I figure he
	          ain't changed his mind much.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          How did your mama die?
	
	                    KARL
	              (long pause)
	          You don't need to know all of that.
	          You're just a boy.
	          You need to think about good
	          thoughts while you're still a boy.
	          They'll be plenty of time for the
	          other.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I've had a lot of bad thoughts
	          since my daddy died. Sometimes I
	          wish I was still real little and he
	          was still here. My mama's real
	          good, but I wish I had both of 'em. 
	              (pause)
	          When we went to Memphis one time in
	          the car, it was rainin' so hard we
	          couldn't see the road. But I wadn't
	          scared because I thought as long as
	          daddy was drivin' nothin' could
	          happen to us. I feel that way about
	          mama now. 
	              (he looks at the ground
	               for a moment)
	          Mama has a boyfriend now. His name
	          is Doyle Hargraves. He works
	          construction so he makes a pretty
	          good livin'. He still don't help
	          mama out with any money though. He
	          ain't no good. He's mean to her. He
	          don't like me at all. Mama says
	          it's because he's jealous I belong
	          to my daddy instead of him. He
	          stays with us all night sometimes,
	          but he's got his own house.
	          Somebody told me it's so he can
	          still have other girlfriends. I
	          like it on the nights when he ain't
	          at our house. I'm not so nervous
	          then.
	
	                    KARL 
	          How come her to keep bein'
	          girlfriends and all with him if
	          he's mean to her?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          She says it's for the times when
	          he's good to her. She's lonely
	          since daddy died. She said
	          sometimes she don't know why. 
	              (pause)
	          He threatened to kill her if she
	          ever left him. My daddy would kill
	          him if he was here and somebody was
	          mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real
	          good to mama. Vaughan that you met.
	          But he's not able to do anything to
	          Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
	          funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
	          to go with men instead of women.
	          That makes him not to be able to
	          fight too good. He sure is nice
	          though. He's from St. Louis. People
	          who are queer can get along better
	          in a big town. He got transferred
	          here to work. But mama said the
	          real reason he left is 'cause his
	          daddy hated him. For bein' the way
	          he is. I wish he liked to go with
	          women. I'd rather him be mama's
	          boyfriend than Doyle.
	
	Pause as Frank looks at the ground again. He seems troubled.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Karl. 
	              (pause)
	          You know when I said daddy got hit
	          by a train.
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me
	          that.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It ain't the truth. He shot hisself
	          with a shotgun on purpose.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Why did he do that, reckon.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          'Cause he didn't have enough money
	          to take care of us the way he
	          wanted to. That's what the letter
	          said. He got laid off from work and
	          had to just work odd jobs. I
	          thought he took care of us fine. 
	              (pause)
	          Karl, did you really kill somebody?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yeah, I did.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Who did you kill?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Two people.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Were they bad people?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I thought they was.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Maybe they needed it.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I growed up and got taught it ain't
	          right to kill nobody.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It's okay if you're lookin' out for
	          yourself. If it's self-defense. Was
	          it self-defense?
	
	Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and
	doesn't answer.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          My daddy was good. I think too many
	          good people die. It ain't right.
	          That's what I think.
	
	INT. SHOP - DAY
	
	Karl is tying the strap around his books. His sack of
	toiletries is on the bed. Bill Cox comes in.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Now, Karl, you sure you want to go
	          stay with these folks? You're
	          welcome to keep on stayin here.
	          It's workin' out real good.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That boy wants me to.
	
	                    BILL 
	          All right then. I'll see you bright
	          and early. How you comin' along on
	          that garden tiller?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty
	          good.
	
	                    BILL 
	          You done fixed it? I'll be damned.
	          Scooter told me it couldn't be
	          fixed.
	          'Course Scooter's about as shitless
	          as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.
	          You done fixed it. I'll just be
	          damned. See you tomorrow.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	DOYLE is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle
	drinking beer. He's in his late thirties and dressed in his
	construction clothes. Linda sits on the arm of the chair and
	Frank stands before them.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, honey, I don't guess I give a
	          shit. I ain't here half the time
	          anyway. If you want a retard livin'
	          in the garage, I don't guess I
	          care. I've got a good tool box and
	          socket set out there I don't want
	          stol'd. I guess I could take it
	          home with me.
	
	                    FRANK
	          He's real honest. He wouldn't steal
	          nothin'.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you,
	          was I? 
	              (pause)
	          Was I?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          No sir.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your
	          mama. This is your mama's decision,
	          not yours. I'm lettin' it go on
	          because she asked me, not you. 
	              (to Linda)
	          Now is this the kind of retard that
	          drools and rubs shit in his hair
	          and all that, 'cause I have trouble
	          eatin' around that kind of thing.
	          Just like I am about antique
	          furniture and midgets. I can't so
	          much as drink a glass of water
	          around a midget or a piece of
	          antique furniture. Same thing with
	          a droolin' retard.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't
	          be that way.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just
	          tellin' the truth. What was he in
	          the nuthouse for?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He's just mentally retarded, I
	          guess.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          He had of went nuts and did
	          somethin'. They don't put you in
	          there for just bein' a retard.
	          They's retards all over the place
	          that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you
	          know, Frank?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I ain't sure.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You might want to find out. He
	          might of hacked his family to
	          pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Yeah, that's right, Frank, you
	          better ask him. I mean, don't hurt
	          his feelin's or anything, but it
	          would be good to know. I'm sure
	          it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You sure are hung up on people
	          bein' sweet. 
	              (takes a long pull on his
	               beer)
	          Speakin' of which, where's your
	          girlfriend? I thought he was comin'
	          by here for something.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He'll be here in a little while,
	          he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Ain't that the sweetest thing. What
	          am I supposed to do about supper
	          with you traipsin' around with that
	          fag?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You're not crippled. Get in there
	          and make somethin'.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Boy, ain't you somethin' else.
	          Talkin' back and everything. It
	          kinda makes me horny when you talk
	          back.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank, why don't you go off and
	          play in your room if Doyle's gonna
	          talk nasty.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I want to watch T.V.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V.
	          Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a
	          family till your retarded friend
	          and your homosexual friend gets
	          here.
	
	EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
	
	Karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books
	staring at the door. After a moment, we hear a car door slam
	and footsteps on the porch. Then we hear Vaughan's voice.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Karl?
	
	Karl turns to face Vaughan.
	
	                    KARL
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          So, you're really going to stay
	          here?
	
	                    KARL
	          That boy wants me to.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Did you knock on the door yet?
	
	                    KARL
	          Naw, I ain't.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          How long have you been standing
	          here?
	
	                    KARL
	          Quite a spell, I reckon.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Listen, before you get very used to
	          staying here, I think you and I
	          need to talk about a few things.
	          Can I take you to lunch?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I done et just a little bit ago.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I mean tomorrow or the next day.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon I can stand to eat a
	          little somethin' or 'nother at
	          noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox
	          generally gets me a box of french
	          fried potaters. But I reckon he can
	          lay off doin' it tomorrow.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and
	          get you at noon.
	
	They stand therefor a moment. Vaughan doesn't really know
	exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After a
	moment, Frank answers the door.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Hey. Y'all come on in.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Vaughan ushers Karl in and they stand behind the sofa. Doyle
	looks up and grins.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Tolerable, I reckon.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (in a hurry to get out)
	          Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.
	          Frank, why don't you and Karl go
	          out in the garage and fix him up a
	          place or play a game or somethin'.
	          Vaughan, you ready to go?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Sure, I guess.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Don't rush ever'body, honey.
	
	She starts to get her things together.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (to Frank)
	          Maybe you and Karl want to go with
	          us?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl
	          got things we need to do.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Hey, Vaughan, you know what I
	          heard? I heard you been puttin' it
	          to Albert Sellers that works over
	          at the funeral home.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I know Albert. We're friends.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I heard you was more than friends.
	          I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all
	          all bowed up and goin' at it in the
	          same room with poor, little, old
	          Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a
	          doornail layed out on a gurney.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          That's ridiculous. That's just a
	          total lie.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Let's go, Vaughan. 
	              (they start for the door)
	          Frank, we'll be back in a little
	          while. I'll bring you back
	          somethin'. You're food's in the
	          oven warmin' over.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          See, you made him somethin'. Hey
	          Vaughan, I was just goin' on with
	          you, jokin' around, buddy.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	              (smiles a little)
	          Yeah, I knew that. You're a card
	          all right.
	
	Linda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to
	          me.
	
	Karl sits on the couch.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Come on, Karl, let's go out to the
	          garage.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man.
	          You set right there, Karl.
	
	Frank leans on the sofa arm beside Karl.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          What's in your bag?
	
	                    KARL
	          This and that. Toothpaste and
	          whatnot.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          What's all them books?
	
	                    KARL
	          Different ones. The Bible's one of
	          'em.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          You believe in the Bible?
	
	                    KARL
	          A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't
	          understand all of it.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, I can't understand none of
	          it. This one begat this one and
	          that one begat this one and begat
	          and begat and begat and lo somebody
	          sayeth some shit or another. Just
	          how retarded are you?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Stop it, Doyle!
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'.
	          The adults are talkin'. Were you in
	          the lockup for cuttin' somebody up
	          with a hatchet?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't never used no hatchet that
	          I remember.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You're just crazy in a retarded
	          kind of way then. 
	              (pause)
	          It wouldn't matter to me if you did
	          do violence on somebody 'cause I
	          ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm
	          afraid for you to stay here. You're
	          just a humped over retard it looks
	          like to me. Not really, I'm just
	          jokin' with you. Welcome to our
	          humble home, buddy. Frank needs all
	          the friends he can get. Frank's a
	          real weak little kid. His daddy
	          taught him how to be a pussy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about
	          daddy, you hear me!
	
	                    DOYLE 
	              (mocking)
	          Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on
	          to the garage and let me be.
	
	Frank is crying now.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Come on, Karl.
	
	They get up and walk away.
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (yelling to Frank)
	          Don't tell your mama we had a
	          little spat. She don't need to be
	          worried with your ass.
	
	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
	
	Karl sits on an old sofa and Frank sits on an upside down
	paint bucket, still upset.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I'd like to kill that son of a
	          bitch. I hate him.
	
	                    KARL
	          You ort not to talk that way.
	          You're just a boy.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Well, I hate him.
	
	                    KARL
	          He ort not to talk that away to you
	          neither. He ain't no count. He's
	          mean to you and your mama. 
	              (pause)
	          Yore mama and that feller that's
	          carryin' me to get somethin'
	          d'eat's gonna be back here
	          directly.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Will you stay here with us for a
	          long time?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon if you want me to. 
	              (pause)
	          I got some of that potted meat and
	          sodie crackers left over if you
	          want some.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I don't see how you can eat that
	          stuff with all those insides it's
	          made out of.
	
	                    KARL
	          I reckon it tastes pretty good to
	          me.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I like the way you talk.
	
	                    KARL
	          I like the way you talk.
	
	Karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight
	as we:
	
	                                        DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. HAMBURGER ESTABLISHMENT - DAY
	
	Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a
	table and they sit and immediately start to eat. After a few
	bites, Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Okay, Karl, the reason I brought
	          you here was to talk to you about
	          something that is on my mind. 
	              (pauses for a response,
	               instead Karl eats french
	               fries and stares at the
	               table)
	          I guess I'll put it right out on
	          the table. Where do I start. Linda
	          and Frank are very important to me.
	          They're like family. My own family
	          was never like family. They're
	          horrible people. As a matter of
	          fact I prayed every night for years
	          that my father would die. I finally
	          realized through a lot of therapy
	          that I was wasting my energy on
	          hating him. Now I just don't care. 
	              (pause)
	          You see, you and I are a lot alike,
	          strange as that may seem. I mean
	          not physically or even mentally
	          really, just well, maybe
	          emotionally or actually the hand
	          we've been dealt in life. We're
	          different. People see us as being
	          different anyway. You're -- well
	          you have your affliction or
	          whatever and I, well mine's not as
	          easy to see. I'm just going to say
	          it. I'm gay. 
	              (watts)
	          Does that surprise you? 
	              (watts)
	          That I'm gay. You know what being
	          gay is, don't you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon not.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Well that's a very offensive way to
	          put it. You shouldn't say that. You
	          were taught that, weren't you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I've heard it said that way.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Anyway, it's hard to live gay,
	          that's the right way to say it, in
	          a small town like this. I've wanted
	          to leave many times, but my love
	          for Linda and Frank and another
	          certain person that we won't go
	          into have kept me from it. Anyway,
	          I'm rambling. If you're going to
	          live in the Wheatly garage you need
	          to know that it won't be easy.
	          Doyle is a monster. Not just a
	          closed minded redneck, but a
	          monster. A dangerous person. I've
	          told Linda that one day that man is
	          going to really hurt her or that
	          boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
	          see it in his eyes. I'm very in
	          tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
	          will make your life hell. You're a
	          perfect target. When I first saw
	          you I was afraid of you. Not really
	          afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
	          But also, I felt a real sensitive
	          feeling from you. And for some
	          reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
	          like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
	          didn't mean it like that. In a good
	          way. Anyway, I just want you to
	          know what you're in for. I have a
	          good feeling about you. You're good
	          for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
	          have an adult friend on a child's
	          level.
	          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a
	          bad way.
	              (pause)
	          There's one more thing. It's none
	          of my business why you were in the
	          state hospital. Everyone has
	          something in their past, maybe you
	          tried suicide, maybe you did
	          something -- terrible. But what I
	          see before me is a gentle, simple
	          man. All I want you to promise me
	          is that you're capable of being
	          around Linda and Frank. You know.
	          You would never hurt them under any
	          circumstances, would you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I wouldn't never hurt them.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          That's what I thought. I hope I
	          haven't offended you in any way.
	          You seem like a thinker. You seem
	          to always be in deep thought. Tell
	          me something. What are you thinking
	          right now?
	
	Karl looks up and stares for a moment.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I was thinkin' I could use me
	          another helpin' of these potaters.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Oh. How about before that?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Before that I was thinkin' it'd be
	          good if I could get another three
	          or four cans of that potted meat if
	          you got any extry.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Linda, Frank, and Doyle are eating.
	
	                    LINDA
	          How come Karl won't eat here with
	          us?
	
	                    FRANK
	          I don't know. He just said he'd eat
	          out there.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
	
	                    LINDA
	          I just feel sorry for the poor
	          thing.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Who could eat with him settin'
	          there makin' that goddamn racket
	          with his throat.
	
	                    LINDA
	          He does make some funny noises.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I sure like the way he talks. It
	          sounds like a race car motor
	          idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
	
	                    LINDA
	          I'm glad of it, honey.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          What have you got to be nervous
	          about? You're a damn kid. You ain't
	          got any bills to pay or bidness to
	          run or old lady to stay on your ass
	          all the time.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I get nervous, that's all I know.
	
	They eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where
	this conversation could lead and know when to leave well
	enough alone.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know what, by God?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          What?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know what we ought to do
	          tonight?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Please Doyle, don't.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Have a damn party! Call Morris and
	          them and get the band together and
	          just party our asses off. I'd like
	          to show that fuckin' Karl to the
	          guys. They'd get a kick out of
	          that. Don't you know they would.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not
	          up for it. They always stay till
	          mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You don't have to do anything but
	          pour some potato chips in a bowl
	          and bring beers out when we get
	          low.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Last time you got mad and run
	          Morris and them off and said to
	          stay away from here.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          That ain't none of your damn
	          bidness. Besides that's the way
	          friends do one another. Fuck it,
	          I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find
	          my guitar, I think it's out there
	          in the garage with that loony tune.
	
	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
	
	Karl sits on his cot eating from the plate Frank brought him.
	Frank and Linda come through the door. Frank comes and sits
	beside Karl. Linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and
	comes over and stands in front of Karl.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Karl, now listen, there's gonna be
	          a party tonight here at the house.
	          Doyle's invited his music-playin'
	          buddies over to make a bunch of
	          racket out on the patio.
	
	                    FRANK
	          They ain't even no good. The only
	          one can play is Randy
	          Horsefeathers. He claims he's an
	          Indian. His real name's Randy
	          Collins and he works at the feed
	          mill. He can at least play guitar.
	
	                    LINDA
	          He's no more an Indian than I am
	          though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try
	          and tease you and be mean to you to
	          show off to his friends. Just like
	          he does to Frank and me sometimes.
	          You just ignore it. Or stay out
	          here away from 'em if he'll let
	          you. He's an okay guy till he gets
	          drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
	          I guarantee it.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          He ain't ever okay to me.
	
	The garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really
	happy.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, it's on! We're gonna rock.
	          Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to
	          get over here. I'd like him to be
	          here. I owe him a good time.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to
	          come to a party with you.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done
	          called him. He'll be here. 
	              (grins)
	          Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I
	          need you to help me ice down a tub
	          of beer, you and Frank.
	
	INT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
	
	White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. Karl
	sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground
	alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda. The "band" is set up on
	the patio. The band consists of MORRIS, a heavyset guy in a
	military uniform on tambourine, TERENCE, a skinny guy in a
	wheelchair on bass, RANDY, a long haired younger guy who's
	not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't
	play and MONTY "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a ZZ
	Top beard on drums. A tub of beer is in front of them.
	They're all hooting and hollering and drinking. They've
	obviously been at it for a while. Doyle steps forward to
	address the 'crowd.'
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Okay ladies and gentlemen 
	              (points to Vaughan)
	          or both. It's come to the time in
	          our show when we like to introduce
	          the band. Over here on lead guitar
	          Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on
	          hit a hot lick, Randy. 
	              (Randy plays a lick)
	          Well, come on, y'all are supposed
	          to clap now. Come on! 
	              (they clap a little except
	               for Karl)
	
	ANGLE ON LINDA
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Karl, you better clap your hands or
	          he'll just keep on.
	
	Karl claps his hands a little.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          On the bass, give it up for Terence
	          "One Ball" Atkins. 
	              (more half-assed clapping)
	          On the tambourine and lyrics Morris
	          Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the
	          group. 
	              (claps)
	          On drums "The Johnson." 
	              (claps)
	          And last and most importantly,
	          Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar
	          and business affairs and the only
	          motherfucker with a truck big
	          enough to haul this outfit on the
	          next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a
	          big hand for these guys. They're
	          workin' their asses off here. 
	              (pauses for a slug of
	               beer)
	          Okay I'd like to dedicate this next
	          one to some very special people in
	          our audience tonight. To my lovely
	          female companion Linda, her lovely
	          son Frank, our new boarder Karl -
	          what's your last name Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Childers.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Karl Childers just in from the
	          state facility. Make one of them
	          gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it
	          is you do. 
	              (nothing)
	          Oh well, Karl's a little retarded,
	          he don't know what the hell I'm
	          talkin' about. And to Vaughan who
	          fucks a mortician in the rear
	          entrance right in front of his
	          clients. Now that takes balls. Our
	          number one tune for the folks,
	          boys. Kick it off Johnson!
	
	They play "Walk Don't Run" while the audience of four sits in
	motionless silence. They finish the song and hoot and holler
	and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          You like that Vaughan?
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Sure. It sounded like a number one
	          tune all right.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You enjoying yourself, Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	We hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near
	distance.
	
	                    VOICE (O.S.) 
	          I wished you all would lay off for
	          tonight. I can't hear myself think
	          for that racket. It's nighttime,
	          now let folks be! I'll call the
	          law!
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (hollers back)
	          I told you already three times, the
	          laws on my side. I play cards with
	          J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police.
	          Get fucked you old bastard! 
	              (to the party)
	          Okay now, Linda, you and the kid
	          clean up and get a tarpaulin over
	          this instruments. Me and the boys
	          are goin' to the county line.
	          We're out of liquor and beer. Come
	          on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin'
	          with us.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I'd better go on home now, it's
	          late. I have to work tomorrow.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Come on, don't be a pussy.
	          Everybody has to work.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          He don't want to Doyle. Don't go
	          Vaughan if you don't want to.
	          You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (very sincere)
	          But honey, I'll be good. I promise.
	          I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin'
	          to help these two be part of
	          things.
	
	INT. DOYLE'S TRUCK - NIGHT
	
	Doyle is driving, Vaughan in the middle, and Karl by the
	window. Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
	tape. The first few notes of "Ghost Riders in the Sky" play.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Are you sure you can drive? You've
	          really had a lot of alcohol.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
	
	They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song
	goes louder.
	
	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
	
	The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the
	"band" in the back of the truck trying to control Terence's
	wheelchair as it rolls back and forth.
	
	INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (points to tape player)
	          Not that you afflicted sons of
	          bitches would know anything about
	          it, but this is art.
	
	They are stopped by a red traffic light. A police car pulls
	up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on
	the passenger side and turns down the music.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I
	          seen your pitcher in the paper for
	          catchin' that big-ass bass.
	
	                    FREDDY 
	          Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't
	          drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FREDDY 
	          I figured that. Well you better be
	          careful with that cripple in the
	          back. You'll throw him out. Looks
	          like you got a wagonful.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          We run outta somethin' to drink.
	          Goin' to the county line. You want
	          to race?
	
	                    FREDDY
	              (laughing)
	          You know better than that. We're on
	          duty. Catch me in that Camaro next
	          week one night.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Catch you later Freddy!
	
	Doyle peels out and the music blares again.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          I bet you like sittin' between two
	          men in a dual wheel truck don't
	          you?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Sarcastic right? 
	              (pause)
	          You know the boys in the band are
	          probably gonna stay over tonight.
	          We'd be glad to have you.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
	Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
	are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
	room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really
	stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
	strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue,
	which has obviously been going on for awhile.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow
	          me on those particular points, but
	          it's not really important in the
	          smaller picture, which is where
	          most people dwell anyway. Not that
	          being manager of Ben's Dollar Store
	          is insignificant. Or that making it
	          through years of incarceration in a
	          state supported facility is any
	          small feat.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          Morris, he's the only one in the
	          band that went to college.
	
	                    RANDY
	          I'm in junior college right now
	          over in Westfield.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          That ain't no college, that's trade
	          school. Auto repair ain't ever made
	          a genius out of nobody.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Holidays are for campers.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          What do you know about bein' a
	          genius, Johnson. You can't even
	          hardly keep a steady beat on that
	          high-price drum set.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          I think y'all play really tight
	          together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't
	          throw off on one another.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Anything that has to be discussed
	          can't mean anything.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You got that shit right.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          What exactly do you mean by that? I
	          don't understand.
	
	                    MORRIS
	          Exactly the point, my young
	          levelheaded friend.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I don't get it.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          I rest my case.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          Morris is real smart with
	          philosophies and things. That's why
	          him and me are the songwriting team
	          of our group. I make up good tunes
	          or melodies as we call them and
	          Morris is the lyrics.
	
	                    MORRIS
	          Not unlike Gary Brooker of the
	          Protocol Harum.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          We don't ever play any songs that
	          y'all wrote. I never even heard one
	          of 'em. Y'all just talk.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          We don't even play any songs with
	          words at all that I remember. We
	          ain't got no fuckin' microphone. Or
	          speaker set up.
	
	                    TERENCE
	          We wrote one last night standin'
	          outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it
	          "Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."
	          Then, you know, like on country
	          songs in parenthesis it says "There
	          is usually someone in the trunk." I
	          came up with a tune just humming.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          See Vaughan, you shouldn't question
	          a genius. Morris is a modern day
	          poet like in the old days.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          Our latest composition is as
	          follows: entitled: 
	          "The Thrill" --
	          "I stand on the hill 
	          Not for a thrill 
	          but for a breath 
	          of a fresh kill 
	          Never mind the man 
	          who contemplates 
	          doing away with license plates 
	          He stands alone anyway 
	          Baking the cookies of discontent 
	          By the heat of a laundrymat vent
	          Leaving his soul" 
	          (Then like in poetry I have dot dot
	          dot then drop down to the next line
	          kind of off center.)
	          "Leaving his soul parting waters
	          Under the medulla oblongata 
	          of (then dot dot dot again)
	          mankind."
	
	Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
	something other than Morris.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          I don't think that's right. I
	          believe dot dot dot come between
	          medulla and oblongata or something
	          like that. 
	              (Morris stares at him)
	          Well it did. It wadn't before
	          mankind, I know that much.
	
	                    MORRIS 
	          The dots are where I say they are.
	          Melody and tune. That's your trade.
	          You're a tunesmith Terence.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          I don't really understand the
	          meaning of the words.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go
	          out of my mind. And plus you're
	          liable to bust a spring in Karl's
	          head. He's already off balance.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          That wadn't the way you made it up
	          before, Morris. That's all I know.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          We don't need fancy words, we need
	          to practice. We don't ever
	          rehearse.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON 
	          We need some payin' gigs instead of
	          just messin' around on first one
	          patio and then another'n.
	
	                    RANDY 
	          Morris, you should just be the
	          manager, you can't play nothin'
	          anyway.
	
	Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
	window. He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
	madman in a flash.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all
	          just shut the fuck up! We don't
	          need no practicin' or managers
	          cause we ain't no fuckin' band!
	          Morris ain't no genius and the rest
	          of you are just losers. Am I the
	          only one sane human bein' around
	          here? Just get the hell out of my
	          house and don't come back!
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          It's not your house, Doyle, it's
	          Linda's.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!
	          You mind your own business. Now get
	          out! Now, before I get too mad to
	          turn back.
	
	                    TERENCE 
	          What about our instruments?
	
	Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes
	him right out the screen door. We hear the chair clatter down
	the steps and a cry of pain from Terence.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Now!
	
	They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit
	frozen on the sofa.
	
	                    THE JOHNSON
	              (turning back)
	          You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's
	          wrong with you. Nobody needs your
	          shit.
	
	                    MORRIS
	              (stops at the door)
	          The dots just look good on paper.
	          You don't sing 'em anyway. You're
	          showing your true Aries colors now.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Get out of my goddamn face, you
	          fuckin' buzzard!
	
	He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the
	sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in
	the doorway.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          I thought I told everybody to get
	          out of my house. That includes
	          cocksuckers and retards. Get off
	          your asses and go.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          This is not your house, Doyle. This
	          is my house and I'll say who stays
	          and goes. You've got a house, why
	          don't you go get one of your
	          girlfriends and go home to it.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know better than to talk like
	          that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make
	          me knock the piss out of you.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Doyle, don't you lay one hand on
	          her.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          That's funny. 
	              (to Linda)
	          You go to bed and take snot nose
	          with you.
	
	Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets
	up also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You're not stayin' here tonight. Go
	          get sober before you come back. I'm
	          tired of my child seein' this. Now
	          you get yourself straight or I'll
	          lock your ass out of my life for
	          good.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You know what I told you, you even
	          think of leavin' me, I'll kill you
	          dead as a doornail.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          That might be better than this.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          I'm a witness. I heard you threaten
	          her life.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          I thought I told you to keep out!
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Leave.
	
	                    DOYLE
	              (an inch from her face)
	          Don't tell me what to do.
	
	She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
	face. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes
	wild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty
	cans, bottles, a lampstand.
	He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to
	the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost
	pitiful.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
	          Everything's botherin' me, that's
	          all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I hate you!
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, I hate you, too. No I don't.
	          I love your mama. Nobody
	          understands what I go through. I'll
	          leave. You bunch of freaks have
	          fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey.
	          I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass,
	          really. 
	              (to Frank)
	          You ever hit me again you little
	          bastard and I'll make you sorry
	          your daddy ever squirted your
	          little ass out.
	
	He leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as
	does Vaughan.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You all right, Mama?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and
	          forget about tonight.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We don't need to think bad
	          thoughts, do we Mama?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          No, honey, we don't. 
	              (pause)
	          I'll make some coffee and start
	          cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you
	          want some coffee, huh?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me
	          nervous when I drink it.
	
	                                        DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Linda cleaning up the last of the mess. Frank comes in sleepy
	eyed in his pajamas.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          What are you doin' up again, Frank?
	          You need to get a little sleep.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Did Vaughan go home?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Yeah, he has to go to work in a
	          little while. I do too.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Did Karl go to bed?
	
	                    LINDA
	          I guess. He went to the garage.
	          Poor thing, he's probably never
	          seen such a crazy mess. He probably
	          wants to go back and live in Mr.
	          Cox's shop.  
	
	                    FRANK
	          I bet he don't. Karl likes me. 
	
	                    LINDA
	          I know he does.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Mama?
	
	                    LINDA
	          Huh?
	
	                    FRANK
	          Is everything gonna be all right
	          someday? I just stay nervous all
	          the time just about. 
	
	                    LINDA
	          Yeah, honey, someday everything's
	          gonna be all right.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Doyle wouldn't really kill you,
	          would he?
	
	                    LINDA
	          I promise we're gonna get away from
	          him. The time has to be right,
	          that's all. I'd rather him get
	          tired of me and leave me. Then he
	          wouldn't want to hurt me. He
	          wouldn't care then. We'll be fine.
	          I promise. You go to bed now. 
	              (she hugs him)
	          I love you.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I love you, too, Mama.
	
	He goes to his room.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and
	sits at the table. After a moment, she looks up and is
	startled to see Karl in the doorway.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You scared me.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I didn't aim to.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Want to sit down? Did you need
	          somethin'?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No ma'am.
	
	Karl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          Two fellers was on a bridge a
	          takin' a leak and one feller says
	          the water was cold and the other
	          said it was deep water. One of 'em
	          came from Arkansas, I believe.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (puzzled)
	          I'll be dog.
	
	More silence.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Do you reckon you can make me some
	          biscuits?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Right now?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Just whenever you take a notion to.
	          I don't aim to put you out.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well, it is nearly breakfast time
	          anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have
	          to be at work in three hours. You
	          know how it is when you just sleep
	          an hour or two, you feel worse than
	          if you hadn't slept at all?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well, set down and I'll make some
	          biscuits and gravy.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Mustard's good on 'em to me.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Okay.
	
	Karl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          It's all right. 
	              (pause)
	          You know I was thinkin' there's
	          this girl that works with me. She's
	          real heavy, but she's cute in the
	          face. Well, you know, she's slow.
	          She's a little bit, I think. She's
	          not retarded, just -- it don't
	          matter, listen to me. I thought you
	          might like to meet her. Vaughan
	          wants to have a little supper over
	          at his house and we could invite
	          her. Would you like that?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Vaughan's "friend" will be there,
	          too. He works at the funeral home.
	          And Frank. You know Frank likes you
	          a lot. He says you make him feel
	          calm.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me
	          and him's made friends.
	
	She keeps working.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          Hit ain't right for me to keep from
	          tellin' you how come me to be put
	          in the state hospital.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          That's okay. It's not really my
	          business. I have wondered though.
	          Why was it? Was it like a nervous
	          breakdown?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I killed my mother and a old boy
	          name Jesse Dixon. I thought they
	          was a-doin' wrong. I was about your
	          boy's age. They say I'm well now
	          from it.
	
	Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but
	not as much as you would think.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Was that you? I remember that. I
	          was only three or four, but I
	          always heard about it growin' up. 
	              (pause)
	          They say you're well?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am. 
	              (pause)
	          I like your garage. 
	              (pause)
	          I wouldn't never hurt you or your
	          boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible
	          and say the same thing.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I believe you. I really do.
	
	EXT. COVS PARKING LOT - DAY
	
	Bill Cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man.
	Bill is trying to crank it up, but it won't start. A car
	pulls into the parking lot and Gerry Woolridge gets out of it
	and comes over to Bill.
	
	                    BILL 
	          How 'bout you, Jerry.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          How are you, Bill?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Doin' pretty good. Got a sick
	          tiller here. What's got you down
	          this way?
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Just thought I'd check on Karl and
	          see if everything's working out.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for
	          them rackets and breathin' things
	          he does. Ain't threatened me with a
	          killin' or anything. 
	              (laughs)
	          But boy you couldn't of been more
	          right about him fixin' things. That
	          son of a bitch is a regular Eli
	          Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves
	          french fries. Eats four larges and
	          don't even so much as belch. I'm
	          proud to have him.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Is him stayin' here workin' out?
	
	                    BILL 
	          He's gone to stayin' over with that
	          Wheatley boy and his mama in their
	          garage. I think that little boy
	          adopted him damn near like a
	          mascot. But he's got a key here to
	          come and go as he pleases.
	          Everything's worked out good.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Can I see him?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Sure.
	
	Bill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on
	new mowers in the front window.
	
	                    BILL (CONT'D)
	          Scooter! Run get Karl for me.
	
	EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
	
	Woolridge and Karl lean on the hood of Woolridge's car. In
	the background, Bill and the old man tinker with the tiller.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Are you sure you're okay staying
	          with that woman and boy?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Do they know about you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          My history.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I told 'em about it. They know I'm
	          well. That Mizz Wheatley made me
	          some biscuits.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I'll be.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That boy, he's my friend. He likes
	          the way I talk and I like the way
	          he talks.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I knew you'd do all right. Well, I
	          just wanted to check on you. I'll
	          say bye to Bill and get on back.
	
	They walk over to Bill.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Karl, see if you can figure out
	          what's wrong with this thing. It
	          won't crank up and ever'thing seems
	          to be put together right.
	
	Karl squats beside the tiller.
	
	                    WOOLRIDGE 
	          I'll see you, Bill.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Okay, stop back by. Don't worry
	          about your boy here, he's doin'
	          good.
	
	Karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Hit ain't got no gas in it.
	
	                    BILL 
	          See there. Thinks of the simplest
	          thing first.
	
	INT. VAUGHAN'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Vaughan, ALBERT the "friend," Linda, Frank, Karl, and
	MELINDA, the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table. Karl
	and Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly
	picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat.
	This goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns
	to Karl.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          So Karl, do you intend to stay in
	          the lawnmower business for a while
	          or do you have other plans?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I think Karl is going to be a
	          writer or a librarian eventually.
	          You should see all the books he
	          has. He must read constantly.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't read 'em yet except two or
	          three of 'em. I can't understand a
	          lot of what I try to read. My mind,
	          hit wonders off to somethin' else
	          when I try to read.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          I'm the same way. Of course, in my
	          line of work, I stay too busy to
	          read.
	          But at least I have job security.
	          People may stop doing a lot of
	          things, but one thing is for sure,
	          they won't stop dying.
	
	                    LINDA
	              (looks at Frank)
	          Why don't we talk about something a
	          little more festive.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Does everyone like the food?
	
	Nods and yeses.
	
	                    VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
	          Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm
	          a good cook.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda
	          was voted employee of the month at
	          the Dollar Store last February.
	          Isn't that somethin'?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am, I reckon.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Well, when you like pricing items
	          as much as I do, I guess it's just
	          bound to happen sooner or later.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Karl, maybe you and Melinda might
	          want to take a walk or something
	          after dinner. It's a nice night.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Vaughan, don't get pushy.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                    KARL
	          I like walkin' quite a bit from
	          time to time.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          I stay on my feet all the time at
	          work. I just can't find shoes
	          that's comfortable.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          Hospital shoes might be the answer.
	          Nurses' shoes.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Or the kind old ladies who work in
	          the school cafeteria wear.
	
	                    ALBERT 
	          Same difference.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          I get real mean when my feet hurt.
	          It's the only time I don't like
	          checkin' out the customers, when my
	          feet hurt.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin'
	          much, you boys must really like
	          that food.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I just don't have anything to say
	          about shoes.
	
	Silence for a moment.
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Listen everybody, I know this may
	          sound corny, I've had a few glasses
	          of wine and that kind of makes me a
	          little emotional, but I'm going to
	          say it anyway. It just came over me
	          in a rush. I want you all to know
	          that I care about each and every
	          one of you at this table.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          That's very sweet of you Vaughan.
	          We care about you, too. Don't we
	          y'all?
	
	Nods, grunts, "Sure do's."
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Also, Melinda, please don't tell
	          anybody at the store that Albert
	          was here tonight, okay.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Why?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Well, a lot of people in town talk
	          and spread cruel rumors.
	          Unfortunately, I have to keep
	          certain parts of my life private.
	
	                    MELINDA
	          You mean about y'all bein' together
	          in "that" way?
	
	                    VAUGHAN 
	          Yes.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          I think everybody at the store
	          knows that already. They always
	          talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter
	          told a awful story about why you
	          ain't allowed over at the First
	          Baptist Church no more.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Karl, why don't you and Melinda go
	          take a walk. It's nice out.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	He gets up and walks toward the front door. Melinda gets up
	and tries to catch up.
	
	EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
	
	Karl and Melinda are walking in the moonlight. It seems a
	little hard for Melinda to keep up.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          You walk fast, don't you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	They walk a little farther in silence.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          These is the worst shoes I own for
	          walkin'. How far did you want to
	          go?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I ain't really thought about it too
	          much I don't reckon.
	
	They walk until they disappear into the darkness.
	
	INT. COX'S SHOP - DAY
	
	Karl is on the floor working on a mower with Scooter, they
	are ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things. Bill Cox
	appears in the door.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Hey Karl, they's somebody out here
	          to see you. Some gal holding a nice
	          bouquet. 
	              (Karl doesn't move)
	          Come on now, she wants to talk to
	          you. Don't just set there.
	
	Karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter.
	Melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a
	cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. Nobody
	says anything for a moment.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These
	          was on sale 'cause they're not
	          fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus
	          my ten percent employee discount.
	          Since I didn't bring you anything
	          to our date last night, I thought
	          you'd like to have 'em.
	
	She hands them to him.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Scooter, let's me and you go over
	          to Dairy Queen and pick up a few
	          things for lunchtime.
	
	                    SCOOTER
	          I can go. You don't have to. You
	          don't never go.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon
	          my language, ma'am.
	
	They start to leave. At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at
	Karl. They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the
	counter. They are silent for a while.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Well, I just thought I'd give you
	          them. I liked walkin' with you. I
	          got a blister the size of a quarter
	          on one heel. Well, I'll see you
	          sometime, I guess.
	
	She walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say
	something.
	
	                    KARL 
	          A blister shore can hurt.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL
	          Flowers is pretty. I've always
	          thought that.
	
	                    MELINDA 
	          Me, too.
	
	She leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers
	and watches her walk away.
	
	EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK
	
	Holding the flowers, Karl is walking down the sidewalk toward
	the Wheatley house when he sees Frank coming out the front
	door with a book and a flashlight. He sees Karl.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Hey Karl, you off work?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Where'd you get them flowers?
	
	                    KARL
	          That gal that made employee of the
	          month give 'em to me for awalkin'
	          with her.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I was goin' to the secret place. I
	          borried one of your books to take
	          down there. You ain't mad, are you?
	
	                    KARL
	          Naw. You can look at all my books
	          you want to.
	
	                    FRANK
	          It's name's A Christmas Carol.
	
	                    KARL
	          That's than un on Christmas I was
	          tellin' you about.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You want to go with me?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	EXT. SECRET PLACE - NIGHT
	
	Karl and Frank sit in the clearing, Karl on the stump, Frank
	on the ground. Frank is shining the flashlight on the book.
	He finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a
	          while.
	
	                    KARL
	          All right then.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Boy, folks sure had it rough back a
	          long time ago, didn't they?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like
	          to tore me up when I read about
	          that pore little cripple boy.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Yeah, me too. 
	              (pause)
	          That was nice of that woman to give
	          you them flowers.
	
	                    KARL
	          Hit was right thoughty of her.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
	
	                    KARL 
	          All right then.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You know that girl I told you
	          about. The one I love.
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah, I recollect it.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Would you go see her with me? I
	          kind of thought I might take her
	          some flowers like that woman done
	          you.
	
	                    KARL
	          If you want me to.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I ain't got no money to get 'em
	          with but I bet Vaughan will let me
	          have some of them flowers at the
	          store.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I bet he will. I got a little money
	          if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I usually get run off by her mama
	          or daddy if they're home. Reckon
	          why they don't like me?
	
	                    KARL 
	          They ort to. You're a good boy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean
	          I don't love her.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          And I don't try to touch her. You
	          know, in a bad way. Foolin' around,
	          sex and all.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That's real good. You ort not to if
	          ye ain't married to somebody. Bible
	          tells you that much. Hit tells some
	          things that don't seem right too, I
	          reckon. I guess a feller ort to
	          foller it close as he can, though. 
	              (pause)
	          You don't touch yourself, do you?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          What do you mean?
	
	                    KARL
	          Pull on your works. Your privates.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Oh, jackin' off?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir. You ort not know that
	          language.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I didn't know till here while back
	          a year or two ago when I spent the
	          night with Ronnie Smart one time.
	          He said just tug on your peter and
	          think about your mama. I tried it,
	          but I felt funny thinkin' about my
	          mama. So, I switched over to
	          thinkin' about his mama and then
	          what he told me would happen,
	          happened. It sure tingles, don't
	          it?
	
	                    KARL 
	          You ort not to pull on yourself
	          that away.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I kind of like you tellin' me what
	          to do and not to do. Just like my
	          daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'
	          me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to
	          do. Mama said the only way to ever
	          get away from him is for him to get
	          away from us. That we can't leave
	          him or he'll try and hurt her.
	
	                    KARL 
	          He ain't no count.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You don't seem like a daddy. You
	          seem like a brother. 
	              (pause)
	          Wonder what makes you like somebody
	          right off when you don't even know
	          'em like what happened with me and
	          you.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon I know.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          And then some people you don't like
	          right off. It's funny. 
	              (pause)
	          You know why I want you to play
	          ball with me?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if
	          you ain't no good. It takes your
	          mind off of everything else while
	          you're doin' it. When you run real
	          fast tryin' to make a touchdown you
	          don't think about anything else. I
	          ain't no good, but my daddy always
	          said he was proud of me when I
	          threw a ball or ran with it. Did
	          you have any brothers and sisters
	          growin' up to play with?
	
	                    KARL
	          I had one there for little bit. Hit
	          didn't get old enough to play with.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Why not? It died?
	
	                    KARL
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Why?
	
	                    KARL
	          Hit was borned a little too early
	          on. My mother and father made hit
	          come too early some way or other. I
	          reckon they changed their mind
	          about havin' another'n. I was about
	          six or eight year old then and they
	          didn't care too much for me so I
	          reckon they didn't need somethin'
	          else to worry 'em with.
	
	                    FRANK
	          So it died when it come out?
	
	                    KARL
	          My daddy come to the shed out back
	          and got me and said throw this here
	          away and handed me a towel with
	          somethin' in it. I went for the
	          trash barrel there and opened up
	          the towel to see 'cause they was a
	          noise and somethin' movin' in it.
	          Hit was bloody-like around that
	          towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty
	          baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It was alive?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir. Right then it was.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          A boy or girl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          A little ol' boy.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You threw it in a trash barrel?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I didn't feel right about doin'
	          that. I takened a shoe box from
	          there in the shed and emptied out
	          some screwdrivers and nuts and
	          warshers from it and put the little
	          feller in that and buried him in
	          the corner of the yard there. That
	          seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          It was still alive when you buried
	          it?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I heared it cryin' a little through
	          that box.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          That don't seem right. It seems
	          like you should have kept him alive
	          and took care of him if he was your
	          brother.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon
	          I didn't know what to do. I didn't
	          know how to care for no baby. Mama
	          and Daddy didn't want him. They
	          learned me to do what they told me
	          to. These days I figure it might of
	          been best to give him right back to
	          the Good Lord right off the bat
	          anyhow.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          That makes me feel real sad.
	          Couldn't you have done somethin',
	          Karl? I would have. I wish I would
	          of had him. He'd be here right now.
	          Livin'.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Hits been hard thinkin' about it.
	          They ain't a day goes by I don't
	          think about it. I kindly have a
	          picture of it up in my head that I
	          see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have
	          bad thoughts on it. I wished they
	          was somethin' I could of did, too.
	          Shouldn't no bad things happen to
	          childern. All the ol' bad things
	          ort to be saved up for folks that's
	          growed up, the way I see it. I
	          shouldn't of told you about that. A
	          boy ort not hear about such things.
	          It just kindly come out.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I didn't mean to say anything bad
	          about you. I know you're good. You
	          didn't mean no harm. 
	              (pause)
	          Did you ever think about killin'
	          yourself on purpose like my daddy
	          did?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I've studied about it. The Bible
	          says not to or you end up goin' to
	          Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I
	          call it Hades.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Bible says the same thing about
	          killin' others, too.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir, I reckon it does.
	
	EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
	
	Frank, flowers in hand, and Karl approach a very nice two
	story house. They get to the door and Frank rings the
	doorbell.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I always get nervous when I hear
	          that doorbell. I'm okay just
	          walkin' over, but somethin' about
	          that dang doorbell. They have one
	          room where you can't walk on the
	          carpet or sit on the furniture. I
	          don't see much sense in havin' it.
	
	The door opens and we see an older black lady, the
	HOUSEKEEPER.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER
	              (eyes Karl)
	          Son, I don't know why you keep
	          comin' over here. You know these
	          folks don't want you here. They run
	          you off ever' time. Don't keep
	          doin' this to yourself. You a sweet
	          boy. Now go give them flowers to
	          somebody that'll enjoy 'em.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Ma'am, I really want to give them
	          to Karen.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER
	              (to Karl)
	          You his daddy?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No ma'am.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER 
	          Well, whoever you are, you ought to
	          talk some sense into him. That
	          little old girl is way too fast for
	          him and don't wanna see him no way.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Will you get her for me. Please. I
	          really want to see her.
	          She'll want to see me, too, 'cause
	          we're not in public. Just don't
	          tell her folks I'm here.
	
	                    HOUSEKEEPER
	              (sighs)
	          Okay.
	
	She disappears and a moment later KAREN appears. She's
	thirteen, pretty and very neatly dressed.
	
	                    KAREN
	              (put out)
	          Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming
	          over here. My parents really don't
	          want you to.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I wanted to bring you some flowers.
	          They're pretty good ones.
	
	                    KAREN 
	          They're from the Dollar Store. I'm
	          not an idiot. Besides we have a
	          garden full of flowers.
	
	She eyes Karl.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I wanted for you to meet Karl, too.
	          He's my new friend. But I feel like
	          I've always known him. I thought
	          you should meet him.
	
	                    KAREN 
	          Why? Hi, Karl.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          He's gonna be around a lot and I
	          hope you are too, so...
	
	                    KAREN 
	          Here give me the flowers, I'll do
	          something with them. Thank you. Now
	          you better go. Maybe I'll see you
	          down at the secret place one day in
	          a week or two or something. I have
	          a boyfriend now you know. And we're
	          pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
	
	She proudly displays the ring.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Can you go there with us now? Me
	          and Karl. We could just hang out.
	          Karl has some cool books.
	
	                    KAREN 
	          Frank, I just like you as a friend.
	          Only at the secret place. Okay? I
	          can't go there now. I'll see you
	          later.
	
	                    FRANK
	          But maybe just for awhile -- 
	
	                    KAREN 
	          I'm closing the door now. I told
	          you, I'll see you later.
	
	She closes the door. They stand therefor a moment, then walk
	away down the sidewalk.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          She said she'd see me later. That's
	          kinda good, right?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I reckon.
	
	EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - DAY
	
	Frank and Karl walk up the steps to the house. Frank opens
	the door and they enter.
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY
	
	As Frank and Karl enter, they see Doyle sitting on a
	footstool facing Linda who's in a chair. Doyle is holding
	both her hands and talking very softly to her. He sees the
	guys and looks up.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, I'll be damned, there's the
	          boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I
	          wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was
	          just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell,
	          I'll just start over, set down you
	          boys.
	
	They do, on the couch.
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Well, what it is is, I just, well I
	          took off work early today and your
	          mama was good enough to do the same
	          so we could talk. I guess you'd say
	          I'm really here to apologize, which
	          ain't easy for me to do, about the
	          way I acted the other night. I was
	          just drunk and kinda got a little
	          too worked up and one thing led to
	          another. I care about y'all a lot,
	          I do. I don't mean to be so damned,
	          assholish I guess the word would
	          be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit
	          you, did I? So no apology needed
	          there I guess, but Frank, I'm
	          sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama.
	          I'm just jealous of her. I don't
	          like her life or the way she runs
	          it. I don't like homosexuals and
	          she buddies with one. I don't like
	          little wimpy ass kids or fuckin'
	          mental retards and she's got one of
	          each livin' with her. 
	              (laughs)
	          I was just kiddin'. But really I
	          guess people need to get along even
	          if they have differences. 
	              (pause)
	          You see, I work construction. I
	          build things. Do you realize how
	          important that is to the world. I
	          have a lot of pressure on me. The
	          upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot
	          more time over here and we're gonna
	          get along. Like a family should. 
	              (to Linda)
	          I may even surprise you one day and
	          pop the question. 
	              (he gets up)
	          Well, I'm goin' back to work. I
	          just wanted to give y'all some
	          little piece of happiness today. 
	              (kisses Linda)
	          See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a
	          good boy, Frank.
	
	He leaves.
	
	                    LINDA
	          Well, at least he's tryin'. But who
	          knows for how long.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do
	          better.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I know honey. Just remember what I
	          said, we'll bide our time. You just
	          steer clear of him as much as you
	          can. Doyle's had a real hard life.
	          It's just about run him crazy I
	          think.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We've had a real hard life, too,
	          Mama.
	
	Linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          You're a hell of a boy, Frank.
	          Someday you're gonna get all the
	          good things you deserve. And Karl
	          here's gonna get some more biscuits
	          tonight. What do you think about
	          that?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I could shore use some. Thank ye.
	
	INT. SHOP - DAY
	
	Karl is cleaning some parts in a bucket of gasoline. Bill
	comes to the door.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Hey there Karl, can you come unload
	          a generator for me?
	
	Karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside.
	
	EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
	
	A MAN and a TEENAGE BOY stand by a pickup truck. A small
	generator is on the tailgate.
	
	                    BILL 
	          Karl, lift this thing down and
	          carry it to the back. It's on the
	          blink. 
	              (to man as Karl unloads
	               it)
	          We'll have it for you in a day or
	          two, Walter.
	
	                    WALTER 
	          Y'ont us to he'p you there liftin'
	          that?
	
	                    BILL 
	          Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a
	          bulldozier. Fix anything, too. 
	              (confidentially)
	          He's mentally retarded, but he's a
	          whiz on small engines. Lord works
	          in mysterious ways.
	
	Karl carries the generator toward the shop. He turns and
	watches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill. The
	man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles
	his hair.
	
	                    WALTER 
	          Hell, he didn't just make the team,
	          Coach says he's probably gonna
	          start at end on defense. He's a
	          chip off the old block. Ain't you,
	          Steve?
	
	                    STEVE 
	          I guess so.
	
	Karl turns and goes in the shop.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY GARAGE - DAY
	
	Karl is on his cot reading a book. Frank comes in. He looks
	very depressed. He sits beside Karl.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          What you readin'?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Readin' on this book on how to work
	          carpentry. I aim to learn how to
	          build things out of wood one of
	          these times. I've always been
	          partial to wood buildin's and
	          cabinets and whatnot. These
	          drawin's they got here don't make
	          no sense to me so far. 
	              (he looks directly at
	               Frank, which he seldom
	               does)
	          You seem like yore tails a'draggin'
	          a might. You got somethin' wrong
	          with ye?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Seems like Doyle's wormed his way
	          back in. Mama said he's stayin'
	          over tonight and he's talkin' about
	          movin' in for good. We ain't ever
	          gonna be happy. We'll always be
	          nervous, won't we Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon I know. I ain't
	          found no way yet and I'm three or
	          four times as old as you. Might be
	          that's just the way folks is.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I feel sad about Karen Cross, too.
	          I just make like to myself she
	          loves me. I know better, though. It
	          just feels good to me when I
	          imagine it.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Make believin' always made me feel
	          good too from time to time.
	
	They sit in silence for a moment.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for
	          a Mister Turner tomorrow and a
	          closin' up shop early.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Is that right?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if
	          neither one of us is no count it
	          won't make no difference.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You will? For sure?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We'll be on teams, me and you?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yessir.
	
	EXT. JUNIOR HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
	
	It's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. Karl,
	Frank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up.
	Four boys are lined on defense. They break the huddle and
	come to the line. They are on about the fifty-yard line.
	Frank hikes the ball to one of the boys. He later als it to
	Karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run
	toward him. Then he takes off like the wind. He runs funny,
	kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast. All the others
	are chasing him. Two of the other team's boys catch him on
	about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. Karl
	sees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the
	ball just as Karl bites the dirt. Frank goes into the end
	zone untouched. There are cheers from Frank and the other
	boys. Frank runs over to Karl who's still on the ground.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Way to go, Karl. We got a
	          touchdown. That was a good lateral,
	          man. That was just like the
	          Wishbone.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I dern near had me a touchdown till
	          them boys got a-hold of me there so
	          I figured I better give it off to
	          you. I seen you over there
	          follerin' me.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          We're liable to win if we keep this
	          up. For somebody like you, you sure
	          run fast.
	
	He grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Come on, let's kick off to 'em.
	
	EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
	
	Karl and Frank, dirt, grass stains and all, walk toward home.
	
	                    FRANK
	          I know you could of scored them
	          three touchdowns by yourself
	          instead of throwing 'em over to me.
	
	                    KARL
	          Them boys was tryin' to pull me
	          down pretty hard.
	
	                    FRANK
	          You're strong though. You let me
	          make them touchdowns so I'd feel
	          good. My daddy used to do that kind
	          of thing.
	
	They walk in silence for a moment.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          It don't matter to me about us
	          losin' does it to you?
	
	                    KARL
	          No sir.
	
	                    FRANK
	          It was fun, anyhow.
	
	                    KARL
	          I wadn't thinkin' about nothin'
	          else just like you told me I'd do.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Can we play ever' Saturday?
	
	                    KARL 
	          If I ain't too stove up. I ain't
	          like you. I'm old and give out. 
	              (pause)
	          I'm proud of ye.
	
	INT. GARAGE - DAY
	
	Karl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together, deep in
	thought.
	
	EXT. STREET - DAY
	
	Karl is walking down the street past rundown houses. He comes
	to an old gray woodframe house. It is in bad repair, the
	paint is peeling, the yard is grown up. There is an old
	wooden shed in the back yard. He stands looking at it for a
	moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the
	shed. He's motionless for a moment, then goes inside.
	
	INT. SHED - DAY
	
	Sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood. The shed has
	nothing but dirt for a floor. A few tall patches of grass
	shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers. A few old garden
	tools hang on the wall. In the center is a low circular spot
	in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt.
	Karl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and
	walks out of the shed.
	
	EXT. YARD - DAY
	
	Karl walks across the yard to the house.
	
	INT. SCREENED-IN PORCH - DAY
	
	Karl goes onto the screened-in porch, looks through the
	kitchen window and goes inside.
	
	INT. KITCHEN - DAY
	
	The place is a mess. Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and
	on the table. It's not just clutter, but filth everywhere.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an OLD
	MAN in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap.
	Karl stands facing him for several moments.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm ye boy.
	
	                    OLD MAN 
	          I ain't got no boy.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
	
	                    OLD MAN 
	          I ain't got no boy.
	
	                    KARL 
	          They turned me aloose from the
	          nervous hospital. Said I was well.
	
	No response.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox
	          fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.
	
	No response.
	
	                    KARL (CONT'D)
	          That grass out in the yard's all
	          growed up. I figured I might cut it
	          fer ye.
	
	                    OLD MAN 
	          I told you, I ain't got no boy, now
	          get on out from here and let me be.
	
	Long silence.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I learned to read some. I've read
	          on the Bible quite a bit. I don't
	          understand all of it, but I believe
	          I understand a good deal of it.
	          Them stories Mama and you told me
	          ain't in there. You ort not to of
	          done that to ye boy. 
	              (pause)
	          I've studied on killin' you. But I
	          don't reckon they's no reason fer
	          it if all you're gonna do is set
	          there in that chair. You'll be dead
	          soon enough I reckon and the
	          world'll be shut of ye. 
	              (Karl walks toward the
	               kitchen and turns back to
	               the old man)
	          You ort not to of killed my
	          brother. He ort to have had a
	          chance to grow up. Sometimes he
	          would of had fun.
	
	EXT. YARD
	
	Karl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in
	the corner and kneels down. He pushes some grass aside to
	reveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across. In front of
	it, the ground is raised a little. He stares at the rock for
	a moment and touches it.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Little feller.
	
	EXT. A LARGE OLD WOODEN SLAT BRIDGE - DUSK
	
	Karl stands on the side of the bridge looking into the river
	below.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	All the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed
	asleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in bed
	staring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring.
	Suddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp
	and sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a
	start. From their P.O.V. we see Karl standing in the door
	holding a hammer.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          What in the goddamn hell are you
	          doin'? It's the middle of the
	          night.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          What do you want, hun?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I want to be baptized.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Baptized? Well, get baptized then.
	          I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin'
	          preacher, goddamnit! I can't
	          baptize you.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          We'll go to church and get you
	          baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go
	          on back to bed.
	
	                    DOYLE
	          What are you doin' with that damn
	          hammer?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't rightly know. I just kindly
	          woke up a-holdin' it.
	
	INT. CHURCH - DAY
	
	We see a shot of Frank and Linda and Vaughan in a church pew.
	The church is pretty full. From their P.O.V. we seek Karl in
	a robe standing in the baptismal tank. The preacher takes
	Karl and dunks him under the water and brings him back up.
	
	INT. WHEATLEY LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	Doyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl come
	through the front door.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          How'd your baptizin' go?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          It went real good.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Well, that's good. It's about time
	          to eat and you know what I'm
	          cravin'? Some of that take out
	          chicken. Why don't you run get some
	          of it, honey, for lunch?
	
	                    LINDA
	              (to Frank and Karl)
	          Would y'all like that?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Yeah, I guess.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken
	          leg.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          All right, y'all gonna go with me?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Naw, hell, let them stay here with
	          me and do men things. There might
	          be some kind of ball game on we can
	          watch. You go on.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          I'll be back in a little bit then.
	
	She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I really just wanted to git your
	          mama out of the house for a minute
	          so we can have a talk. Y'all set
	          down.
	
	They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Now here's the deal. Now that I'm
	          gonna throw my entire life away
	          doin' what I want to come live here
	          with y'all, we have to get a few
	          things straight. See, Frank, me and
	          you mama wouldn't have any problems
	          if it wadn't for you. We'd never
	          have a bad word between us. But
	          since you do exist, if I'm gonna be
	          here as the head of the household,
	          we'll have to live by my rules.
	          And my rules are you don't speak
	          unless you're spoken to. Stay out
	          of my way and do what a regular kid
	          does. You're a weird little shit. I
	          don't get you. So wake up. Face
	          what they call reality. We're gonna
	          be a family now. And it's my
	          family. I'll be payin' the bills so
	          you got me. But I ain't your daddy.
	          You just treat me like I am. I'm
	          the boss, okay. And the other thing
	          is your friend Karl has to go. We
	          can't have a normal family with him
	          livin' in the garage and comin' in
	          the bedroom at four in the mornin'
	          with hammers and shit. See?
	
	                    FRANK
	          Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama
	          said --
	
	Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm.
	Doyle shakes him off.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Don't hit that boy no more.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          You shut up you, fuckin' retard.
	          Get your shit and get out of here. 
	              (to Frank)
	          That was a wake-up slap, Frank.
	          Remember. Reality, like I said.
	          Don't forget any bit of what I said
	          to you and we'll be fine.
	
	Frank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in
	his chair and pops a beer. Karl gets up and goes to the
	garage.
	
	INT. GARAGE - DAY
	
	Karl ties his books up with his strap and gets a bag from his
	bed and leaves.
	
	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
	
	Karl is walking away as Linda pulls up in her car and gets
	out with fast-food bags.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't
	          you want some chicken and things?
	
	                    KARL 
	          No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well, okay. I got you some.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Frank, he went off, too. He ain't
	          gonna be in there when you get
	          indoors.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
	
	                    KARL 
	          He wanted to go off and play, I
	          reckon. 
	              (pause)
	          You go in there and you and that
	          Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have
	          to worry yourself none.
	
	                    LINDA
	          All right then. Well, I'll see you
	          later. If you see Frank, tell him
	          to come on back home. I don't get
	          to see him all day except Sundays.
	          He can play tomorrow.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Ma'am?
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Yeah.
	
	                    KARL 
	          You're a good mama to that boy. You
	          care for him. You work hard fer him
	          to take care of him. You light him
	          up in his eyes, I've seen it. He
	          wouldn't know what to do without
	          ye.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          Well thank you, hun. That's real
	          good of you to say. I wouldn't know
	          what to do without him either.
	
	                    KARL 
	          You've been real good to me, too.
	          It ain't ever'body that'd make
	          biscuits in the middle of the
	          night. You and that boy has give me
	          a good feelin'.
	
	                    LINDA 
	          We sure like havin' you.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Thank ye. 
	              (Karl walks away, then
	               turns)
	          I'm just getting around to tellin'
	          you, but I fixed your warshin'
	          machine.
	
	EXT. SECRET PLACE - DAY
	
	Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a
	stick. He hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees
	Karl coming toward him.
	
	                    FRANK
	          Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come
	          out here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I knowed you'd be here. 
	              (Karl sits on the stump)
	          What are you a-doin' digging with
	          that stob?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Just diggin'. 
	              (pause)
	          I ain't ever gonna be happy now.
	          Not with that son of a bitch movin'
	          in for good. I wish me and you and
	          Mama could just run away. But she
	          said he would find us wherever we
	          went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think
	          it would of been better if I wadn't
	          ever born.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm glad of it you was borned. 
	              (pause)
	          I reckon I ain't gonna be there in
	          the garage no more.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You have to Karl. You have to look
	          out for me. You don't let that son
	          of a bitch run you off.
	
	                    KARL 
	          You're just a boy. You ort not to
	          use that sort of language.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin'
	          bad about you, but why don't you
	          stop Doyle when he gets that away?
	          You're older than him. You're
	          strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let
	          him do that to me and Mama.
	
	                    KARL 
	          That feller's a whole sight meaner
	          than me. He'd just whup the tar out
	          of me.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired,
	          you know that. A kid my age
	          shouldn't be tired of things.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I'm tired, too, Frank. 
	              (pause)
	          If I ain't around no more, it don't
	          mean I don't care fer ye. I care
	          for ye a good deal. I care for you
	          more than anybody they is. We made
	          friends right off the bat.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I care for you, too. But you'll be
	          around, don't say that.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Hit don't make no difference where
	          I was to be. We'll always be
	          friends. There ain't no way to stop
	          that. 
	              (pause)
	          I aim for you to have these books.
	
	He hands him the books.
	
	                    KARL
	          Maybe you can make more sense out
	          of them than I can.
	          I made you a little old book marker
	          and stuck it in that book on
	          Christmas.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You don't want to give away all
	          your books.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I aim fer you to have 'em.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Man. Thanks. 
	              (pause)
	          You know when you get a feelin' and
	          you don't know why?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Yes sir.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          I've got a feelin' today.
	
	                    KARL 
	          Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Like something different. I don't
	          know. 
	              (pause)
	          You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Will ye do somethin' for me if I
	          ast you to?
	
	                    FRANK 
	          You know I would. Whatever you
	          want.
	
	                    KARL
	          Don't go home tonight and stay with
	          that Doyle. He's got it in for ye
	          tonight. I got me a feelin', too.
	          Feels like to me you ort not be
	          there in that house with him
	          liquored up and mean. Ye mama
	          neither. When you get up from here,
	          I want you to go to that feller's
	          house. Your mama's friend. I want
	          you to give me your word on it.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Okay. I give you my word. Is
	          ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you
	          all right?
	
	                    KARL
	          Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly
	          want to put my arm around ye for a
	          minute and then I'm gonna go on and
	          leave here.
	
	                    FRANK 
	          Okay.
	
	Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand
	on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then
	Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes
	the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a
	folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be
	happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in
	the trees.
	
	                    FRANK (CONT'D)
	          Karl!
	
	Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other
	through the trees.
	
	EXT. VAUGHAN'S HOUSE - DAY
	
	Karl knocks on the door. After a moment, Vaughan answers in a
	pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Karl, what are you doing here? Come
	          in.
	
	                    KARL
	          I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast
	          you fer a favor.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Okay.
	
	                    KARL
	          This evenin' I want you to go get
	          Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and
	          have them stay with you tonight.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          What's wrong? Is everything okay?
	
	                    KARL 
	          That dern Doyle is in a bad way
	          again with that drinkin' and bein'
	          mean to folks. Will you give me
	          your word you'll do it?
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt
	          them, has he?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Naw, not yet. 
	              (hands the bag to Vaughan)
	          I want ye to give this to Mizz
	          Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe
	          there's a little somethin' to hep
	          out. Hits what I've earned fixin'
	          lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill
	          Cox.
	
	Vaughan takes the bag.
	
	                    VAUGHAN
	          What about you, Karl? Do you want
	          to stay here?
	
	                    KARL 
	          I don't reckon you have to go with
	          women to be a daddy to a boy. 
	              (pause)
	          You've been real square dealin'
	          with me. The Bible says two men ort
	          not lay together. But I'll bet you
	          the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody
	          like you to Hades. Some folks calls
	          it Hell, I call it Hades. 
	              (Karl starts away)
	          That boy lives inside of his own
	          heart. Hits an awful big place. You
	          take care of that boy.
	
	Vaughan watches Karl walk away.
	
	EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT
	
	Karl stares at the bus station door.
	
	EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Karl stares at the house from the sidewalk.
	
	EXT. OLD WOODS BRIDGE - NIGHT
	
	Karl stares into the river.
	
	INT. COX'S SHOP - NIGHT
	
	Karl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel.
	
	EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Karl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the
	living room.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching TV. He looks
	up as Karl comes around and sits on the sofa.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Where's ever'body else? You seen
	          'em? 
	              (no response)
	          I thought I told you to get the
	          hell moved out of here anyway.
	
	                    KARL 
	          How does a feller go about gettin'
	          ahold of the police?
	
	                    DOYLE (CONT'D)
	          Pick up the fuckin' phone and call
	          'em, I guess.
	
	                    KARL 
	          What numbers do you punch?
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          I told you to get away from here,
	          didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and
	          look at TV. 
	              (notices blade)
	          What are you doin' with that piece
	          of iron? I swear to God you're the
	          weirdest son of a bitch I ever
	          heard of.
	
	                    KARL 
	          I aim to kill you with it.
	
	Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.
	
	                    DOYLE 
	          Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police
	          you push 911. You'll need to tell
	          'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a
	          hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're
	          gonna kill me. 
	              (laughs)
	
	Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We
	see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear
	one short dull thud.
	
	                    DOYLE (O.S.) 
	          Oh God! Oh God!
	
	We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting
	the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to
	the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it
	for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood
	on his face, hand and shirt.
	
	                    KARL 
	              (into phone)
	          Yes ma'am. I need the police over
	          here at the Wheatley house. 
	              (pause)
	          I've killed somebody with a mower

	          Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I
	          hit him two good whacks. That
	          second time just plumb near cut his
	          head in two. 
	              (pause)
	          Hits a little old yeller house
	          right on the corner of Marigold
	          Street and some other street.
	          They's a red pickup truck out front
	          says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION
	          on it. I'll be a settin' here
	          waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the
	          police, Doyle said you might want
	          to send a ambulance or a hearse.
	          Thank ye.
	
	He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar
	of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the
	kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering
	up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the
	mustard jar and runs the knife around it.
	There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the
	biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.
	
	                                        CUT TO:
	
	CLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE
	
	He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull
	back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital
	again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl
	is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          ... on the third day I washed her.
	          She wasn't very clean. I got all
	          the right spots. She was the first
	          one I ever kept for any length of
	          time, you see I get bored easily, I
	          have a short attention span. I
	          can't say she enjoyed her stay,
	          although the washcloth in her mouth
	          held in place by good duct tape
	          kept any complaints to a minimum. I
	          don't really like people who talk a
	          lot. I like to do the talking. I
	          guess that's why I'm so fond of
	          you. You're so easygoing, although
	          I do sense a little tension in you
	          sometimes. By the way, how was it
	          out there? Did you have any fun?
	          Make any new acquaintances? Tell me
	          what it was like.
	
	                    KARL 
	          They was a boy. We made friends.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          I bet you did. I was never bent
	          that way. I'm bent the other way.
	          So, you liked it out there in the
	          world.
	
	                    KARL 
	          It's too big.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          Well, it's not too big in here, is
	          it? 
	              (pause)
	          I feel very generous today. I feel
	          like listening. I'm sure you have
	          plenty to tell me. And please bore
	          me with the details. 
	              (long pause) )
	          Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was
	          it the boy?
	
	                    KARL 
	          Don't say nothin' about that boy.
	
	Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.
	
	                    KARL
	          Fact the bidness, don't you say
	          another word to me. I ain't
	          listenin' to you no more.
	
	Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the
	grass that separates him from the next building. He stares
	out the window, as we:
	
	                                        FADE OUT.
	
	                          THE END

1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1

    An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold
    taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes.
    Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of
    thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on
    the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other
    side.

                               JAVED O/S
              Salim! Salim!


2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2

    Darkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light,
    shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice
    announces.

                            TALKBACK V/O
              Ten to white-out, nine, eight,
              seven...

                               PREM
              Are you ready?

    Silence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly.

                            PREM (CONT'D)
              I said are you ready?

                               JAMAL
              Yes.


3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3

    The thumping at the door continues. The sound of
    mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand
    cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the
    chamber, snaps the chamber shut.

                            TALKBACK V/O
              ...three, two, one, zero. Cue
              Prem, cue applause...

    Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.
    A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...


4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4

    ...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing
    into rapturous applause.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                2.

                                  TALKBACK V/O
                 Go, Prem.

    A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage.
    Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On
    stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man
    stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for
    the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem
    Kumar.

                               PREM
                 Welcome to Who Wants To Be A
                 Millionaire!

    More applause.

                               PREM (CONT'D)
                 Please give a warm welcome to
                 our first contestant of the
                 night- a local from our very own
                 Mumbai!

    Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal
    towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.

                                  PREM (CONT'D)
                 Smile, dammit.

    The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a
    tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him
    ferociously across the face. Then again and again.
    Blood trickles from his mouth.


5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5

    The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the
    harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung
    from the ceiling by his arms.

                               CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                 Your name, bhen chod.

    Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by
    the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the
    lights.

                                  CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D)
                 Your name!

                                  JAMAL
                 Jamal Malik.

    And seamlessly we are back....

                                                           3.


6   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         6

    ...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem
    leans back in his chair, a man at home in his
    surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen.

                            PREM
              So, Jamal, tell us a bit about
              yourself.

    Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved
    under water.


7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7

    We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the
    screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes
    desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged
    up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes.

                            JAMAL V/O
              I work in a call centre. In
              Juhu.


8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8

                            PREM
              A Phone-basher! And what type of
              call centre would this be?

                            JAMAL
              XL 5. Mobile phones.

                            PREM
              Aha! So, you're the man who
              rings me up every single day of
              my life with Special Offers,
              huh?

                            JAMAL
              No, actually, I'm an assistant.

                            PREM
              An Assistant Phone-basher?

    A raised eye-brow at the audience. Amusement ruffles
    through them.

                            PREM (CONT'D)
              And what does an Assistant Phone-
              basher do, exactly?

                            JAMAL
              I- I get tea for people and-



                                                  (CONTINUED)

8    CONTINUED:                                                8

                                PREM
                  - a chi-wallah! Why didn't you
                  say?

     Laughter in the audience.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  So, ladies and gentlemen, Jamal
                  Malik from Mumbai, let's play
                  Who Wants To Be A
                  Millionaire...!

10   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.                          10

     Jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. His
     head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling
     fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable
     Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot
     work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks
     in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen
     pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised.

                                INSPECTOR
                  Has he confessed, yet?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Apart from his name, I can't get
                  a word out of the runt.

                                INSPECTOR
                  You've been here all bloody
                  night, Srinivas. What have you
                  been doing?

     Srinivas shrugs.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Tough guy.

                                INSPECTOR
                  A little electricity will loosen
                  his tongue.

     Constable Srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires
     out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips
     on Jamal's fingers. The Inspector stares, deep in
     thought. Sweat trickles down his face. He wipes it away
     with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Every night I get home, "why
                  can't we have a/c like Bajan
                  Chacha?
                                (MORE)

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Why don't you care about your
                  poor family, dying in this
                  heat." Twenty-four years a
                  policeman and I can't afford
                  bloody a/c.

     Turns on Jamal.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  But you. You've got ten million
                  rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar?
                  And who knows how much further?
                  Fancy the twenty million, do
                  you?

     Jamal just stares.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  I think you probably do.

     The Inspector nods absently to Constable Srinivas who
     turns a handle. Jamal's body pulsates and jerks. He
     screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes
     over to Jamal.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  So. Were you wired up? A mobile
                  or a pager, correct? Some little
                  hidden gadget? No? A coughing
                  accomplice in the audience?
                  Microchip under the skin, huh?

     Constable Srinivas hadn't thought of that. Grabs
     Jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until
     the Inspector has had enough.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Srinivas! Look, it's hot, my
                  wife is giving me hell, I've got
                  a desk full of murderers,
                  rapists, extortionists, assorted
                  bum-bandits...and you. Why don't
                  you save us both a lot of time?
                  Hmm?

     Jamal doesn't answer. The Inspector sighs and sits
     down. Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas
     again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When
     the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector
     goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers
     in front of Jamal's face to check for a response.

                                INSPECTOR OF POLICE
                  He's unconscious, chutiya. What
                  good is that? How many times
                  have I told you-?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Sorry, Sir.

     An excited Young Police Constable sticks his head
     around the door.

                             YOUNG CONSTABLE
               He's coming! Sir.

                             INSPECTOR
               Aré wa, Srinivas, we'll have
               Amnesty International in here
               next, peeing their pants about
               human rights. Get him down, tidy
               him up, for God's sake.

     Constable Srinivas goes over to Jamal and starts to
     undo the crocodile clips.

                             CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
               Maybe he did know the answers.

                              INSPECTOR
               Have you gone soft, Srinivas?
               Professors, lawyers, doctors,
               General Knowledge Wallahs never
               get beyond sixteen thousand
               rupees. And he's on ten million?
               What the hell can a slum dog
               possibly know?

     Jamal lifts his head.

                              JAMAL
               The answers.

     He lifts his head, spits blood out of his mouth and
     says again, straight into the Inspector's face.

                             JAMAL (CONT'D)
               I know the answers.

     Titles. Slum Dog Millionaire.


11   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                  11

     Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present
     Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on
     a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in
     little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their
     feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his
     almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising
     speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air.
     The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.

                             SALIM
               Jamal! Catch it! Catch it!

     The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks
     around trying to get into position.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            7.
11   CONTINUED:                                                  11

     He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are
     scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball
     seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other
     children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that
     they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal
     adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of
     nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as
     it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is
     knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The
     ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his
     feet.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  How could you drop that? It was
                  a sitter.

     Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.


12   EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER. DAY.                                12

     At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of
     wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running
     for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly
     nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming
     abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a
     rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes
     that run in between the shacks of the slum.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Private-ka land! Private-ka
                  land! The planes won't kill you,
                  mader chod, I will!

     Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off,
     head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them.


13   INT. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                        13

     The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are
     three feet wide, with an open drain running down the
     middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the
     shacks have been built right over the paths, turning
     them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with
     slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be
     lost and frightened in minutes.

     But these children are natives and with the practice of
     many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of
     lanes.

     They dodge past people cooking in the doorways,
     sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a
     naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim
     shouts a warning.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.
13   CONTINUED:                                                13

                                SALIM
                  Vinod! Musketeers coming
                  through!

     Without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the
     stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it
     all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.

     The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof
     with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They
     break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the
     slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people,
     stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here,
     drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food,
     playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting
     and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new
     Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands
     Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his
     two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their
     hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so
     carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.

     Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides
     carefully past the car with deprecating bows and
     smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has
     gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv
     rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets
     tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give
     him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the
     tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out
     into sunlight again.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                  Jamal!

     Jamal skids to a halt, bumping into Salim who is
     already frozen.

                                JAMAL
                  Shit. Mummy-ji.

                                JAMAL'S MOTHER
                  Don't you move a muscle.

     The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt
     at the sight of Jamal's mother.

                                JAMAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Thank you, Mister Gupta. I will
                  deal with these two.

     The Guard puts his hands together in grudging respect
     as Jamal's Mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor
     by their t-shirt and marches them down the road.

                                                            9.


14   INT. SCHOOL. DAY.                                           14

     The two renegades are dumped by Jamal's Mother into
     their desks as Mister Nandha hands out ancient school
     books.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               So, the musketeers return. We
               are honoured. Salim. Or Porthos,
               isn't it?

     He crashes the heavy book down on his head. Salim opens
     the book. Jamal glances over and turns the book the
     right way round for Salim.

                             SALIM
               I know!

     Mister Nandha hovers over Jamal's head. He winces in
     anticipation.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               And Athos.

     The book comes down like thunder. Jamal blinks from the
     impact and suddenly we are back....


15   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               15

     ... in the Inspector's office. Jamal watches Srinivas
     fiddling with the video recorder, trying to get a
     picture. Through the pebbled glass, Jamal sees shapes
     moving along the corridor.


16   INT. CORRIDOR. POLICE STATION. DAY.                         16

     The Commissioner of Police is fawning along beside Prem
     as they walk. The Young Constable hurries behind.

                             COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
               It is so kind of you to visit
               our station, Sir. A great
               honour.

                             PREM
               Not at all, not at all. I hope
               you will visit us, Commissioner.

     Out of his jacket pocket comes a couple of tickets.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Bring the family. It's a lot of
               fun.

                             COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
               Oh! A thousand thanks, Sir.
               Missus Janda will be overcome.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             10.
16   CONTINUED:                                                    16

     He turns to the Young Constable.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                                (CONT'D)
                  chi, you lazy chutiyé, chi!

     The Inspector joins them in the corridor.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                                (CONT'D)
                  Ah, Inspector! Cracked it?

     The Inspector moves his head. Maybe yes, maybe no.

                                  INSPECTOR
                  Nearly, Sir.

     The Commissioner is just able to contain his apoplexy.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                  Nearly? Nearly? When Prem Kumar
                  himself has-

     Prem holds up a tolerant hand to the Commissioner who
     falls silent. Turns his laser-like charm onto the
     Inspector.

                                PREM
                  Inspector. How good to meet you.
                  Clearly the kid cheated.

                                  INSPECTOR
                  Clearly, Sir.

                                PREM
                  So, it is just a question of
                  how, no?

                                INSPECTOR
                  Indeed, Sir. The proof. That is
                  all we need.

                                PREM
                  We are lucky to have a man of
                  your obvious experience on the
                  case. This kid might run rings
                  around us filmi types, but he
                  won't make fools out of the
                  Mumbai Police Force, I can see
                  that.

     Forced laughter from the Commissioner.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  In front of sixty million
                  people.

     More laughter. And fear.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.
16   CONTINUED: (2)                                              16

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Which is what will happen if we
               don't get a result, Gentlemen.
               He goes back on the show to rob
               us all with the whole of India
               watching. But. I can rely on
               you.

     Prem walks away down the corridor. Stops and turns,
     apparently casual.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Has he- has he made any
               allegations?

                                INSPECTOR
               Allegations?

                             PREM
               He's a cunning one. A convincing
               liar. Don't be taken in,
               Inspector, don't be taken in.

     Walks off. The Inspector stares after him. Goes back
     into his office.


17   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE.                                    17

     Srinivas has finally got the recorder to work. We get
     snatches of filmi dancing- heroines singing on
     mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of
     flags- cricket and finally after some shouting by the
     Inspector, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?.

                             INSPECTOR
               So, Mister Malik, the man who
               knows the answers. Talk.

     We close in on the tv screen where Prem is smiling his
     crocodile smile and find ourselves....


18   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         18

     ...as Prem asks the first question.

                             PREM
               So, are you ready for your first
               question for one thousand
               rupees?

                                JAMAL
               Yes.

                             PREM
               Not bad money to sit in a chair
               and answer a question. Better
               than making the tea, no?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           12.
18   CONTINUED:                                                  18

                                  JAMAL
                  No. Yes. No.

                                PREM
                  No. Yes. No. Apka final answer?

     Laughter from the audience. Jamal looks confused. Prem
     waves it away, switches on his serious face.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Remember, you have three
                  lifelines if you're not sure of
                  your answer- Ask the Audience,
                  50/50 and Phone a Friend. So,
                  the question:

     The lights go down, the portentous music rolls.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Who was the star of the 1973 hit
                  film Zanjeer. Was it A-

     Close on Jamal's eyes.


19   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          19

     A tiny shack. A garland of dirty plastic flowers
     surrounds a torn flyer for one of Amitabh Bacchan's
     films.


20   EXT. JUHU SLUM. RUBBISH DUMP. NIGHT.                        20

     Salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety
     wooden pier, though it is not water, but a sea of
     rubbish and sewage that lies below them. There are
     dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto
     airport land, each with a toilet shack perched right at
     the end. Another man hurries up the pier and hands
     Salim a coin.

                                SALIM
                  Immediately, sir.

     Turns to the toilet door.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Bhai, get out of there. Prakash
                  wants a shit.

                                  JAMAL O.S.
                  Not finished.

                                PRAKASH
                  Stop your time-pass. This is
                  urgent.

                                JAMAL O.S.
                  It's a shy one. Since when was
                  there a time limit on a crap?

                                SALIM
                  Since there was a customer
                  waiting, that's when.

     He flashes another placatory smile at Prakash.

                                JAMAL O.S.
                       (singing/ grunting)
                  Come on out, you beauty, unveil
                  yourself, my darling-warling....

                                PRAKASH
                  Look, kid, I got a bad stomach.
                  It's borderline....

     A disturbing combination of heaving and snake-charmer
     noises come from the toilet shack. Finally Prakash can
     stand it no longer.

                                PRAKASH (CONT'D)
                  I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me
                  that.

     He snatches the coin back from Salim and hurries off.
     Salim bangs on the toilet door.

                                SALIM
                  You just lost me good money, you
                  stupid idiot-

     Salim stops. In the distance, there is the faint sound
     of shouting, a crowd coming closer. Then the crowd
     bursts through the outer shacks of the slum, pour onto
     the rubbish dump and make for the airfield.

                                MAN
                  It's Amitabh! That's his
                  helicopter!

                                JAMAL O.S.
                  Amitabh? Amitabh Bacchan?


21   INT/EXT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                    21

     Jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the
     shack. He sees crowds surging around the pier, charging
     towards a landing helicopter. Salim shoves the chair
     under the door handle- effectively locking it- and runs
     down the pier to join the chase. Jamal pulls up his
     shorts.

                                JAMAL
                  No! Wait! Salim, sala! Salim!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                           14.

     Rattles the locked door. Pulls a torn flyer from his
     pocket advertising an Amitabh movie.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Wait! Amitabh....

     He looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath
     him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. A
     final rattle of the door. There is only one way out. He
     jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's
     worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out
     the mire. He runs for the helicopter.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji!

     Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a
     way through, but the adults shove him back. Not so for
     Jamal. The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits
     of sewage from his clothes. Disgusted fans curse him
     and get out of his way. Suddenly, the red sea parts and
     there is nobody between Jamal and Amitabh Bacchan
     getting out of the helicopter.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Please. Amitabh-ji.

     Jamal holds out his flyer. Used to signing autographs,
     the movie star barely looks at Jamal. He takes the
     flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji.

     He hands the flyer back to Jamal as his bodyguards
     surround him and hustle him into a car. Jamal chases
     the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. Kisses it.


22   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                      22

     From high up, the rickety tin roof-tops of the slum
     seem to stretch to the horizon. There is a distant
     shout, a figure waving an arm.

                                 MAN
                  It's coming!

     Then another shout and another, a chain of voices
     coming closer. People come out of their doorways with
     pails and buckets. The shouts come closer until we see
     a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and
     singing in the lane. Jamal is the happiest boy in the
     slum.

                                JAMAL
                       (singing)
                  Amitabh, Amitabh, oh Amitabh!

                  I have your autograph, oh, holy
                  Amitabh!

                                   MOTHER
                  Here it comes!

     Water comes bubbling through a hose and Jamal's mother
     hoses down her ecstatic son.


23   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    23

     Not far away, Salim wanders to Mister Chi's stall. He
     glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the
     hindi film on Mister Chi's tv and surreptitiously slips
     Mister Chi the signed flyer. Mister Chi takes a look
     and gives Salim a small wad of rupees. He sticks the
     money in his pocket, slinks away.


24   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    24

     A tear-stained Jamal is furiously trying to batter
     Salim, but Salim's extra strength and height means that
     he can keep Jamal at bay with one hand, Jamal's
     flailing fists punching thin air.

                                   JAMAL
                  Sala! Sala!

     Salim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder.


25   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           25

     Close on the tv screen in the Inspector's office. Prem
     ponders Jamal's choice. Presses a button on his
     computer.

                                PREM V/O
                  You chose A- Amitabh Bacchan.
                  Guess what? You just won one
                  thousand rupees!

     Applause on screen. The Inspector looks at Jamal. Jamal
     shrugs.

                                JAMAL
                  You don't have to be a genius.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  I knew it was Amitabh.

                                   JAMAL
                  Like I said.

     Constable Srinivas twists Jamal's arm behind his back,
     evincing a squeal of pain from Jamal.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  He's the most famous man in
                  India...!

     The Inspector stares at Jamal, turns back to the tv
     where Prem is asking the next question.

                                PREM O/S
                  For four thousand rupees....the
                  national emblem of India is a
                  picture of three lions. What is
                  written underneath? Is it...

                  B) Lies alone triumph. C)
                  Fashion alone triumphs. D) Money
                  alone triumphs.

     Prem shoots a mock puzzled look out to the audience
     eliciting giggles from them.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  What do we think, Jamal? The
                  most famous phrase in our
                  country's history. Maybe you
                  want to phone a friend?

     Laughter from the audience. The studio lights bear down
     on Jamal. a drop of sweat trickles down his forehead.
     Prem is loving his discomfort.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Or Ask the Audience? I have a
                  hunch they might just know the
                  answer. What do we think?

     He gestures expansively at his audience. Oh, they love
     him.

                                 JAMAL
                  Yes.

     Prem whistles. Raises his eyes at the audience.

27   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             27

     The Inspector presses pause. Sighs.

                                INSPECTOR
                  So, Jamal. My five-year-old
                  daughter knows the answer to
                  that, but you don't. Strange for
                  a millionaire genius. What
                  happened? Your accomplice nip
                  out for a piss, did he? Or did
                  he just not cough loud enough?

     Silence. Constable Srinivas kicks Jamal's chair.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  The Inspector asked you a
                  question.

                                JAMAL
                  How much is bhelpuri at Jeevan's
                  stall on Chowpatty Beach?

                                INSPECTOR
                  What?

                                JAMAL
                  One bhelpuri. How much?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                       (can't help
                        himself)
                  Ten rupees.

                                JAMAL
                  Wrong. Fifteen since Divali. Who
                  stole Constable Varma's bicycle
                  outside Dadar Station last
                  Thursday?

                                INSPECTOR
                       (amused)
                  You know who that was?

                  Everyone in Juhu knows that.
                  Even five year-olds.

     Despite himself, the Inspector laughs. Then leans in.

     Suddenly fixes him with his eyes.

31   EXT. DHOBI. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                 31

     Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty
     water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are
     washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from
     them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old
     Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other
     children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes
     sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.

                  It's going to come. Today. I can
                  feel it.

     The woman next to her nods.

                                WOMAN
                  Hope so. My head is exploding.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          20.

                                MOTHER
                  Yes. We need rain.

     Jamal is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and
     Krishna are throwing to each other. He's not having
     much success. The ball flies overhead again from Salim
     to Krishna. Jamal dives for it, misses and goes
     underwater. When he comes up for air, he shakes his
     head, clearing his ears of water. Then he stops,
     listens. Shakes his head again. Definitely something
     strange. Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading
     catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's
     mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of
     shouting, roaring. The wave of noise is still faint but
     getting louder. A frozen moment broken by:

                                MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Run! Jamal, Salim, run!

     Everybody stares at her. A train speeds through as she
     continues to shout, her words lost beneath the
     thundering train.

                                MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Go! Run!

     The train goes through, the last carriage flying past
     suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men
     wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. They come
     screaming across the railway tracks.

                                SALIM
                  Krishna, quick!

     Salim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with
     difficulty through the water.

                                KRISHNA
                  No way! You're a bloody Muslim.
                  Get away from me!

     The rioters leap the tracks and are upon them.

                                KRISHNA (CONT'D)
                  They're Muslims! Him and him!

                                MOTHER
                  Go!

     Salim and Jamal scramble out and retreat into the
     lanes. Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a
     rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men
     who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags
     Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they
     get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three-
     year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish
     blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a
     bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in
     a pair of pants runs after them.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         21.
31   CONTINUED: (2)                                            31

     She has two bleeding red gashes on her back. They turn
     a corner and head towards some vans full of police.
     Jamal sees Mister Nandha, the school teacher, stops.

                                JAMAL
               Salim!

     Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis
     of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
               Mister Nandha.

     Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid
               dhvasth hai.

                                JAMAL
               Mister Nandha?

                             MISTER NANDHA
               We have destroyed your mosque.
               Now, the followers of Ram will
               drive you dogs out of our city.

     From behind his back he produces a knife and runs
     towards Jamal, screaming.

                             MISTER NANDHA (CONT'D)
               Ram has returned to his temple!
               Ram has returned!

     They flee, but Jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. He
     chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. The spell
     broken, and they are off.


32   INT. STREET. EVENING.                                     32

     They reach the safety of the police vans. But inside
     the vans, the police are smoking, laughing, playing
     cards. Down the street, a man comes whirling out of a
     doorway, his hair on fire. He falls into the middle of
     the street and is engulfed by rioters. Unperturbed, the
     police continue to chat. Salim and Jamal look on,
     horrified. Then one of the police men turns, looks at
     them. Is interested. Motions to a colleague. Puts out
     his cigarette with purpose.

                             JAMAL
               Let's go, bhai.

     Salim and Jamal run. The girl follows.

                                                        22.


33   EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                     33

     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.
     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly
     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.

                              JAMAL
                We should go back.

     Silence.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                See if Ama-

     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a
     moment. But only a moment.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                What about Jeevan Chacha?

     Salim shakes his head.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                Maybe he-

     Salim shakes his head again.

                              SALIM
                - I saw him. He was with them.

                              JAMAL
                But he wouldn't hurt-

                              SALIM
                - he was with them!

                              JAMAL
                But-

                              SALIM
                - shut up, Jamal, can't you?
                Just shut up!

     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and
     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps
     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds
     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                Ja!

     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across
     the city. Rain begins to come down.

                              JAMAL
                What shall we do?



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           23.
33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a
     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their
     faces.


34   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                 34

     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes
     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,
     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,
     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap
     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the
     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.

                                SALIM
                  Go away. Ja, ja!

     The girl might not even have heard.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  She'll have the Security Guard
                  onto us, standing there.

                                JAMAL
                  Not if we let her in.

                                SALIM
                  No.

                                JAMAL
                  She could be the third
                  musketeer.

                                SALIM
                  I am the head of this family,
                  now. And I say no. Piss off,
                  you.

     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal
     follows suit.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  We don't even know what the
                  third musketeer's called.


35   EXT. JUHU SLUM. DAY                                         35

     A flash of Jamal's mother being clubbed to the ground.
     Her scream.


36   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. LATER.                                 36

     Jamal wakes with a jolt and a scream half-swallowed in
     his mouth. He shuts his eyes tight, trying to force the
     image out. His breathing slows and he sees the girl
     staring at him. Salim, too, is staring into nothing.
     The rain is still falling.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           24.
36   CONTINUED:                                                  36

     The girl goes back to drawing shapes in the mud with
     her finger. Jamal climbs out of the pipe. Looks at
     Salim for permission or refusal, but he just continues
     to stare. So, Jamal walks across to her. She looks up,
     wary.

                                JAMAL
                  Where's your Mother?

     Silence.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Father?

     The girl shakes her head slightly. Jamal takes the
     plastic sheet from around his shoulders. Gives it to
     her.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  I'm Jamal. He's Salim.

                                  LATIKA
                  Latika.

     Jamal goes back to his water pipe, climbs in. Watches
     her huddled under the sheet. Sighs, motions for her to
     join him. She darts across, jumps into the water pipe
     and huddles up next to Jamal.


37   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               37

     Jamal looks at the Inspector.

                                JAMAL
                  I wake up every morning wishing
                  I didn't know the answer to that
                  question? If it wasn't for Ram
                  and Allah, I would still have a
                  Mother.


38   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT                                          38

                  Final answer?

                                  JAMAL
                  Final answer.

     Prem stares at him for dramatic effect. Presses his
     computer.

                                PREM
                  Computer-ji, D lock kiya-jaye.

     The lights dim, the music swells.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Jamal Malik, you answered D? Ram
                  is depicted with a bow and arrow
                  in his hand. And guess what?
                  You've just won sixteen thousand
                  rupees! Well done, my friend.
                  Time for a commercial break-
                  don't go away, now.

     Music, applause. Prem switches off his professional
     smile. Gets up.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Got lucky, huh? I'd take the
                  money. You'll never get the next
                  one.

                                JAMAL
                  You're from the Juhu slum,
                  aren't you?

                                PREM
                  Hmm? Sure. Know where I live
                  now, kid? Pali Hill. Twelve
                  bedrooms, a/c in every room, two
                  kitchens, a gym and a screening
                  room. Steel balls is what it
                  takes, my friend, steel balls.

     The Floor Manager comes over and gives his head-phones
     set to Prem. Prem listens.

                                DIRECTOR V/O
                  Prem? Tone it down, for goodness
                  sake. You're making him a
                  laughing stock.

     Prem glances up at the gallery with contempt.

                                PREM
                  We're having fun here. They love
                  it...Where the hell do you get
                  them from?

     He makes no attempt to hide the conversation from
     Jamal.

                                DIRECTOR V/O
                  It's supposed to be a quiz show,
                  not a blood sport.

     He chucks the head-phones back at the Floor Manager.
     Glances in the wings. Sees Nita, the make-up woman.
     Gets up and goes over.


39   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             39

     In the half-light, backstage, Nita dabs his face with
     powder.

                             PREM
               Meet me after the show. Please.

                             NITA
               No.

                             PREM
               Nita, I can explain.

                             NITA
               No need. I read it in bloody
               Stardust. Didn't even have the
               balls to tell me. "Prem's
               happiness with another baby on
               the way". After everything you
               said...

                             PREM
               Baby, it all happened before I
               met you. I swear to you.

                             NITA
               She's got the gestation period
               of an elephant, then.

     Prem is about to object. But instead, he laughs.

                             PREM
               You see? Amidst all this misery,
               only you can make me laugh.

     Scornful but hints of melting.

                             NITA

     Nita turns away. The Floor Manager comes over.

     Prem slings himself in a chair.

                                PREM
                  No. I'm not going on.

                  I can't. Without you, it's all
                  pointless.

     Clicks his fingers at the Floor Manager.

                               PREM (CONT'D)
                  You. Tell the Director.

     Nita shakes her head at the Floor Manager who by now is
     looking very worried.

     Prem shrugs and folds his arms. Sees her weaken.

     He grins, jumps up, blows her a kiss, and stalks back
     on stage.

                                JAMAL
                  I don't have a girl-friend.

     Cheering and music. Prem switches on his charm.

                  Welcome back to Who Wants to be

                  Assistant- from Mumbai, is on
                  sixteen thousand rupees and has

                  you ready for the next question?

                                  JAMAL
                  Yes.

                                PREM
                  Then, let's play.

     Portentous music. The lights dim.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  For sixty-four thousand rupees.
                  The British architect Frederick
                  Stevens designed which famous
                  building in India? Is it: A) The
                  Taj Mahal. B) Chhatrapati
                  Shivaji Terminus. C) India Gate.
                  D) Howrah Bridge. What do you
                  think, Jamal? Are you one of
                  those tea-boys with a penchant
                  for architecture?


41   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   41

     Known to everyone as VT station, this monument to
     Victorian railway architecture is a dangerous place to
     be at rush hour.

     Even before the train has stopped, men are jumping from
     the open doors, or vaulting out of the windows or from
     the roof of the train to join the tens of thousands of
     Mumbaites streaming to and from work. A seventeen-year
     old Jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves
     through the crowds. He checks the time. The digital
     numerals flick to five O'clock. Looks around the tide
     of humanity.


42   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         42

                                PREM
                  So, what's it to be? Walk away
                  and this cheque for sixteen
                  thousand rupees is yours. Look,
                  it's even got your name on it.

     He produces a cheque and waves it at Jamal.

                                JAMAL
                  I don't have a bank account.

     Laughter from the audience. Prem is momentarily wrong-
     footed.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  But I'll take cash.

     More laughter, this time with Jamal, rather than at
     him. Prem gets up and starts rummaging theatrically
     through his jacket pockets and trousers.

                                PREM
                  Nope. Looks like the Producer's
                  stolen my wallet again-

                                 JAMAL
                  - I'll play.

     Nobody was expecting this. Least of all Prem who has to
     rearrange his features into one of surprised delight.
     He sits down.

                                 PREM
                  You'll play?

                                 JAMAL
                  Why not?

                                PREM
                  Well, well, well. We've got a
                  wild one, here.

     Prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness.

43   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   43

     The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
     descending river of people out of his way, the eighteen
     year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross
     the platforms. He pushes to the middle of the
     footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He scans
     the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her: the
     eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful,
     over the other side of the station. A world away. She
     is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

                                JAMAL
                  Latika! Latika!

     But though he is screaming her name, his voice is
     swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
     thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Latika!

     Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one
     figure against an army of white-robed people.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Latika!

                  Sure?

                                JAMAL V/O
                  I think so.

                                PREM V/O
                  You think so. A brave man,
                  Ladies and Gentlemen, a brave
                  man.


44   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   44

     The commuters have mostly gone. Jamal is pacing the
     platform desperately. He stops, stares blankly at the
     statue in front of him- a proud, rather pompous figure
     in a Victorian frock coat. The plaque reads: Frederick
     Stevens.

                                                        31.


45   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           45

     The Inspector, Srinivas and Jamal are staring at the
     video recorder.

                             JAMAL
               Yes. Final answer. Chhatrapati
               Shivaji Terminus.

                             PREM
               Is the right answer! Sixty-four
               thousand rupees to you, Sir!

     Applause and music. The Inspector presses pause. Stares
     at Jamal.

                             INSPECTOR
               And did she come back?

     Jamal smiles sadly.

                             JAMAL
               I wouldn't be here if she had.

                             INSPECTOR
               Pretty was she?

     Jamal stares down at his feet.

                             INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
               Guess not.

     Right in the eyes.

                             JAMAL
               The most beautiful woman in the
               world.

     Constable Srinivas snorts. Suddenly, Jamal is out of
     his chair and at Srinivas' throat. The combined force
     of the Inspector and Srinivas force him roughly back
     down. He is again handcuffed to the chair.

                             INSPECTOR OF POLICE
               Well, well. The slum dog barks.
               Money or women. The reason for
               most mistakes in life. Looks
               like you got mixed up with both.
               Srinivas, you need the exercise:
               a trip to VT Station to check on
               the statue. And lock your bloody
               bike up.

     Constable Srinivas swears under his breath but bumbles
     out.

                  million rupees...the song Chalo

     The lights dim, the music swells and Prem presses his
     computer.


49   EXT. MUMBAI STREET. NIGHT.                                49

     Jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out
     numbers from it. There is something not quite right
     about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet
     by his ears. Salim is standing on his shoulders and
     spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
     certain lack of confidence.

                  with the stick going down, Salim-
                  six- stick going up-

     Latika's head appears from around the corner.

                                 LATIKA
                        (whispered)
                  Oi!

     But they don't hear. Then she is running for her life
     past the pair of them.


                                JAMAL
                  Six, one, shit, let's go-

     Salim collapses off Jamal's shoulders and all three run
     off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed-on
     adverts all reading: "Beanbags- 989 4909661". A fat
     Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the
     corner. Chases them up an alley. Nowhere to go except
     through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a
     private house.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Got you now, little shits.


50   EXT. GARDEN. NIGHT.                                        50

     They charge across the lawn, down one side of the house
     where all the washing is hanging. The Guard gets caught
     up in drying sheets, towels. He fights his way through
     to see Salim, Latika and Jamal leaping over the wall to
     safety. But Jamal turns, jumps back and grabs a girl's
     dress from the line.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Aha! Little thief!

     The Security Guard lands a couple of blows on Jamal's
     back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn,
     dress in hand. The Security Guard gives up.

                                SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                  Pervert!


51   INT. ALLEY. NIGHT.                                         51

     Jamal is examing the bruises on his legs.

                                SALIM
                  Useless bloody look-out. What
                  good is she, huh?


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                        34.

                                LATIKA
                       (infuriated)
                  I tried to warn you.

                                JAMAL
                  It's okay, Salim.

     Latika slips on the dress. Spins. Both of them look up.
     Stare. She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed
     into a beautiful girl.


52   EXT. GORAI BEACH DUMPING GROUND. DAY.                     52

     Blazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of
     rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for
     ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks,
     Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each
     one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress
     is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig
     another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares.
     Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes
     through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who
     waves, pulls up in the dump. "Hope Orphanage is written
     on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around.


53   INT. `TENT'. DAY.                                         53

     Under sheets of plastic propped up on sticks, Jamal and
     Salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day.
     Jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him- a
     silhouette with a halo of sun behind him. Out of his
     bag, the man produces a bottle of Thumbs Up. He uncaps
     it with an alluring hiss. It is almost an advert for
     thirst-quenching affluence. Almost instinctively, Salim
     and Jamal stir.

                                MAN
                  Hello.

     He hands the bottle to Salim, gets another from his bag
     and waves it questioningly at Jamal.

                                MAN (CONT'D)
                  Hot, huh? My name is Maman.


54   EXT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                  54

     The hills on the edge of Bombay. Greenery and space,
     for the first time in the film. The pick-up truck pulls
     up outside a building with Jamal, Salim and Latika
     sitting on a bench in the back. Maman gets out. Drops
     the gate on the back of the pick-up.

                                MAMAN
                  Anyone hungry? Come on in.

                                                          35.


55   INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                         55

     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a
     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and
     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He
     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with
     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning
     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks
     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or
     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on
     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.

                             JAMAL
               He must be a very good man to
               look after these people.

                             SALIM
                    (glancing at them)
               A saint.

     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim
     overhears.

                             ARVIND
               We're not allowed to talk to
               them.

                                LATIKA
               Why not?

     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman
     who is looking right at them.

                             LATIKA (CONT'D)
               Well, if there are seconds,
               Maman is definitely a Saint.

     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he
     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.
     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out
     laughing.

                             LATIKA (CONT'D)
               I tell you, Lord Siva is with
               us.


56   INT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                   56

     Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are
     standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set
     to music. Maman is leading the singing, walking up and
     down the line listening to each one individually. He
     stops at one small boy, Arvind, and listens. Nods his
     head, pleased, and continues down the line until he
     stops in front of Jamal. Holds up his hand.

                             MAMAN
               Stop! You. Again.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          36.
56   CONTINUED:                                                 56

     Jamal starts singing again. He has the sweetest of
     voices. Untrained but pure. Maman smiles, ruffles
     Jamal's hair, impressed.

                                  MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Everyone.

     They all join in. Maman continues down the line. He
     stops at Salim whose octave-slipping singing is lusty
     and appallingly out of tune. Maman winces and moves on.
     Standing next to Salim, Latika giggles. Immediately,
     Salim is on her. Before a fight breaks out, Punnoose
     pulls Salim off Latika and hurls him across the room.
     Salim gets up and charges at Punnoose. For a second,
     Punnoose is back-footed, but then pins Salim's arms to
     his side. Maman laughs. Approaches Salim.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  You sing like one, and you fight
                  like one. I think you've found
                  your dog, Punnoose.


57   EXT. CENTRAL MUMBAI TRAFFIC. DAY.                          57

     A group of children are sitting in the jumble of
     concrete under a motorway flyover. Cars surround them,
     bumper to bumper. Latika and Jamal are playing an
     improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs. They are
     giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.
     Salim and Punnoose are sitting together, smoking. Salim
     is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose
     grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.

                                SALIM
                  Okay, let's go, let's go! It's
                  not a bloody holiday!

     The children get to their feet. Latika sighs, puts a
     patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches.
     Suddenly, the lame beggar. Salim goes over to one of
     the girls, who is carrying a sleeping baby. Puts out
     his hand.

                                  SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Give me that.

     The girl shakes her head. Salim grabs her by the hair
     in one hand and takes the baby with the other. He
     shoves her to the ground. The other children stare.

                                  JAMAL
                  Hey, Salim!

     He challenges Jamal.

                                SALIM
                  What, choté bhai? You got a
                  problem?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        37.
57   CONTINUED:                                                57

     He laughs and walks over to Latika.

                                   SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Here. For you.

                                LATIKA
                  I don't want it.

                                SALIM
                  You'll earn double. I'm doing
                  you a favour, Latika.

                                JAMAL
                  She doesn't want it.

                                   SALIM
                  Chup, Jamal.

     Latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars.

                                   SALIM (CONT'D)
                  I'll drop it.

     He holds the baby up. Latika grabs the baby with a cry
     just as Salim releases it from his hands. Salim pinches
     the baby.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Triple if it's crying.

     Latika snatches it away. Salim laughs, goes back to
     sitting with Punnoose. The children scatter to the cars
     trapped at the lights, tapping plaintively on the
     windows and making the universal begging gesture.


58   INT. ORPHANAGE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                           58

     Surrounded by beer bottles, Punnoose is slumped asleep
     by the kitchen door. Latika edges past, avoids the cook
     sleeping under the table and goes to a shelf laden with
     vegetables. She pulls down a bunch of chillies still on
     the vine, strips a few off and tip-toes out with them.


59   INT. ORPHANAGE. DORMITORY. NIGHT.                         59

     Sleeping children, three or four to a mattress on the
     floor. Latika tip-toes around the mattresses. She
     pauses over one in particular where we see Salim,
     asleep. She carefully pulls up the sheet, delves
     underneath. Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face
     for a second. Then suddenly, he is bolt upright and
     screaming. He charges around the room clutching his
     genitals in agony.

                                SALIM
                  Madher chod...!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           38.
59   CONTINUED:                                                  59

     He sprints out of the room, wailing.


60   INT. ORPHANAGE. SHOWERS. NIGHT.                             60

     The lights are on and two dozen children are screaming
     with laughter as Salim stands under the make-shift
     shower directing the water down his pants to his
     burning genitals, his face a picture of agony. Latika
     wipes crushed chillies from her hands.

                                SALIM
                  You're dead, sala.

     She smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug. Then
     Punnoose comes stalking in and the children scatter
     away.

                                PUNNOOSE
                  Get back to bed, dogs! What the
                  hell...

                                JAMAL V/O
                  They taught me every song in the
                  history of Indian music.

                                INSPECTOR V/O
                  And why would they do that, I
                  wonder?


61   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          61

     In a shack, Arvind is singing one of Surdas' bhajans in
     front of Maman and an old man who by his ragged
     appearance must be a villager. Punnoose and Salim sit
     behind Arvind.

                                MAMAN
                  Very good, very good. I am
                  pleased, Arvind. He is ready.

                                ARVIND
                  Ready?

     Maman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round,
     Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after
     the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The
     villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the
     lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it.
     Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb.
     Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and
     passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with
     a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with
     the cloth nods to Punnoose.

                                PUNNOOSE
                  Salim!

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           39.
61   CONTINUED:                                                  61

     Utterly bemused, Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay
     Arvind on the table. The villager takes hold of
     Arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. He brings the spoon
     close. Suddenly, Salim is being sick in the corner of
     the shack. By the time he has turned back, the villager
     is wiping the spoon on a blood-soaked rag.

                                MAMAN
                  Okay. Take him out the back.

     Punnoose picks up Arvind and carries him out.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Now the other one. Salim, go get
                  Jamal.

     A frozen moment.

                                SALIM
                  What?

                                MAMAN
                  Gunfighter Number One, isn't
                  that right, Salim? The money,
                  the women, the cars...you want
                  them bad, huh? And why not?

     Maman gets out of his chair. Approaches Salim.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  The time has come to choose,
                  yaar. The life of a slum dog or
                  the life of a man. A real man. A
                  gunfighter, Salim.

     Maman holds Salim's head in his hands.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Your destiny is in your hands,
                  bhai. You can be me. Or nobody.
                  Understand?

                                SALIM
                  Yes, Maman.

     Maman nods.

                                MAMAN
                  So, brother, go get Jamal.

     Salim is frozen for another few seconds, then turns and
     walks out of the door. Punnoose appears at the door.
     Maman nods to him and he slips off after Salim.


62   INT. DORMITORY, ORPHANAGE. NIGHT.                           62

     All the children are asleep apart from Jamal who is
     crouched underneath a couple of wash-basins.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          40.
62   CONTINUED:                                                 62

     He is talking through a plate-sized hole in the
     crumbling masonry. Latika's eyes can be seen.

                                JAMAL
                  ...weddings, government things,
                  big parties. If Maman says my
                  voice is ready. Big money.

                                LATIKA
                  Enough for a room?

                                JAMAL
                  Easily. Maybe an apartment.

                                  LATIKA
                  Really?

                                JAMAL
                  That's what Arvind said. On
                  Harbour Road. You, me and Salim.
                  The three musketeers.

                                LATIKA
                  Harbour Road! We can have ice
                  cream from Babanji's.

                                JAMAL
                  Every day if we want.

     Salim appears at the door. Nods his head at Jamal.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  It's my turn.

                                LATIKA
                  Good luck, Jamal.

     Latika's hand comes through the gap. Jamal takes it for
     a moment. Salim hisses at Jamal. He lets go of the hand
     and heads out.


63   EXT. PATH. NIGHT.                                          63

     Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming
     happily. Salim checks behind him, sees Punnoose
     following.

                                JAMAL
                  So, this is it, hey, bhai? The
                  good life, here we come....

                                SALIM
                       (conversationally)
                  Athos.

     Jamal is suddenly alert. Slows


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        41.
63   CONTINUED:                                                63

                                  JAMAL
                  Porthos?

     Salim nods. Big smile. Puts a hand on Jamal's shoulder.

                                  SALIM
                  When I say.


64   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        64

     Salim guides Jamal into the shack where Maman and the
     Villager are waiting. Maman smiles. Punnoose slips in
     behind Salim.

                                MAMAN
                  Jamal, hello. You have done
                  well. It's time for you to- turn
                  professional.

                                  JAMAL
                  Really?

                                MAMAN
                  Sing me a song, yaar. How about
                  Chalo Ri Murali, huh? My
                  favourite.

     Jamal opens his mouth, then closes it again. Holds out
     his hand.

                                  JAMAL
                  Fifty rupees.

                                  MAMAN
                  What?

                                JAMAL
                       (shrugs)
                  I've turned professional. What
                  can I do?

     Maman laughs.

                                  MAMAN
                  Sala...!

     He throws some notes at him.


65   EXT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        65

     Outside, a giggle. Latika is peering through a gap in
     the wall.

                                                          42.


66    INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66

      Jamal begins to sing. Maman waits a while, then nods to
      Punnoose. Behind Jamal, Punnoose hands Salim the bottle
      of chloroform and the rag. Salim approaches the back of
      Jamal. Salim waits until he has finished the song.
      Raises his hand with the rag in it. Maman smiles, nods.
      Salim flings the contents of the bottle in Punnoose's
      face. Punnoose screams and stumbles back clutching his
      eyes, knocking over the table.

                                SALIM
                Go!

      Salim and Jamal scramble for the door. The knocked-over
      candle catches the spilled chloroform and a curtain
      which whooshes up in flame.

                                LATIKA
                Jamal!

                                JAMAL
                Run!


66A   EXT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66A

      They charge past the prone Arvind- a flash of bloodied
      bandages covering his eyes.


67    EXT. HILLSIDE. NIGHT.                                     67

      Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall
      into holes. The three children are running. Branches
      smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing
      will stop them. Behind them, torches scour the
      undergrowth. Men shouting. They break out of the woods
      and are confronted with a train goods yard.


68    EXT. GOODS YARD. NIGHT.                                   68

      They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the
      shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel
      engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and
      Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of
      the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is
      fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his
      hand. Jamal grabs it and is hauled in. Jamal holds his
      hand out to Latika.

                              JAMAL
                Come on! Faster!

      She reaches out to him. Their hands almost touch.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             43.
68   CONTINUED:                                                    68

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Take it! Take it! I can't
                  reach...

     Salim barges Jamal out of the way. Jamal      stumbles back
     as Salim reaches his hand out to Latika,      so he doesn't
     see Latika's hand grasp Salim's, nor see      their eyes
     lock onto each other, nor see Salim very      deliberately
     let go of her hand. Latika stumbles.

                                LATIKA
                  Jamal!

     Jamal scrambles to the rail. The train gains more
     speed. Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump,
     but Salim flings him backward. Jamal tries to scramble
     to his feet again, but Salim restrains him.

                                JAMAL
                  Got to go back. We've got to go
                  back.

                                SALIM
                  He'll kill us if we go back.
                  Jamal! He was going to take your
                  eyes out- with a bloody spoon!

     The train is speeding along. Jamal breaks free and
     stares back at Latika.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  She'll be alright. She always
                  is.

     Latika stumbles again and stops running. They watch as
     Punnoose catches up with her and stops running. He
     smashes Latika to the ground.


69   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                           69

                  hundred and fifty thousand
                  rupees: who wrote the famous
                  song Chalo Ri Murali. I should
                  warn you, Jamal: from this
                  question on, if you get the
                  answer wrong you lose
                  everything. So. Are you sure?
                  The life-lines are there....

                                JAMAL
                  Surdas.

     The lights dim, the music swells. Prem presses a button
     on his computer: looks him straight in the eyes for an
     age.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                       (simply)
                  Guess what? You're right.

     Applause, music, lights.


70   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             70

     The Inspector is eying Jamal, weighing it all up.

                                JAMAL
                       (shrugging)
                  Blind singers earn double. You
                  know that.

                                INSPECTOR
                  And what happened to the girl?
                  They blinded her too?

                                JAMAL
                       (shakes his head)
                  They had other plans. Though it
                  took me a long, long time to
                  find out.


71   EXT. TRAIN. MORNING.                                      71

     Salim and Jamal are sitting on top of the train. Jamal
     is staring blankly down the track.

                                  SALIM
                  Aré, Jamal...

     Salim puts an arm around Jamal's shoulder. Jamal wipes
     the tears from his eyes, shakes his head furiously.


     Salim gets up. Holds out his hand.

                                  SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Come.

                                JAMAL
                  Where you going?

                                SALIM
                  First class, bhai. Where else?

                                                        45.


72   INT/ EXT. FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE. MORNING.                  72

     The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A
     middle class Indian couple with their three children
     are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before
     them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes
     Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is
     clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train
     roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim
     who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open
     window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be
     hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.

     Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children
     spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,
     she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand
     which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,
     Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding
     onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.
     Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles
     and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and
     tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.
     Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are
     images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-

     - huddled together against the freezing rain...

     - surfing the wind at the front of the train...

     - admiring the distant Himalaya....

                             JAMAL V/O
               We criss-crossed the country
               from Rajasthan to Calcutta.
               Every time we were thrown off we
               got back on again. This was our
               home for years. A home with
               wheels and a whistle.

     The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground.


73   EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. DAY.                             73

     Groggily, Jamal sits up and groans. Somehow in the
     tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old.
     And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze
     of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the
     distance- something impossibly beautiful.

                             JAMAL
               Salim? Is this heaven?

                             SALIM
               You're not dead, Jamal.

     Jamal clears his head. Sees Salim picking himself up
     from the ground. But the apparition is still there.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         46.
73   CONTINUED:                                                73

                                JAMAL
                  So what's that?

                                SALIM
                  Wow.

     They stare at the apparition. The unmistakable outline
     of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the
     morning sun. Nothing could be more beautiful.

                                JAMAL
                  Some hotel, huh?


74   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY.                                      74

     Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj
     Mahal. Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive
     monument to love. It is a moment of genuine wonderment
     for them. Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists
     flowing behind him.

                                GUIDE
                  ...there are five main elements
                  to the Taj. The Darwaza, the
                  main gateway, the Bageecha or
                  garden, the Masjid or mosque,
                  the Naqqar Khana, the rest house
                  and the Rauza or mausoleum. If
                  you would like to follow me, I
                  will show you the ninety-nine
                  names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb.
                  As before, please remove your
                  shoes.

     Jamal follows the Guide and his entourage into the
     mausoleum. Salim meanwhile is studying the line of
     shoes. Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes,
     before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. A
     smile crosses his face. His other foot quickly follows
     and he saunters away, all mock-innocence.


75   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY                                       75

     Jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright
     sunlight and looks around for Salim. No sign of him.
     Suddenly, a German couple approach.

                                ADA
                  Please, what time is the next
                  tour?

                                JAMAL
                  Err-

                                PETER
                  - so much waiting around in this
                  damned country.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          47.
75   CONTINUED:                                                 75

     Jamal notices that he is standing next to a sign
     advertising guided tours of the Taj.

                                JAMAL
                  No, I-

                                ADA
                  - we're on a very tight
                  schedule, you see, young man.
                  Have to see the Red Fort this
                  afternoon. Would it be possible
                  to show us around now? Obviously
                  we understand it would cost more
                  for just the two of us...

     Peter waves a couple of thousand rupee notes at Jamal.
     His eyes widen.

                                JAMAL
                  But of course, Madam. Please
                  follow me.

     Jamal stalks off. The Germans follow. Jamal stops
     before the monument. Points a confident arm at it.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  This is....the Taj Mahal.

     A terrible pause as Peter and Ada stare at him. Clearly
     more is expected. He moves off at a pace.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  The Taj Mahal was built by the
                  Emperor Khurram for his wife
                  Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful
                  woman in the whole world. When
                  she died, the Emperor decided to
                  build this five star hotel for
                  everyone who wanted to visit her
                  tomb...but he died in- in
                  fifteen eighty-seven, before any
                  of the rooms were built. Or the
                  lifts. The swimming pool,
                  however, as you can see was
                  completed on schedule in top
                  class fashion.

     He waves confidently in the direction of the fountains.

                  With respect, Madam, the guide
                  book is written by a bunch of
                  lazy, good-for-nothing, Indian
                  beggars.

                    (nodding sagely)
               Exactly, Sir. She was on the way
               to the hospital when it
               happened.

     Jamal moves on. Ada and Peter exchange a glance.

               This is the Princess Diana seat,
               Madam. Allow me.

     Jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of Princess
     Diana, staring doe-eyed into the distance with the Taj
     behind. The tourist sits. Jamal adjusts her legs so
     that they match the postcard. Takes the photo....

     Jamal stands a Tourist on a wall and positions his
     hands to create the optical illusion that he is
     dangling the Taj from his fingers. Takes a photo for
     the Tourist. Behind the Tourist, Salim and a boy called
     Shankar pick up the Tourist's shoes and saunter
     casually across the grass.

     By the side of a busy market street Salim stands next
     to a row of stolen shoes. Sneakers, court shoes,
     sandals, high heels...he is busy bartering with a man
     over a pair whilst Jamal tries to shout up business.

                                JAMAL
                  Top-class fashion, bottom-class

79   EXT. BOYS CAMP, YAMUNA RIVER. DAY.                         79

     Hectares of drying clothes by the side of the river.
     Spectacular squares of red, saffron, white. Not far
     away from the dhobi ghat, there is a makeshift slum-
     camp where Salim and a gang of children are sitting,
     smoking. Jamal joins them, hands over a wad of rupees
     to Salim. Salim counts the cash, hands half to Shankar
     and slaps Jamal so hard on the back that he nearly
     falls over.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  And life was good.


80   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                            80

     Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian
     Man. A middle-aged American couple also get out. Jamal
     points them down a lane which opens out on India's
     largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating
     clothes on stone slabs.

                                JAMAL
                  This is the biggest dhobi ghat
                  in the whole of India, Mister

                  They say that every man in Uttar

                  has been washed here at least
                  one time.

                  Is that so? That's amazing.
                  Let's get a look at this, Adele.

     He gets out his video camera and wanders towards the
     dhobi ghat. Behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up.
     Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the
     Taj leap out. Within seconds, the Mercedes is up on
     bricks and the wheels are being removed. Salim takes a
     hacksaw to the Mercedes badge on the bonnet, whilst
     urging the others on.

                                SALIM
                  Aré, sala! Formula One, Formula
                  One! Pit-stop ka speed,
                  Schumacher ka ishtyle

     The crowds in the lane barely notice as the car is
     stripped of all its parts.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Go, go!

     A shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter,
     bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane. Jamal,
     the Indian driver and the two Americans return. They
     stop in front of the denuded car.

                                CLARK
                  Woah. What happened here?

     Suddenly the Indian driver is slapping Jamal
     ferociously around the head with one of his shoes.

                                DRIVER
                  I give you two tight slaps,
                  mader chod!

                  did I...? Nothing to do with
                  me...get off!

     But the beating continues, the driver kicking Jamal
     down onto the floor. The two Americans stare, uncertain
     what to do.

     Adele pulls out his wallet and rummages for dollars.


81   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                     81

     A battered Jamal limps along the river bank towards the
     Taj. He stops, bathes his swollen face in the river.
     Then looks up. Strange lights appear to emanate from
     the base of the monument. And then strange sounds.


82   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. NIGHT.                                        82

     Jamal climbs   a crumbling   wall and is confronted with an
     opera taking   place right   under the dome. Gluck's Orfeo
     ed Euridice.   Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals
     are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding
     frame.


83   EXT. STANDS. NIGHT.                                           83

     Jamal and a couple of street kids slip under the
     scaffolding supporting the banked seats. The street
     kids are trying to reach the hand-bags of the women
     above them.

                             BOY
                    (hissing)
               Oi, Jamal! There's a woman with
               no panties on over here.

     Jamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a man's
     trouser pocket. On stage, the actors start singing.
     Jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares,
     mesmerised, at the stage.

                             WOMAN
               Why don't you put it back and
               listen to the music?

     Jamal starts, makes to run, but the woman who spoke
     holds out a cigarette. A Canadian back-packer is
     sitting, staring at the singers.

                                WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  It's called Orfeo. Orpheus and
                  Eurydice. Orpheus- that one
                  there- is looking for his lover,
                  Eurydice. She died, but he can't
                  live without her.

     She hands him a cigarette. He puts the wallet back. She
     smiles at him and they both turn to the stage.

                                WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  The pain is so bad that he goes
                  to the underworld- the place we
                  go when we die- to try to get
                  her back.

                                JAMAL
                  You can't do that. Can you?

                  Watch and see.

     Jamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most
     beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear.
     Tears are running down Jamal's cheeks.


84   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                   84

     Salim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered
     around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot-
     wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels
     to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made
     hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of
     the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim
     is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his
     neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He
     takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the
     fire.

                                PREM
                  So, my friend: ready for another
                  question.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         54.

                                JAMAL
                  Yes.

     Prem presses his computer. The lights dim again, the
     music comes up.

                                PREM
                  For a straight one million
                  rupees, Ladies and
                  Gentlemen...On an American One
                  Hundred Dollar Bill there is a
                  portrait of which American
                  statesman? Is it A), George
                  Washington, B) Franklin
                  Roosevelt, C) Benjamin Franklin,
                  D) Abraham Lincoln?

     Silence from Jamal.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Pay or play, Jamal? All you have
                  to do is stop now and you walk
                  away with a cool quarter of a
                  million rupees. Decide to play,
                  get the answer wrong and you
                  walk away with absolutely
                  nothing. But, get the answer
                  right and you win a million
                  rupees. So. You decide. Pay or
                  play?

     A long pause.


86   INT. GALLERY. NIGHT.                                      86

                                DIRECTOR
                  Okay, he hasn't got a clue. This
                  is going to be a walk-away.
                  Stand by.

                                VISION MIXER
                  No, he's going to play with him,
                  first.


87   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       87

                                PREM
                  Get a lot of hundred dollar
                  bills in your line of work,
                  Jamal?

                                JAMAL
                  The minimum tip for my services.

     Laughter from the audience.

                                PREM
                  Now I know why my cell phone
                  bill is so high...they pay the
                  chi-wallah in hundred dollar
                  bills!

                                JAMAL
                  It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

     A gasp from the audience. Prem is caught off-guard.

                                PREM
                  Woah! We haven't locked the
                  computer, man. You're going to
                  play?

                                JAMAL
                  I think I just have. Haven't I?

                                PREM
                  You certainly have. C. Right?

                                JAMAL
                  Right. C.

                                PREM
                  Not confusing your Franklins?
                  Benjamin for Roosevelt?

                                JAMAL
                  I've never heard of Roosevelt
                  Franklin.

                                PREM
                  There's a million rupees at
                  stake and he's never heard of
                  Roosevelt Franklin...I can't
                  bear to look.

     He gives this one to the audience who titter on cue.
     Jamal looks confused.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  No, no. Don't you worry, Jamal.
                  You were asked which statesman
                  is depicted on a hundred dollar
                  bill. You said C. Benjamin
                  Franklin. Ladies and
                  Gentlemen...

     He presses the computer, pretends to ruminate for a
     while with his finger pressed to his lips.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Jamal Malik- you chose to play
                  not pay. I'm afraid you no
                  longer have two hundred and
                  fifty thousand rupees....

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           56.

     Prem leans over and tears up the cheque. There is a
     sigh of disappointment from the audience, a look of
     confusion on Jamal's face.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               ...you in fact have one million
               rupees!

     Wild applause from the audience. Jamal allows himself a
     genuine smile.


88   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               88

     The Inspector pulls out a note from his wallet. Glances
     at it.

                             INSPECTOR
               Who's on the thousand rupee
               note?

                               JAMAL
               I don't know.

     He waves the note at him.

                               INSPECTOR
               It's Gandhi!

                             JAMAL
               I've heard of him.

     The Inspector kicks his chair.

                             INSPECTOR
               Don't get clever or I'll get the
               electricity out again.

                             JAMAL
               They didn't ask me that
               question. I don't know why. Ask
               them.

     The Inspector stares hard at Jamal.

                             INSPECTOR
               Funny, you don't seem that
               interested in money.

     Then, Constable Srinivas stomps back into the office,
     sweat pouring from him.

                             CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
               Platform Seventeen-

     Has to consult his notebook.

89   EXT. BOMBAY. DAY.                                           89

     From a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the
     limitless megatropolis of Mumbai. Half-built sky-
     scrapers, slums, factories, roads, trains.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  Bombay had turned into Mumbai.

     We descend, down until the lines of ants become people.

                                JAMAL V/O (CONT'D)
                  The orphanage had gone, the slum
                  had gone, the people.... all
                  gone. And everywhere was
                  building, building, building.

     Descending even further, we pick out a construction
     site and then Jamal....


90   EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE. DAY.                                90

     ..who is staring through a wire fence at the
     construction site.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  But I knew she was here.
                  Somewhere she was here.

     He turns away, then something catches his eye.
     Underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a
     broken wall is a corner of something that Jamal
     recognises. He tears back a poster. Underneath, faded
     but recognisable is one of their beanbag graffiti
     advertisements.


91   EXT. SLUM. NIGHT.                                           91

     Jamal asks a group of stall-holders on the slum main
     street. They shrug, aren't interested. The camera pulls
     up and up until Jamal is nothing but a dot wandering
     the maze of lanes, railways and highways, one among
     endless millions of people.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  Evenings, I searched. Days, I
                  worked.

                                                           58.


92   EXT. HOTEL. DAY.                                            92

     Jamal wanders up to the rickshaw drivers parked outside
     the hotel. He stops and asks a question. The drivers
     shake their heads. Jamal continues up the steps towards
     a door, exhausted face and grubby clothes walking
     straight towards camera. He goes through the door and
     immediately....


93   INT. HOTEL. FOYER. DAY.                                     93

     ....is, without breaking step in a slightly grubby
     white uniform. He walks across the echoing, marble
     floor of a struggling four-star hotel, goes through
     double doors....


94   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.                                   94

     ...into a corridor that is devoid of carpet, paint-
     anything except a phone on the bare wall and a stool.
     The phone is ringing. Jamal sits on the stool and
     answers the phone.

                             JAMAL
               Room service, good afternoon?...
               Yes, sir. Two chicken burgers,
               two fries, one cocoa-cola and
               one mango lassi and a large
               bottle of mineral
               water...Bisleri or Himalayan
               Spring, Sir?...Certainly, Sir.
               That will be with you in fifteen
               minutes, Sir. Thank you. Have a
               nice day.

     He hangs up and goes through another set of doors...


95   INT. HOTEL KITCHENS. DAY.                                   95

     ...to a cramped kitchen with definite hygiene problems.
     The cooks are playing carom on the table while under it
     Salim is dozing.

                             JAMAL
               Two chicken burgers, coke, mango
               lassi and a bottle of Bisleri.

     Dozily, Salim gets up and takes a look behind one of
     the fridges. He chases out a chicken with a desultory
     kick and sorts through some empty mineral water bottles
     until he finds a Bisleri bottle. Salim fills the bottle
     of mineral water from the tap and begins delicately re-
     sealing the tamper-proof lid with super-glue. Jamal
     collects cutlery and starts laying out a tray.

                  I'm going to Chowpatti again,
                  okay? Want to come?

                                SALIM
                  For God's sake. You got some
                  disease? You force me back to
                  this shit-hole, we leave our
                  friends, a good life, loads of
                  money- for this. Isn't that
                  enough?

                                JAMAL
                  We came back to find her.

                                SALIM
                  No, you did, Jamal, not me. Me,
                  I don't give a shit about her.
                  Plenty of pussy in Bombay for
                  Salim. Oh, yes, sir! You should
                  come down the Cages on Saturday
                  night instead of searching for
                  your lost love.

                                JAMAL
                  I'm going to Chowpatti.

                       (impersonating Ram)
                  "I'm going to Chowpatti". There
                  are nineteen million people in
                  this city, Jamal. Forget her.
                  She's history.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  But she wasn't.


96   EXT. BANDRA BANDSTAND. DAY.                               96

     Jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He
     moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then
     he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked.
     It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not
     even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple
     of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He
     turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up
     against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older
     now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye-
     less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits
     until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless
     sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He
     turns and bows low, putting his hands together.

                                ARVIND
                  Namaste, Sahib. Any kindness you
                  give will be repaid in heaven
                  many times.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           60.
96   CONTINUED:                                                  96

     Jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts
     them into Arvind's outstretched hand. He feels the
     notes with his fingers.

                                ARVIND (CONT'D)
                  A fifty. And a hundred!
                  Blessings upon you, Sahib.

                                JAMAL
                  How do you know?

                                ARVIND
                  There are many ways of seeing.

     Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
     Then, Jamal takes his shoe off and gets out a hundred
     dollar bill.

                                 JAMAL
                  Here.

     Jamal crouches down and puts the bill into Arvind's
     hand. His fingers feel it. He sniffs it.

                                ARVIND
                  Dollars. But how many?

                                 JAMAL
                  One hundred.

                                ARVIND
                  Now you are playing with me,
                  Sahib.

                                 JAMAL
                  No. I swear.

                                ARVIND
                  What is on it? The pictures.
                  Tell me.

                                JAMAL
                  A building. With a clock on it.
                  Trees behind it.

                                ARVIND
                  The other side. Turn it over.

                                JAMAL
                  A man- it doesn't say his name.
                  He is sort of bald, but has long
                  hair on the sides.

                                ARVIND
                       (smiling)
                  Benjamin Franklin. My God, my
                  God. Thank you, Sahib. You were
                  generous the first time. But
                  this...

     He stops. Suspects.

                             ARVIND (CONT'D)
               And without even a song?

     A long pause. Arvind keeps hold of Jamal's arm.

                             ARVIND (CONT'D)
               So you are rich, now, are you,
               Jamal? I am happy for you.

                             JAMAL
               I am so sorry, Arvind.

                             ARVIND
               You got away. I didn't. That is
               all. No, no tears. Tears mock me
               all the more.

                             JAMAL
               Arvind, I am looking for-

                             ARVIND
               - how's your voice, Jamal?

                             JAMAL
               I don't know. I haven't sung
               since- since then. Arvind, I-

                             ARVIND
               - and your eyes?

                             JAMAL
                    (surprised)
               My eyes? My eyes are fine.

                             ARVIND
               Then stay away, chutiyé, and
               count your blessings every
               morning you open them and see
               the sun rising. You owe Maman.
               He doesn't forget.

                               JAMAL
               I owe Latika.

     Arvind shakes his head angrily.

                             JAMAL (CONT'D)
               Please. Is she alive? Arvind, is
               she alive?

                             ARVIND
               Alive? Oh, she's alive alright.
               It's your life, Jamal. Pila
               Street. They call her Cherry,
               now.

               Thank you.

     Jamal heads off through the traffic. Arvind shouts
     after him.

                             ARVIND
               I will sing at your funeral,
               yaar.


97   EXT. PILA STREET. NIGHT.                                    97

     Dark, crowded streets. Gangs of women stand outside the
     doorways or lean out of upstairs windows. They are
     garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to
     60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities,
     exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on
     the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway
     after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait
     for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of
     women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them
     something, as the women either shrug or offer them
     something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows.
     But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the
     street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from
     the group.


98   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                        98

     They go into one of the tiny houses. Loud Filmi music
     comes from upstairs. They are confronted by a woman in
     her fifties watching tv. She is less than interested.

                             SALIM
               I'm looking for Cherry.

                             WOMAN
               No, kid. Not available. Plenty
               of others. Take a look.

     She indicates curtained cubicles behind him.

                             SALIM
               I'm Latika's brother.

     The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.

                             WOMAN
               She's still not on the menu.
               Choose someone else or piss off.

     Then, Jamal pulls out some rupee notes.

                             JAMAL
               Just two minutes to talk to her.

     She takes the money, counts it.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              63.

                                  WOMAN
                   Two minutes.

      She nods upwards. Salim and Jamal head up the dark,
      tiny staircase. The Woman picks up the phone on her
      desk.


99    INT. LANDING. NIGHT.                                          99

      On the tiny landing, Salim and Jamal pull back a
      curtain to reveal a humping couple. They move on, past
      more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex,
      not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They
      reach the end of the landing. From the other side of
      the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to
      one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can
      see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika;
      though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she
      is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing,
      turquoise, silk sari.

                                 SALIM
                   Is it her or not?

      He shoves Jamal out of the way and watches.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Shit, she's sexy, man....

      Then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the
      limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard
      on Latika's hand.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   Smile! Flow, flow! You entice
                   with the hands not make
                   chapattis, you gawaar. Again.

      The man starts the music again and Latika's hands flow
      elegantly around her head.

                                 DANCE TEACHER (CONT'D)
                   Lift your feet, you lump. Stop,
                   stop!

      The stick is raised to hit her but Jamal opens the
      door.


100   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                          100

      She can barely believe her eyes.

                                  LATIKA
                   Jamal?

      The Dance Teacher turns.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                          64.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   What the hell do you want?

      He switches off the music.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come. Quick.

      But Latika remains fixed.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   You silly little boys. Get out
                   now while you can.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come with us.

      Latika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at
      the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from
      downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye
      bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.

                                 MAMAN
                   Look who we have here, Punnoose.
                   Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never
                   forget a face. Especially one
                   that I own.

                                 PUNNOOSE
                   Shall I take them to the
                   marshes?

                                 MAMAN
                   Whatever you like. Have fun.
                   Just make sure that you dispose
                   of them properly afterwards. No
                   traces, thank you.

      He turns to Jamal.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   You really thought you could
                   just walk in and take my prize
                   away? Have you any idea how much
                   this little virgin is worth,
                   bhen chod?

      He fingers Latika's hair.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Get them out of here.

      Punnoose and the Muscle walk towards Jamal. Maman turns
      to the Dance Teacher as they grab his arms.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Please continue, Master-ji.

      The Dance Teacher puts the music back on.

                                SALIM
                No.

      Suddenly, Salim is holding a pistol.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                Leave him. Get over there.

      Punnoose and the Muscle slowly release Jamal and join
      Maman.

                              MAMAN
                Let's not be foolish, Salim.
                Heavy, aren't they?

      Salim straightens up his gun arm.

                                SALIM
                Money.

                              MAMAN
                You can have money. Here.

      Maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in
      it on the floor.

                              MAMAN (CONT'D)
                Take it. Go. Disappear with your
                friend and we'll forget all
                about this. Okay?

      Salim collects up the money.

                              SALIM
                Maman never forgets. Isn't that
                right?

                              MAMAN
                Oh, Maman can make an exception.

      Salim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a
      cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman.

                              SALIM
                Can't take that risk, Maman.
                Sorry.

      He wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the
      trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a
      frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot.
      Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim
      fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up,
      giggles stupidly.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                Safety catch.

      Shrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more
      surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the
      floor, grabs Maman's wallet. Jamal just stands.

                               SALIM (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

      They run out of the room and down the stairs as Maman
      dies on the floor in front of his frozen colleagues.


101   EXT. CHOWPATTY BEACH. DUSK.                             101

      Children are splashing in the sea, flying kites,
      digging sand, laughing. Salim, Latika and Jamal are
      crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the
      sea. Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is
      fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out
      to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from
      a bottle of Johnny Walker.

                               LATIKA
                 Shit, there's thousands here.

                               SALIM
                 We should be celebrating.

                               JAMAL
                 You just killed somebody.

                               SALIM
                 He was going to kill us.

                               JAMAL
                 Where did you get the gun?

                               SALIM
                 Bought it. Now, I'm going to
                 have to throw this beauty in the
                 sea.

                               LATIKA
                 You didn't need to kill him.

                                SALIM
                 What? Typical. I save your life
                 and you're on at me. All you
                 ever do is mess us up. Whenever
                 you're around-

                               JAMAL
                 - shut up, can't you? Just shut
                 up.

      Silence.

                               SALIM
                 Why can't you just be happy,
                 huh?

                                    JAMAL
                    Happy?

                                  SALIM
                    You got what you wanted, didn't
                    you? So, let's celebrate.

                                  LATIKA
                    Yeah. Let's celebrate.

       She takes a long swig from the bottle.

                                    LATIKA (CONT'D)
                    While we can.

       She nudges Jamal and holds the bottle out to him.
       Smiles at him. He smiles back, shakes the black dog
       from his head and takes a long, long drink. Latika and
       Salim cheer.


101A   EXT. TULIP STAR. NIGHT.                              101A

       Latika, Salim and Jamal bend back a bit of the wire
       mesh fence that protects the deserted hotel. Crawl in.


102    INT. TULIP STAR. LOBBY. NIGHT.                           102

       A very wobbly Latika, Salim and Jamal walk up the
       frozen escalators of the empty hotel, lit only by
       security lights. Kick through the odd pile of rubbish
       and stacked-up chairs. Go to the dusty reception desk.

                                    JAMAL
                    Service!

                                    SALIM
                    Reception!

                                  JAMAL
                    We want a room, boy. Executive
                    Class with smoking. Third floor
                    with balcony.

                                  LATIKA
                    Sea-facing, yaar.

                                  SALIM
                    Have the bags brought up.

       And they scoot off, giggling into the dark.


102A   INT. TULIP STAR. KITCHENS. NIGHT.                    102A

       Jamal and Latika wander the vast, empty kitchens. Jamal
       searches the empty chillers and cabinets. Then,
       realises that he is alone.

                    Latika? Salim?

       Where are they? Suddenly,

                                     LATIKA
                    Room service!

       She comes shooting out of the darkness across the
       kitchen floor riding a trolley with Salim pushing her
       at top speed. Jamal has to skid out of the way. He
       grabs another trolley and glides off in pursuit.


102B   INT. TULIP STAR. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                       102B

       The three stand by a mirror and play with their
       reflections.


102C   INT. TULIP STAR. HOTEL LOBBY. LATER.                    102C

       On top of the metal preparation counters, Salim and
       Jamal are fencing: Jamal with a fish slice and Salim
       with a large spoon.


103    INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.                                  103

       An empty, dusty hotel suite. Jamal is on the phone.

                                  JAMAL
                    307 here. I want a bottle of
                    Johnny Walker Red Label, beer,
                    wine-

                                     LATIKA
                    - chicken.

                                  JAMAL
                    Ah! Chicken....

       Jamal closes his eyes at the wonderful thought.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    What kind of chicken?

                                  LATIKA
                         (also dreaming)
                    Tikka Masala. With roti-

                                  SALIM

                                  LATIKA
                    - aloo gobi, rice-

       She stops. Change of mind.

                                 JAMAL
                   Hold the line, chutiye.
                   Pop Tarts?

                                 LATIKA
                   On the tv. The commercial.
                   Everybody's happy when they have
                   Pop Tarts.

                                 JAMAL
                   Exactly! A bucket of Pop Tarts,
                   chutiye.

      Jamal slams down the phone.


104   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  104

      Latika is clearly in the shower. Jamal wanders in
      carrying an old pair of lunghi. Shouts through the
      door.

                                 JAMAL
                   Found some lunghi!

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   Stay there. Look away.

      The shower stops.

                                    JAMAL
                   Atcha, atcha.

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   I'll know if you're looking....

                                    JAMAL
                   I'm not!

      With a towel around her, Latika comes to the doorway
      where Jamal is holding out a the lunghi with his eyes
      tight shut.

                                    JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Where's Salim?

                                    LATIKA
                   Dunno.

      She watches this innocent a second with true fondness.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   You're a sweet boy, Jamal.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         70.
104   CONTINUED:                                            104

      She takes the lunghi from his outstretched hand and
      disappears into the bathroom, slamming the door with a
      giggle.


105   EXT. MUMBAI SLUM STREET. NIGHT.                          105

      Salim wanders the crowded streets of a slum. He stops
      uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are
      lolling, smoking. Plucks up his courage.

                                 SALIM
                   I'm looking for Javed-bhai.

                                 MAN
                   Ja, mada chod. He's not looking
                   for you. Ja!

                                 SALIM
                   I need to see him.

      The group of men stir, irritated now. Salim begins to
      back away, then stops. Pulls the gun from behind his
      back.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   I killed Maman. I'll kill you
                   too. Easy.

      The group are frozen.

                                 JAVED
                   You killed him?

      Javed is standing in the doorway.

                                 JAVED (CONT'D)
                   My enemy's enemy is my friend,
                   no? So, come in, friend.


106   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  106

      Jamal and Latika lie on the bed, drunk, though still
      coherent. Latika is dressed in the Bell-Boy's jacket
      and the old lunghi.

                                 LATIKA
                   Maman's gang will hunt us. You
                   know that?

                                   JAMAL
                   I don't care.

                                   LATIKA
                   Me neither.

      They burst into stupid laughter. The laughter subsides.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           71.

                                 JAMAL
                   That dance you were doing. In
                   Pila Street. Show me.

      Latika rolls over and switches off the light. Rolls
      back. In the half light, her hands begin to move for
      Jamal, the elegant, alluring hand movements of the bar-
      girl dancers. Jamal stares, mesmerised.

                                 LATIKA
                   You came back for me.

                                   JAMAL
                   Of course.

                                 LATIKA
                   I thought you'd forgotten.

                                 AMIR
                   I never forgot. Not for one day.
                   I knew I'd find you in the end.
                   It's our destiny.

                                   LATIKA
                   Destiny. Yes.

      Latika stops her hands. They stare at each other, their
      faces inches away from each other. Latika strokes
      Jamal's face.

                                   LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

      And face to face, they slowly fall asleep.


107   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                 107

                                   SALIM
                   Hey.

      Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,
      swaying with alcohol.

                                   JAMAL
                   Salim?

      He puts his hand out to Latika.

                                   SALIM
                   Come.

                                 JAMAL
                   No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a
                   lot to drink...

      Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his
      throat and pushes him down on the bed.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.
107   CONTINUED:                                             107

                                 SALIM
                   I am the elder. And I am the
                   boss. For once, you do as I say.

                                    JAMAL
                   No.

      Salim pulls Latika to her feet.

                                 SALIM
                   I saved your bloody life, didn't
                   I?

                                    LATIKA
                   Salim, please-

                                    SALIM
                   - chup, sali.

      As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps
      on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of
      course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches
      herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost
      delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the
      door, laughing.


108   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                            108

      Salim throws him out into the corridor, slams the door.

                                 SALIM
                   I am Number One now!

                                 JAMAL
                   Salim, no, no....!

                                 SALIM
                   Get yourself a room, bhai.

      Salim slams the door. Jamal gets up, bangs on the door,
      keeps on banging until the door opens and Salim stands
      there with the pistol pointing straight at Jamal's
      head.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   The man with the Colt 45 says
                   chup.

      He shoves Jamal hard down the corridor, the gun pointed
      at him all the while.

                                    JAMAL
                   Salim...

      Salim nods towards the fire escape door.

                   Now go. Or Gunmaster G-9 will
                   shoot you right between the
                   eyes. Boom. Don't think he
                   won't. You have five seconds.
                   One, two, three, four-

      Salim cocks the pistol. Jamal screws up his eyes for
      the inevitable. But Salim shoves him out with a roar
      and slams the door. Jamal bangs on the door.

                                 JAMAL O/S
                   Salim...

      Salim walks slowly back down the corridor as Jamal
      bangs and bangs on the door. Down the hall, Salim's
      door shuts.


109   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            109

      The Inspector is staring hard at Jamal. Srinivas is
      desperately trying to get his attention.

                   Accessory to murder, Sir.

      The Inspector puts his hands in the air, palms up.
      Simple.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Only the finest minds in the
                   Mumbai Police Force.

      Untroubled by irony, Srinivas looks extremely pleased.

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   Go check the files, Constable.

      Srinivas goes out.

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   You puzzle me, Slumdog.
                   Admitting murder to avoid a
                   charge of fraud is not exactly
                   clever thinking. Now, why would
                   you do that?

      Jamal shrugs.

                                 JAMAL
                   When somebody asks me a
                   question, I tell them the
                   answer.


110   EXT. TULIP STAR. MORNING.                                110

      At the gate, a Security Guard is sitting in his chair.

                                 JAMAL
                   Where are they?

      The Guard grunts.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Where did they go?

      A more impatient grunt from the Guard. He stands up,
      walks towards Jamal.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Please, Sir. Which way?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   I don't know and I don't care.

      The Guard raises his stick and gives him a roar. Jamal
      backs away onto the street. The Guard slams the gate
      shut. Jamal looks despairingly up and down the street
      at the teeming traffic, the crowds.

                                 PREM V/O
                   Ready for another question.

                                 JAMAL V/O
                   Yes. I'm ready.

112   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      112

      We are back in the Studio.

                                 PREM
                   For two and a half million

                   City. Is it A) Oxford, B) Leeds,
                   C) Cambridge, D) London.

      Jamal smiles.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   He's smiling. Why does that
                   worry me?

                                                         75.


113   EXT. MUMBAI. DAY.                                        113

      Leaden skies. Torrential rain is hammering on the tin
      roofs of the slum.


114   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         114

      Eighteen year-old Jamal's eyes open. Now with the
      beginnings of a beard and moustache, Jamal wakes in a
      tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor.
      He pulls on a shirt, lifts the mattress and takes out
      his trousers which have been pressing there all night,
      puts them over his shoulder, picks up his shoes and
      goes down a ladder.


115   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         115

      He descends into a room and two feet of water that is
      eddying around the ground floor of the shack. Wades out
      of the door into the narrow lane of the slum.


116   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                          116

      Jamal nods hello to a number of neighbours, also bare-
      legged, also with their shoes in hand. Together, they
      wade to higher ground, put on their trousers and shoes
      and trudge up to the main road.


117   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                 117

      Ultra-modern, glass-windowed office. The words Cultural
      Studies are written on the white board. Jamal walks in
      with a tray of glasses of chi. He puts a glass down on
      the young, hip, Teacher's desk and heads out again.

                              TEACHER
                Okay, guys, it's been a big week
                in UK. Kat is back.

      He holds up a copy of Radio Times showing Kat from East
      Enders smiling at them. A collective groan from the
      Trainees.

                              BARDI
                She's already back.

                                 TEACHER
                Bardi...Jamal?

                              JAMAL
                Oh. Well. She did come back,
                then she went away when Alfie
                split up with her and now she's
                back again.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   But it looks as if Alfie still
                   fancies Mo after all, so-

                                 TEACHER
                   - thank you, Jamal. Keep up,
                   Bardi. The chi-wallah knows more
                   than you.

      Bardi glares at Jamal. Jamal shrugs apologetically and
      goes out.

                                 TEACHER (CONT'D)
                   Okay, it's been super-duper hot
                   for UK this week, so there'll be
                   a lot of chat about that- they
                   love their weather- and there's
                   the festival in Edinburgh-
                   Edinburgh?

      He points at a young woman Trainee.

                                 NASREEN
                   Scotland. Kilts, castles, err,
                   haggis? Porridge, the Highlands,
                   mountains. Ben- Ben Nevis?

      The Teacher points at another Trainee.

                                 TRAINEE 2
                   Detective Taggart. Whisky, Sean
                   Connery!

                                 TEACHER
                   And lochs. Their word for lakes.
                   Good. It's also double bonus
                   time for an upgrade to the
                   `friends and family' package
                   this week, so remember to push
                   for an upgrade...

                                    EVERYONE
                   ...Every Call!

      Jamal walks out, turns a corner.


118   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                       118

      We are confronted with a room you could swing a Boeing
      in. Rows and rows of Operators in tiny booths stretch
      into the distance. On the walls are pictures of London,
      Tony Blair, red telephone boxes, the Yorkshire Dales,
      the Highlands- a snapshot of tourist Britain. Huge
      posters of soap stars and celebrities adorn the rest of
      the walls. Slogans hang from the ceiling. "When the sun
      comes up, you'd better be running", "you snooze, you
      lose", "Upgrade for a better, faster life." "Every call
      is a new opportunity".

118   CONTINUED:                                             118

      Each section of the room has a banner with a British
      city's name on it and various mock sign-posts for the
      different aisles. A Manager under the banner
      "Bradford", is standing over an Operator, listening in
      on a call. The Manager leans over and presses a key.

                                 MANAGER
                   If they want an upgrade, a new
                   tariff or we're stealing them
                   from the other networks, you
                   take the call. Anything else-

      He mimes cutting his throat.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                   No time-wasters on Team
                   Bradford, kid. Leave that to the
                   homosexuals on Tunbridge Wells.

      Jamal stops by him. The Manager takes a glass of tea
      from Jamal.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                   Where've you been? Dave on
                   Cornmarket's virtually lost his
                   voice, there's two on Ilkley
                   Moor who've had their hands up
                   for hours. Come on, move it!

      Jamal hurries down the aisle signposted "Cornmarket",
      gets to a male trainee and hands him a tea. Dave
      glances around to check nobody's looking and slips off
      his head-set.

                                 DAVE
                   Two minutes, Jamal. I'm on
                   "Millionaire" duty.

                                  JAMAL
                   Rajneesh...

                                 DAVE
                   It's my turn, Jamal. I've had my
                   pee breaks. Please. If he comes
                   just keep your head down and
                   pretend you're doing an upgrade
                   on the-

                                 JAMAL
                   - `friends and family'. I know.

      Jamal still looks unwilling.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Two minutes.

      Dave heads off towards a Rest and Recreation room,
      where a big plasma screen on the wall is showing "Who
      Wants To Be A Millionaire."Jamal grabs the jacket from
      the back of Dave's chair, puts the head-set on and
      hunches over the booth, just another Operative at work.
      We become aware that every operator down the Cornmarket
      aisle- and quite a few other aisles besides- is staring
      in the direction of the Rest and Recreation Room.


119   INT. REST AND RECREATION ROOM. NIGHT.                 119

      Dave is watching the screen.

                              PREM
                ...if you want a chance to be a
                contestant on Who Wants To Be A
                Millionaire, dial the number
                now.

      Dave dives for the doorway and waves.


120   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                    120

      Suddenly all the operators are dialling. Almost
      simultaneously, twenty or so voices say.

                              OPERATORS
                I'd like to be a contestant on
                Who Wants to be a Millionaire.

      Most of the Operators- including the man next to Jamal-
      suddenly lose their tension.

                              OPERATOR
                Bloody bastard. I never get it.

                              JAMAL
                You have to dial when Prem says
                "if". "If you want the chance to
                be a contestant on Who Wants To
                Be A Millionaire..." That's when
                they open the lines.

      The Operator looks at him. Jamal shrugs.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                That's what Anjum in Technical
                says. He put the system in.

                              OPERATOR
                So why don't you?

                              WOMAN V/O
                Hello? Hello? Have I been
                transferred again, for God's
                sake?

      Jamal freezes with fear. The head-set speaks again with
      its broad Scottish accent.

                                 WOMAN V/O (CONT'D)
                   Hello? Jesus, God, will somebody

                   Hello, Mrs...

      He stares at the computer.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   ...Mackintosh from King Gussie.

                   So where are you from? Abroad, I
                   bet. China or somewhere. What
                   good is-

                                 JAMAL
                   - just down the road from your
                   house, Mrs Mackintosh. Next to
                   the loch.

                                 WOMAN V/O
                        (suspicious)
                   Oh aye? Which loch?

      Jamal searches desperately around, spots a picture of
      Big Ben.

                                 JAMAL
                   Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to
                   Detective Taggart's flat.

                                 WOMAN V/O
                   Loch Ben? Och, no, hen, that's
                   one of the wee ones up in the
                   Highlands. You're all the way up
                   there? But I bet it rains, eh,
                   hen?

                                 JAMAL
                   Indeed yes, Mrs Mackintosh. I
                   have to wade through a metre of
                   water every morning.

                Yes, yes, Mrs Mackintosh. In my
                kilt.

                                WOMAN V/O
                Och, no, hen.

      Jamal puts his feet on the desk.

                              JAMAL
                It's alright once I've had my
                porridge, my haggis and a few
                Scotch whiskies- and the
                monsoon's nearly over, so-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - and what monsoon would that
                be? I'd like to speak to your
                supervisor, son.

                              JAMAL
                I don't think that's a good
                idea. He is a very important
                man, Mrs Mackintosh-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - get me the supervisor on this
                line now-

                              JAMAL
                - and he doesn't like bloody
                time wasters.

      Jamal panics, presses the button he saw the Manager
      press earlier. The screen goes blank, then reboots
      itself. Jamal looks around. Where the hell is Dave? On
      the screen, Jamal is faced with the question: "what
      name do you require?" He looks around again, and then
      with one finger types in the word "Latika". He presses
      enter. Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their
      surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He
      erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik.
      Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up. He stares at
      the numbers for a long time, then types it into his
      computer and presses dial.

                                MAN V/O
                Yeah?

                                JAMAL

                              MAN V/O
                Who wants to know? Do you know
                what bloody time it is?

      Clearly not Jamal's brother. Jamal cuts the line. Dials
      the next number.

      Clearly not his Salim. He cuts the line. Dials again.

                 Hello? Hello? Who is this?

      But Jamal can't speak.

                 Hey. Is someone screwing with
                 me?

                 I am calling from XL 5

                 Jamal? Is that you? Brother?
                 Where are you, man?...I thought
                 you were dead or something...we
                 had to go, Jamal. Maman's guys.
                 They were searching the
                 hotel...Jamal, say something.
                 Please.

      There is another long silence.

      A flash of a sign post reading `Oxford Circus',
      pointing down one of the aisles. The banner above that
      section of the warehouse reads `London'.

      Jamal hurrying down another `Kings Parade' carrying
      glasses of tea. He glances up to see a large banner
      that says `Cambridge'.

      Jamal comes back up an aisle named `Broad Street'. An
      Operator on the adjacent `The High' clicks his fingers
      for another cup. Jamal hurries under the sign marked
      `Oxford'.

                                                      CUT TO:

      The signposts of the aisles come faster and faster
      `Pembroke Street', `Trafalgar Square', `East India
      Dock' and finally `Cambridge Circus'.

      Jamal is sweating, his face scrunched up in thought.

                                 JAMAL
                   I can't remember.

                   I don't think it's Oxford.

                                 PREM
                   Based on your extensive

                        (almost to himself)
                   Well, Oxford has Broad Street,
                   Saint Aldates, Turl Street,
                   Queen Street, The High and
                   Magdalene Bridge- which is
                   pronounced Maudlin, so-

      He stops as he hears the surprised laughter of the
      audience.

                   I thought you hadn't been to UK.

                                 JAMAL
                   Oh, I haven't. And it's not
                   Leeds, because that's Elland
                   Road, Kirkgate Market,
                   Commercial Street, St Peter's-

                                 PREM
                        (icy)
                   - what might it be then, Jamal?

                                 JAMAL
                   Well, I don't think it's
                   Cambridge.

                                 PREM
                   Cambridge Circus is not in
                   Cambridge? Dare I ask why?

                                 JAMAL
                   Too obvious. There's definitely
                   an Oxford Circus in London, and
                   there's a rowing race between
                   Oxford and Cambridge so there's
                   probably a Cambridge Circus too.
                   I'll go for D) London.

                                 PREM
                   That's the logic that's got him
                   this far, Ladies and Gentlemen.
                   Who are we to argue? So. Jamal.

                    It was self-defence.

                                 DIRECTOR
                   Bloody hell. He's got Prem on
                   the run...


128   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      128

      Music, lights. Prem presses his computer.

                                 PREM
                   What sports do you play?

                                 JAMAL
                   None.

                                 PREM
                   None. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh
                   dear. Not to worry, there's only
                   ten million rupees at stake...
                   Which cricketer has scored the
                   most first class centuries in
                   history. Was it A) Sachin
                   Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)
                   Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

      Prem allows the question to sink in.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   You've got a cheque for five
                   million rupees in your hands.
                   You've still got two life-lines,
                   Phone A Friend and 50/50. For
                   ten million rupees: pay, play,
                   or bail out. It's still an
                   option. Remember, if you get the
                   answer wrong, you will lose
                   everything like that.

      He clicks his fingers.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure you want to do
                   this?


129   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                129

      An Indian batsman hits a nicely-timed stroke, heads
      down the wicket for a single. Turns. The other batsman
      is taking a second run.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

129   CONTINUED:                                            129

      The Indian tries to halt the other batsman with a
      shout, then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down
      the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball at the stumps. The
      bails fly off.


130   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     130

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll play.

      Tense laughter from the audience. Prem holds up the
      cheque. Jamal nods. Prem tears it up slowly. Allows the
      pieces to fall to the floor.

                                 PREM
                   The dreams of so many. On the
                   floor.


131   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. DAY.                                  131

      Jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a
      high building, still just a shell but buzzing with
      carpenters, bricklayers, cable-layers. The lift stops
      at the top. Jamal gets out. Looks around. He is miles
      up. Alone.

                                 SALIM
                   Jamal!

      Jamal looks around. There is Salim standing on the edge
      of the building. He saunters over to Jamal, his arms
      outstretched in theatrical greeting. He is groomed,
      expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy
      dangling from a gold chain around his neck.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   God is good, bhai. God is good.

      He tries to embrace Jamal. With as much force as he can
      muster, Jamal punches him in the face. Salim takes it.
      Stands there. Wipes blood from his lip. Gets another
      punch. Then another and another, not even defending
      himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging
      Jamal towards the edge of the building. Finally, he
      tries to reason with Jamal

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Maman's boys were after us. Had
                   to skip.

      Jamal keeps on beating him back.

                                 JAMAL
                   Liar.

                                  SALIM
                    Left a message at reception.
                    Waited weeks for you in Nagpur.

                                  JAMAL
                    There was no message at
                    reception.

                                  SALIM
                    Bhai, I left a message.

       Salim opens his arms, defenceless. It would take one,
       small push to send him over the edge. There is a
       moment, when Jamal might. He even has his hands on his
       chest.

                                  JAMAL
                    I will never forgive you.

                                  SALIM
                    I know.

       The fury in Jamal subsides minutely. Finally, he turns
       away with a roar of frustration. Salim hangs his head.


131A   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. LATER.                              131A

       Jamal and Salim are sitting on the very edge of the
       building. They can see for miles across the city. Salim
       has rediscovered his attitude.

                                  SALIM
                    Can you believe it? This was our
                    slum. We lived just there, huh?
                    Now it is business, apartments,
                    call centres...Fuck USA, fuck
                    China. India is at the centre of
                    the world, now, bhai. And I am
                    at the centre of the centre,
                    Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's.

                                  JAMAL
                    Javed Mehta? The Gangster from
                    our slum? You work for him?

                                  SALIM
                    Who else would protect us from
                    Maman's gang, huh?

                                  JAMAL
                    What do you do for him?

                                  SALIM
                    Anything he asks.

       Salim's mobile rings. Salim is immediately subservient
       on the phone. Rings off.

                    He is coming. You must go. My
                    card.

       He hands Jamal a card.

                                  JAMAL
                    What for?

                                  SALIM
                    You think I am going to let you
                    out of my sight again, little
                    brother? You stay with me now.
                    Ab phut!

                                  JAMAL
                    Salim, where's Latika?

                                  SALIM
                    Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long
                    gone. Now go. Quick.

       Jamal gets up, hurries away, hidden behind piles of
       building materials just as Javed appears in his flash
       suit and jewelry. Three of his young henchmen walk
       alongside.



132    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT.    NIGHT.                        132

       Jamal is asleep on a mattress on the floor of a smart
       apartment. A mobile phone rings. The muffled sound of
       Salim talking quietly next door. Then, Salim creeps
       into the room, checks to see Jamal is asleep, unlocks a
       desk drawer and brings out his pistol. He puts it in a
       hold-all and goes out the front door. Jamal's eyes snap
       open. He has seen it all.

                                  JAMAL V/O
                    Slum dogs never sleep, only nap.
                    He would disappear for a couple
                    of days and come back changed.
                    Sometimes elated-


133    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           133

       The door bangs open and a giggling-drunk, half-naked
       Bar Girl drags the sleeping Jamal up and into the
       bathroom.

                                  BAR GIRL
                    He has flipped! I can't do
                    anything with him....

       Salim is in the bath, bathing, literally, in money.

                                 JAMAL V/O
                   Sometimes the opposite.

      Jamal creeps towards Salim's bedroom door. He pushes it
      open a fraction to see Salim crouched on the floor in
      prayer, sobbing quietly.

                                 SALIM
                        (whispering)
                   Aé khuda mujhé baksh dé mainé

                                 JAMAL V/O
                   But younger brothers don't
                   interfere. Mostly.


135   EXT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. DAY.                             135

      Salim comes out of his apartment block. Gets into his
      jeep. Drives off. Doesn't notice Jamal in the motor
      rickshaw that pulls out and follows him.


136   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              136

      Salim approaches a gate-house to a large bungalow. The
      Door-Keeper nods to him, rings a bell. From the
      rickshaw, Jamal watches a woman come to the door.
      Latika. Eighteen, completely beautiful and rich. She
      hands Salim a package and goes back inside. Salim gets
      in his jeep and drives away.


137   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              137

      Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.

                                 JAMAL
                   Baba, I am the new cook from the
                   agency. A thousand apologies, I
                   am late for the Memsaab.

      The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief
      pause, he returns.

                                 DOOR-KEEPER
                   She doesn't know anything about
                   any cook. There's supposed to be
                   a dishwasher being delivered.
                   Know anything about that?

      The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.
      Latika appears at the gate.

                                 LATIKA
                   Haven't I told you, don't
                   interrupt when I'm watching-

      She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   - come inside. I'll show you the
                   kitchen.


138   INT. KITCHEN. DAY.                                       138

      Latika and Jamal go into the kitchen. Who Wants To Be A
      Millionaire plays on the tv in the background. She
      turns and hugs him tight. They laugh with happiness.

                                 LATIKA
                        (delighted)
                   Jamal, Jamal, look at you...!

      Their heads are close, they might kiss. Then Latika
      turns away, stares out of the window.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   Aré wa, Jamal....

      Jamal smiles hopefully at her. But there is sadness in
      her now. She takes her sunglasses off, rubs her eyes.
      There is a bruise there.

                                 JAMAL
                   You've hurt your eye.

                                 LATIKA
                   Why are you here?

                                 JAMAL
                   To see you.

                                 LATIKA
                   Well. You see me.

      She stands there, challenging. On the tv, somebody is
      winning money.

                                 JAMAL
                   Why does everyone love this

                   it? Walk into another life.
                   Doesn't everyone want that?

                                 JAMAL
                   You have another life. A rich

                   You don't look so happy with a
                   black eye.

                                 LATIKA
                   You turn up here out of nowhere,
                   telling me I'm not happy: how
                   dare you?

      Voices at the gate-house.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   God, Javed will kill you. Here.

                                 JAMAL
                   Javed? You are with him?

      She throws him an apron. He gets it on just in time for
      Javed to walk in. Jamal turns away.

                                  JAVED
                   First you want a dishwasher, now
                   a bloody cook-

                   - chup. The cricket's on.

      Javed changes channel and dials on his mobile.

                                 JAVED (CONT'D)
                   Why do you always watch that
                   shit? Huh? I'm already a
                   millionaire.

      He laughs at his own joke. Turns to Jamal.

                              JAVED (CONT'D)
                Well, come on then, Cook. I'm
                hungry. Get me a sandwich.

                              JAMAL
                Immediately, Sir.

      Javed stares at Jamal a moment, trying to place a face
      he vaguely recognises. Then the Bookie comes on the
      line and he turns back to the television.

                              JAVED
                Atcha...

      Latika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and
      condiments, whispering while Javed talks on the phone.

                              JAMAL
                Come away with me.

                              LATIKA
                Chutiyé. Away where? And live on
                what? What can you provide? What
                have you got, Jamal?

                              JAMAL
                Love.

                ..yeah. He's on eighty-five. I
                want four lakh on him making a
                century. What are you
                giving?...Okay, make it five
                lakh.

      Javed pours himself a glass of whisky, never taking his
      eyes from the television.

                              TV COMMENTATOR
                We are watching history unfold
                today at the Wankhedé Stadium as
                Sachin Tendulkar carves his way
                towards another magnificent
                century and the record books.
                His thirty-eighth century- the
                most by any Indian cricketer
                ever...

                It won't buy you a new
                dishwasher, but it might make
                you happy.

                Where have you been? Get in the
                real world, Jamal.

                              JAMAL
                You and me. That is the real
                world. Come away with me.

      Latika snatches the sandwich from him and gives it to
      Javed. Goes back to Jamal, whispers under cover of
      putting condiments away.

                                LATIKA
                You're crazy.

                              JAMAL
                Salim will help us.

                               LATIKA
                Salim? You still believe in
                Salim? Jamal...I'll be gone
                soon, anyway. Bombay's got too

                Straight bat, straight bat,
                dammit.

      Then the batsman at the other end calls to take a
      second run.

                                JAVED (CONT'D)
                No! A single!

      Tendulkar seems to agree, tries to halt the other
      batsman with a shout, then succumbs to the inevitable
      and charges down the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball
      at the stumps. The bails fly off.

                              JAVED (CONT'D)
                No, no, no! stupid ben chod
                idiot...

      He flings his glass of whisky at the television.
      Suddenly tastes what he has been eating.

                              JAVED (CONT'D)
                And what is this shit supposed

      Javed throws the sandwich at him and slams out of the
      room. His footsteps can be heard stomping into another
      room.

                              LATIKA
                Now go, before he kills us both.

      She leads Jamal to the door.

                              JAVED
                Latika, where's my bloody shirt?
                The Armani.

      Latika shouts over her shoulder.

                              LATIKA
                Coming!

      Back to Jamal.

                              LATIKA (CONT'D)
                     (whispered)
                You want to do something for me?

                              JAMAL
                Anything.

                              LATIKA
                Then forget me.

                              JAMAL
                I'll wait at VT station. Five
                o'clock every day until you
                come.

      She shakes her head.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                I love you.

                              LATIKA
                So what, Jamal? So what?
                (loudly)
                Now, get out and tell your no-
                good agency not to send anybody
                else until they've learnt to
                cook. You hear?

      She slams the door. Hurries back into the kitchen,
      throws Javed's plate into the sink. The Door-keeper
      comes in.

                              DOOR-KEEPER
                Madam, your dishwasher has
                arrived.

      Leaning over the sink, Latika weeps silently.

                                                         96.


139   INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           139

      Salim has his hand around Jamal's throat.

                              SALIM
                Why can't you let it alone? You
                want money, I'll give you money.
                Girls? I can get you girls.

                              JAMAL
                You know what I want.

                              SALIM
                You're like some crazy man-
                you're obsessed.

                              JAMAL
                She is my destiny, Salim.

                              SALIM
                Know what your destiny is, crazy
                boy? A bullet between the eyes.
                And after that, he'll kill her.
                Is that what you want? Huh?

                              JAMAL
                Me, I don't care. Latika? She's
                already half dead.

      Salim takes his hand away from Jamal's neck.

                              SALIM
                Yes. About that, you are right.

                                JAMAL
                You sold her.

                              SALIM
                     (fierce)
                I didn't sell her. Javed wanted
                her. He gets what he wants.

      He turns away bitterly.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                She's doing alright. Get it into
                your thick head, Jamal. She's
                not yours and she never will be.

      The lights flick back on. Prem slumps back in his
      chair.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   You've got the luck of the

                   Oh, the toilet. Sure. Naveed,
                   Jamal wants the bog.

      The Floor Manager and a Security Guard usher Jamal off-
      stage. Prem looks up at the gallery, raises his eyes at
      the Director. Some show. Then he gathers himself and
      heads off-stage.


141   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 141

      The clock reads five oh three. Jamal stands on the
      footbridge. Humanity washes around him. His eyes dart
      around, frightened to miss her. Checks the clock again.
      Six. The platform is almost deserted. He wanders away.


142   INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                                   142

      Prem wanders down the corridor followed by a Security
      Guard. Another Security Guard is waiting at the
      entrance to the toilet. Prem goes in, leaving the two
      Guards in the corridor.


143   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 143

      Jamal stands on the footbridge gazing down at the
      hordes of commuters. Five o'clock, five fifteen, five
      thirty. Six. Jamal rests his head against the railings.


144   INT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                     144

      Jamal is in one of the cubicles. Prem goes to the
      urinal. Unzips.

                   A guy from the slums becomes a

                    You've said that before, yaar.

       Prem finishes pissing. Goes over to the washbasins,
       runs the taps and washes his hands.

                                  JAMAL O/S
                    No, I really don't.

                                  PREM
                    What? You can't take the money
                    and run now. You're on the edge
                    of history, kid!

                    Maybe it is written, my friend.
                    You're going to win this. Trust
                    me, you're going to win.

       Prem leaves. Jamal flushes and comes out of the
       cubicle. Goes to the washbasins. In the mist on the
       mirror above the taps is written the letter "B". Jamal
       stares at it. Gradually it fades, leaving only the
       growing fury on his face staring back at him.


145    INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      145

       Jamal stalks back onto the set. Sits down in his chair.
       Stares at Prem who looks unconcernedly back.

                    Twenty seconds.


145A   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 145A

       The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
       descending river of people out of his way, the
       seventeen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps
       that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of
       the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He
       scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her:
       the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly
       beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world
       away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

                                  JAMAL
                    Latika! Latika!

       But though he is screaming her name, his voice is
       swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
       thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                   JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika!

       Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one
       figure against an army of white-robed people. He gets
       to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against
       the tide. But so are the two men. Jamal is now on the
       same platform. Shouts her name again. She turns with a
       smile. But the two Thugs leap through a train onto her
       platform. She sees them, starts running, is lost in the
       crowd. Jamal runs off along the platform after Latika.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika! Latika!


       By the time Jamal has fought himself to where Latika
       was- she is gone. He whirls around, mad with
       frustration.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika! Latika!

147    EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                  147

       Latika is jumping the tracks, crossing in front of
       trains. But the Thugs are gaining on her. He brings her
       down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes.
       Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the
       crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the
       car.

                                   JAMAL
                    Salim!

       Salim spits disgustedly on the ground. Gets in. Latika
       twists her head to see Jamal as the car skids off.
       Jamal screams with hopeless fury.

       Jamal and Prem stare at each other. Prem smiles.

                                 PREM
                   Welcome back to Who Wants to Be
                   A Millionaire? In the chair
                   tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we
                   don't know! In an amazing run,
                   Jamal has already five million
                   rupees but, not content with
                   that, has chosen to gamble for
                   one Crore- that's ten million
                   million rupees. What a player!
                   The question one more time:
                   Which cricketer has scored the
                   most first class centuries in
                   history. Was it A) Sachin
                   Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)
                   Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

                                 JAMAL
                   I know it isn't Sachin
                   Tendulkar.

                                 PREM
                   That's a start. So, it could be
                   Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or
                   Michael Slater.

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll use a life-line. Fifty-
                   fifty.

                                  PREM
                   Okay. Computer, take away two
                   wrong answers.

      Music swells, lights dim.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                Well, you were right about
                Sachin Tendulkar. The computer
                has taken away A) Sachin
                Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.
                That leaves you a fifty-fifty
                choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting
                or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you
                think? Decision time. For half a
                million rupees. Your answer: B)
                Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.

      A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into
      Prem's eyes.

                                 JAMAL
                D.

      A barely perceptible jump from Prem.

                              PREM
                You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?
                The Australian? Great cricketer.

                                 JAMAL
                D. Jack Hobbs.

                                 PREM
                Do you know?

      Jamal shakes his head.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

                              JAMAL
                Or D. Jack Hobbs.

                                 PREM
                Final Answer?

                              JAMAL
                Final Answer. D.

      A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.

                              PREM
                Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.

      Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                With one hundred and ninety-
                seven first class centuries, the
                answer is...D. Jack Hobbs!

      The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.

      The camera goes off Prem for a second. He mimes a
      disgusted spit. Then he is back on.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                I cannot believe what I am
                seeing here, tonight, Ladies and
                Gentlemen....So, are you ready
                for the final question for two
                Crore rupees- twenty million
                rupees?

                              JAMAL
                Not really, but...maybe it is
                written, no?

                              PREM
                Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For
                twenty million rupees, the final
                question on Who Wants to be a
                Millionaire?

      The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.
      Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into
      nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I
                would need a pacemaker fitted,
                we're out of time! What a show,
                Ladies and Gentlemen, what a
                show. Join us tomorrow night to
                see if Jamal Malik has made the
                biggest mistake of his life or
                has just won the biggest prize
                in the history of Indian
                television....Same place, same
                time. You wouldn't dare miss it.
                Goodnight!

      Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off
      his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up
      and pulls out his mobile.


149   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              149

      Waving a kitchen knife in on hand, a desperate Jamal
      slams through the gates of Javed's bungalow, the
      objecting Doorkeeper running along behind. He bangs
      open the front door.

                              JAMAL
                Latika!

150    INT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              150

       Stops dead. The place has been stripped of everything.
       Not a single thing remains. Jamal runs into another
       room. As empty as the first. He stops in his tracks.

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 Told you.

                               JAMAL
                 Where? Where is she?

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 Dunno.

       He grabs the Door-keeper by the shirt-collar, slams him
       up against the wall. Holds the knife against his
       throat.

                               JAMAL
                 Where?

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 I don't know! Wouldn't say,
                 would they? They had to get out
                 fast. The police. Honestly.

       Jamal lets go of the Door-keeper. Goes hopelessly to
       the window. On the window sill is a phone. He picks it
       up. There is a dial tone. Jamal rummages in his trouser
       pocket. Gets out the battered card with Salim's details
       on. Dials. Salim picks up.

                               JAMAL
                 Where are you? Where is she?


150A   INT. JAVED'S SAFE HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. DAY.             150A

       Salim is stalking around his room in Javed's new house.
       Hold-alls of clothes and possessions lie around the
       room. A chest of drawers sits with its drawers open,
       still empty.

                               SALIM
                 Where you'll never find her. Or
                 me. You could have joined us,
                 you bloody idiot, been one of
                 us. You've lost everything now.
                 Everything.

       Cuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer.
       Takes the gun from his waist, and throws that in too.
       Slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can.

                                                          104.

                 Salim...!

       The line goes dead. Jamal slides to the floor...


151    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            151

       ...the camera pulls out from Jamal's face revealing
       that Jamal is sitting on the floor of Salim's
       apartment. In the background can be heard the sound of
       the television. Jamal looks at the knife in his hand,
       wonders what he might do with it. The sound of Prem's
       voice on the tv.

                               PREM O/S
                 ...if you want a chance to play
                 Who Wants to be a Millionaire,
                 call now...!

       Jamal looks up. Stares at the tv.

                 This way, Jamal, this way. Great
                 show, my friend. See you
                 tomorrow, huh?

       In the half-light, Prem guides him to a stage door.


153    EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            153

       Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the
       rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is
       thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into
       the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at
       the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens
       screaming.

                               DIRECTOR
                 What's going on?

                                 PREM
                 He's a cheat.

                               DIRECTOR
                 This was you? You called them?

       Prem shrugs.

                               DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                 How d'you know he's cheating?

                                 PREM
                   Oh, come on! Of course he is.
                   He's a bloody village boy. Even
                   when I fed him the wrong answer
                   the little shit got it right.

      Director stares at him.

                                 DIRECTOR
                   You gave him an answer?

                                 PREM
                   Well, I didn't exactly-

      The Director walks away shaking his head. In the
      doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   Nita?

      But she too turns and walks away.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   It is all bizarrely plausible.
                   And yet...

                   Because I am a slum dog, chi-
                   wallah, I am a liar, right?

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Most of you are.

      Srinivas comes hurrying in carrying a file, very
      pleased with himself.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   Shooting at Pila Street, October
                   19th...Maman Hossani....Victim
                   pronounced dead at scene.
                   Suspects absconded: two males,
                   early teens, one female, early
                   teen.

      The Inspector takes the file. Stares at it. Shakes his
      head.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   But you: you're not a liar,
                   Mister Malik, that is for sure.
                   You are too truthful.

      He turns to Srinivas.

                                  INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                    Thank you, Constable. All that
                    remains is to work out whether
                    it was manslaughter or murder.
                    Ten years, or life.

       The Young Constable sticks his head around the door.

                                  YOUNG CONSTABLE
                    The Commissioner's here, Sir.

       The Inspector sighs. Gets up. Accompanied by Srinivas,
       he leaves the room. Jamal sits there. Lets his head
       drop. The camera floats from the room, down the dingy
       corridor and out through a window...

                    eighteen year-old boy from the
                    slums of Mumbai win one Crore
                    rupees by fair means or foul?
                    And in the crowds all around me
                    there is an even bigger
                    question. Will he be back on the

       The Commissioner is waiting in the outer office.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    So? Have you charged him yet?

       The Commissioner dumps a copy of the Times of India
       down on the desk. Then the Hindustan Times, the Amar
       Ujala and the Afternoon Dispatch thump down after them.
       All have photos of Jamal on Who Wants to be a
       Millionaire on the front page.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    And if that isn't enough for
                    you...

       He motions the Inspector to come over to the window.

       Lifts the blind. The Inspector hurries over. Looks
       alarmed.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    That's-?

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    - yes, yes! The boy's a bloody
                    hero with every beggar and thief
                    in the city. We're in danger of
                    looking very stupid, here,
                    Inspector.

                                  INSPECTOR
                    Whilst I'm not convinced he
                    actually cheated, I have got-

       The Inspector brandishes the file.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    - Prem Kumar himself- a man of
                    great standing and integrity-
                    said the kid was a liar and a
                    cheat. What more do you need?

       The Inspector pauses.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    A liar.

       Then he puts the file behind his back. Srinivas frowns.

                                   INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                    Indeed, sir.

       Srinivas coughs pointedly. Gets a steely look from the
       Inspector. The Commissioner has been staring out of the
       window at the crowds. Turns back to them.

                                  COMMISIONER OF POLICE
                    He's in for fraud, so you charge
                    him for fraud. Fast. Or you'll
                    find yourself on traffic duty at

157    INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.            157

       A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling
       back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on
       the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing
       cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls
       giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring
       drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at
       the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip
       from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is
       staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the
       remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a
       music channel. Latika hurries out.

                               JAVED
                 What about my bloody whisky,
                 woman?

       But she has already gone. He growls after her.

                               JAVED (CONT'D)
                 Hey, Salim.

       He motions Salim to get him a drink. Javed's mobile
       rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a
       bottle to the back.

                               SALIM
                 We're out. I'll just get- Syed.

       Salim smiles faintly at the image of Jamal and hurries
       out.


158    INT . JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. NIGHT.           158

       A drawer opens. Inside is Salim's pistol. And a phone-
       the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares
       at both for a long time. Finally, picks up the gun and
       phone.

                               SALIM
                      (to himself)
                 Final answer?

       He finds this faintly amusing.

159   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                 159

      Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears
      running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front
      of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away
      the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door
      behind him. Stares at the tv.

                              SALIM
                That boy. He will never give up.
                Never.

      He shakes his head.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                Crazy chutiyé.

      Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks
      towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                Ja. Go.

                                 LATIKA
                But-

                              SALIM
                - just drive. There won't be
                another chance. Go.

      Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.

                              LATIKA
                He'll kill you.

      Salim smiles, shakes his head.

                              SALIM
                It is not written.

                                 JAVED O/S
                Salim!

      Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for
      her.

                              LATIKA
                Salim, I....can't.

      Salim points at the television.

                              SALIM
                You have to. It'll take you two
                hours if you drive fast. Here.

      He holds out his mobile phone.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                For God's sake, hold on to it.

      Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her
      head for a moment.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   For what I have done, please
                   forgive me.

      Salim releases her.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Go. Have a good life.

      Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.
      Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

      Jamal is dozing in the chair. He wakes with a shout.
      Srinivas has just thrown a bucket of water in his face.
      He unlocks the handcuffs. Jamal looks up at him.
      Srinivas shrugs.

      Srinivas walks Jamal through the police office, past
      the Inspector sitting at his desk, his arms behind his
      head, pondering. He watches Jamal go and then asks:

                                 INSPECTOR OF POLICE
                   What happened? To the girl?

                   Who knows?

      Jamal walks on. The Inspector watches him all the way.

      Jamal sits in the back of the police jeep. It pulls out
      of the police station car park into a sea of people all
      cheering and shouting at the jeep. Jamal looks
      terrified.

      The jeep stops at the lights and a beggar wanders up,
      tapping on the windscreen. The beggar studies Jamal's
      face for a second, then starts shouting and pointing at
      him.

                              BEGGAR
                Crorepati! Crorepati!

      Other beggars- just like the one Jamal used to be- join
      him and start cheering and applauding. The jeep pulls
      away.

                                    NITA
                   You should be.

      She dumps the powder compact in his hand.

                                 PREM
                   So. Tonight. The Calypso Bar.

                                 NITA
                   Not if you were the only man in
                   the world.

      She walks off.

                                 PREM
                        (genuinely puzzled)
                   But I am the only man in the
                   world.


173   EXT. MUMBAI STREET. NIGHT.                               173

      The traffic is gridlocked. Latika is pumping the horn.

                                 LATIKA
                   Come on, come on!

      She glances out of the window, sees one of the roadside
      shacks with the television on. Gets out of the car and
      runs to it.

                                                           113.

       The Inspector wanders into his office, still deep in
       thought. Switches on the television just as the
       Millionaire music starts. Sits. The phone rings.

       Prem and Jamal walk on-stage. Blinding light. They take
       their seats to tumultuous applause.

                                PREM
                 Welcome back to Who Wants to be
                 a Millionaire? I can safely say
                 that tonight is the biggest
                 night of both of our lives,
                 Ladies and Gentlemen. Jamal
                 Malik, the Call Centre worker
                 from Mumbai has already won one
                 Crore rupees, a cool ten
                 million. Tonight, he can walk
                 away with that in his pocket or
                 make the biggest gamble in
                 television history and go for
                 the final question and a
                 staggering twenty million
                 rupees! Jamal, are you ready for
                 that question?

                               JAMAL
                 Yes.

       The lights dim, the music rumbles. Prem pushes the
       button on his computer. Pauses. Gets conversational.

                               PREM
                 Big reader, are you Jamal? A
                 lover of literature?

       Nervous laughter from the audience. Jamal just shrugs.

                   I can read.

      Even more nervous laughter.

                                 PREM
                   Lucky! In Alexandre Dumas' book,
                   The Three Musketeers, two of the
                   musketeers are called Athos and
                   Porthos. What was the name of
                   the third musketeer. Was it A)
                   Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,
                   C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.

      An involuntary laugh comes out of Jamal's mouth.

      In the shack, sitting on an upturned oil drum,
      surrounded by puzzled Indians in rags, a slow smile
      comes to Latika's face.

                                 PREM
                   The final question, for twenty
                   million rupees: and he's
                   smiling. I guess you know the
                   answer.

                                 JAMAL
                   Would you believe it? I don't.

      Jamal laughs. There's nothing else to do. The audience
      groan.

                                 PREM
                   You don't? So, you're going to
                   take the ten million and walk?

                                 JAMAL
                   No.

                                 PREM
                   No?

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll play.

      A gasp from the audience.

                   You just said you don't know the
                   answer. I heard that, right? You
                   do understand that if you get
                   the answer wrong, you lose
                   everything? Ten million rupees.
                   A fortune, Jamal.

      A terrible pause.

                                 JAMAL
                   I'd like to phone a friend.

      Prem presses his computer. Ominous rumble of drums. The
      lights dim. A phone can be heard ringing, the amplified
      sound echoing around the studio.

                                   PREM
                   It's ringing.

      Latika is staring at the television. Then an electric
      current seems to shoot through her and she is running,
      dodging the static traffic, street vendors, the odd
      cow, heading for her abandoned car. Hooting horns,
      shouting drivers. The phone rings on...

                                 JAMAL
                   It's the only number I know.

      head, mimes cutting his throat.

                Hello?

                 hear the question one more time?
                 And let's be clear about this.
                 Twenty million rupees ride on

      The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs
      around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his
      computer. Stares hard at Jamal.

                   Aramis.....which is...I have to
                   tell you...the correct answer!

      Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal
      to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is
      smiling, but disorientated.

                We have all been present at the
                making of history, Ladies and
                Gentlemen! Jamal Malik,
                millionaire!

                              JAMAL
                Latika? Latika?

      To ever-increasing roars and applause from the
      audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.


191   INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                              191

      The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at
      the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like
      an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic
      on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,
      faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.


192   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                192

      A small tv in the bathroom. Salim smiles.

                              JAVED O/S
                Salim! Teri ma ki chute! Salim!

      Javed is banging on the door. Salim gets up from where
      he has been praying. He climbs into the bath which is
      full of bank notes and lies down amongst the money. He
      reaches across for the pistol and picks it up. Smiles
      slightly as Javed smashes down the door, pulls the
      trigger and shoots Javed. He falls onto the floor,
      dead. But the Thug right behind him shoots Salim in the
      chest. He lies back in the bath, the faintest trace of
      a smile on his face as he stares at the pictures of
      Jamal on the tv.

                               SALIM
                God is good.

      Salim dies.


193   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           193

      Prem and Jamal are being posed by photographers. A
      giant-sized cheque for twenty million rupees is
      manhandled onto the floor by the Floor Manager and an
      Assistant amidst much cheering and laughter. Jamal is
      snapped next to a scowling Prem. The Inspector appears
      next to them.

                              INSPECTOR
                Just one more thing left, Sir.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               120.
193   CONTINUED:                                                   193

      Prem smiles.

                                   PREM
                   Finally, huh?

                                 INSPECTOR
                   If you'd like to come with me.

      He takes Jamal by the arm, leads him backstage.



194   INT/EXT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                 194

      Jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the
      Inspector as he drives through the traffic. Then:

                                 JAMAL
                   Truth alone triumphs? I should
                   have known better.

      The Inspector stops the jeep. Unlocks the handcuffs.
      Holds the back door open for Jamal.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Thought you might need a lift,
                   Sir.

      He nods towards the outside world. Dazed, Jamal gets
      out.


195   EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    195

      Jamal finds himself    gazing up     at VT station. Slowly, he
      wanders inside. The    Inspector     takes the contents of the
      file and tears them    slowly in     half. Lets the pieces
      fall on the ground.    Gets back     in the jeep and drives
      away.


196   OMITTED                                                      196


197   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    197

      VT station is awash with the evening commute. Thousands
      of people crowd the platforms, jostling the only still
      figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of
      Frederick Stevens. Jamal. Then there is a gap in the
      wall of bodies that swirls around him. Jamal gets to
      his feet.

                                   JAMAL
                   Latika?

      Then she is gone in the melee again. Only to reappear.


                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                        121.
197   CONTINUED:                                            197

                                 LATIKA
                   Jamal?

      Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will
      stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they
      are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold
      each other's hands tight. The whole station seems
      frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being
      Jamal and Latika.

                                  LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   I thought we would meet again
                   only in death.

      He shakes his head.

                                 JAMAL
                   I knew you'd be watching.

      Jamal puts his hand on Latika's chin, turns her head
      gently so that she is facing him. He sees the knife
      scars on her cheek for the first time. She tries to
      turn her head, but he won't let her. Runs his hand
      slowly down the scar. Rests his hand there.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   This is our destiny.

      He gently kisses the scarred cheek.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   This is our destiny.

      The camera pulls back and back, rising above the
      station. The music starts and the frozen station comes
      alive, two thousand kurta-clad men and saree-clad women
      dancing in and out and on top of the trains, an unbound
      celebration of hope and humanity that has at its
      centre, Jamal and Latika.



                                                      THE END
SMASHED

    CLINKING GLASSES and other assorted BAR SOUNDS.

                        KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
              Let's give a hand to Rodney!

    Scattered APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER.

                        KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
              Next up, we've got a little lady
              named...KATE!

    Joyful APPLAUSE.

              Yeah, Kate!


    THE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A "KARAOKE SONG TO BE
    DETERMINED"

                                                      FADE IN:


1   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                     1

    CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     *
    oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny

    KARAOKE STAGE

    in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.

    Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
    version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent
    she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.

    At a table near the stage is --

    -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      *
    handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps
    and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --

    -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       *
    who sings along with --

    -- the small but energetic CROWD.

    Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
    to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the
    Queen of Karaoke.

    LATER
                                                         2.


Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
join Charlie and Owen.

                    CHARLIE
          That was so good, baby!

                       KATE
          Bullshit.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm serious. You sing like an angel
          -- a drunk angel.

Owen and Kate LAUGH.

                    KATE
          If you were writing about my
          performance for your blog, what
          would you say?

                    CHARLIE
          I'd say that, uh...my wife is the
          sexiest, most amazing woman alive.

                    KATE
          That would be such a shitty article
          -- nobody would read it.

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
Owen and makes a puppy dog face.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (to Owen)
          Aw...we need to find you a lady,
          Owen.

                    OWEN
          Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt
          with the bartender, but...I can't
          tell.

Owen motions to the --

-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.                                *

                    KATE
          She's hot! What can't you tell?

                    OWEN
          She looks like she could kick my
          ass. No way would she go for a guy
          like me.
                                                         3.


                    KATE
          You're being a little girl -- just
          go talk to her.

                    OWEN
              (clearly shy)
          I don't know...forget about it.

                    KATE
              (not going to take "no"
               for an answer)
          I'll take point -- follow me.

Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          I want to buy a gimlet for me and a
          double-shot of whiskey for my
          brother-in-law `cause he's had a
          hard week.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
          `Kay.

The bartender quickly pours the drinks.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          That's fifteen.

                    KATE
          Wait -- don't you wanna know what
          happened to him?

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she
listens.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
              (unenthused)
          What happened?

                    KATE
          He just got back from England --
          because he went there for a girl! A
          preppy, bitchy girl. Diane
          Court...that was her name. He loved
          her so much that he went with her
          because she had a fellowship or
          something. He gave up being a
          kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *
              (sad)
          And she dumped him.
                                                         4.


The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation
to hear her response, which is --

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
              (to Owen)
          You kickbox?

                    OWEN
              (caught in the headlights)
          Yeah.

And...that's all Owen's got.

                    KATE
              (jumping in)
          And he teaches kids at the
          kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
          cute!

The bartender glances back to Owen.

                     OWEN
              (finally)
          A lot of `em don't have parents --
          so...it's kinda more than just a
          teacher/student thing.
              (beat)
          I know it sounds silly, but I feel
          responsible for them -- like...
              (emotional)
          ...I could be their parent.

Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.

                    KATE
              (hushed)
          I think I got him laid.

                       CHARLIE
          Yeah?

                    KATE
          She seems totally game.

                    CHARLIE
          Sure she just didn't want to get
          into your pants?

Kate rolls her eyes.

                    KATE
          I think I'm done for the night.
                                                5.


                    CHARLIE
          Yeah?

Owen wanders over, dejected.                         *

                    OWEN
          She's seen "Say Anything."

                      CHARLIE
          Eh, well...what're you gonna do,
          huh?
               (beat)
          Wanna drive us home?

                    KATE
          No -- he needs to keep working it!         *
          You guys stay here.

                     CHARLIE
          I don't want to watch my brother
          not score. I want to go to bed with
          you and...
              (whispered into Kate's
               ear)
          ...you know.

                    KATE
          I'll be home when you get there. We
          can "you know" then.

                    OWEN
              (to Charlie)
          Yeah, man -- you don't have a job
          to wake up for in the morning or
          anything.

                    CHARLIE
          Writing is a job! Not having to
          report to an office only makes work
          harder.
              (to Kate)
          Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen
          should take us home -- you're too
          drunk to drive.

                     KATE
          So's Owen.
              (suddenly focused)
          I'm not that drunk. Besides, you
          know I focus when I drive -- it
          sobers me up.

                    CHARLIE
          Tell that to the cops.
                                                             6.


    Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.

                        KATE
                  (to Charlie)
              I love you, baby. I'll be waiting
              for you in a nice warm bed. You
              have exactly one mission: get your
              brother laid -- and don't talk to
              any other women.

    Beat.

                        CHARLIE
              That sounds like two missions.

                        KATE
              No, it's just one.

                        CHARLIE
                  (to Owen)
              It kinda sounded like two, right?

                        OWEN
                  (nodding)
              It did.

    Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.

                        KATE
                  (really fast)
              GoodbyeIloveyouboth!


2   EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                        2   *

    Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
    over and sees:

    A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS
    again.

    Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and
    Freda.

                          KATE
              You okay?

                        FREDA
                  (quick)
              Yeah. Are you?

                         KATE
                  (taken aback)
              Um...sure.
                                                             7.


                        FREDA
              Good.
                  (whispers)
              Hey, I'm not really okay.

                        KATE
              Oh...

                        FREDA
              My bitch sister just took off and
              left me here so she could hook up
              with some asshole. Now what am I
              supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a
              car here.

                        KATE
              I guess I could...

                         FREDA
              You'll give me a ride? Oh my god!
              Thank you!

    Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.                   *

                        KATE
              I was gonna say "call you a cab,"
              `cause, you know -- I don't even
              know you.

                         FREDA
              It's not far. Please? Pretty
              please...?

    Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.

                                                      CUT TO:


3   INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT                             3   *

    The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.             *

    Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances
    down at the floor and notices a FLASK.                            *

                        FREDA
              You know, you shouldn't drink and
              drive.

                        KATE
              I wasn't --

                        FREDA
              Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
                                                            8.


Kate's speechless.

                    FREDA (CONT'D)
          I'm really thirsty.

                    KATE
          It's, uh...whiskey.

                    FREDA
          Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love
          whiskey. You're the real thing,
          huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like
          me!

Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.

                    KATE
          I don't know. No.

                    FREDA
          Can I smoke in your car?

                    KATE
              (slightly annoyed)
          Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you
          just roll down the window?

                    FREDA
          Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.

Freda takes out a --

-- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.

                    KATE
              (in disbelief)
          WHOA!

Kate immediately pulls the car over.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Not what I thought you meant.

                    FREDA
          Want a hit?

                    KATE
          No, I...is that pot?

                    FREDA
              (as though it's a
               ridiculous question)
          Of course not! What do I look like?
          A stoner?
                    (MORE)
                                                            9.

                     FREDA (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          It's crack.

                    KATE
          Oh, shit! No...no thank you.

                    FREDA
          C'mon -- it's good crack.

                    KATE
          I don't, um...I've never smoked
          crack.

                    FREDA
              (surprised)
          Really? This stuff is the truth --
          and it'll sober you up.

                    KATE
          Uh...I think you should go.

                    FREDA
          I'm not getting out in the middle
          of nowhere. Do you know what could
          happen to me all alone out here at                     *
          night?

                     KATE
          I don't know -- people might offer
          you crack?

                    FREDA
          Seriously? It's not a big deal --
          just take a little hit.

Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.

                       KATE
          I said no.

                    FREDA
          One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober
          you up.

Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of
her.

                    FREDA (CONT'D)
              (high-pitched cartoon
               voice)
          Smoke me!

Kate LAUGHS.
                                                               10.


                        KATE
              One puff. Then we are both going
              home.

    Freda nods. Long beat.

                        KATE (CONT'D)
              Fine.

    Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate
    sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.

                        FREDA
              You've got money, right?


4   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - NIGHT                                   4

    Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --

    -- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass
    around TWO PIPES.

    LATER

    Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.

    Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're
    still smoking crack.

                        KATE
                  (mile-a-minute fast)
              ...'cause I feel like I understand
              what it's like to be homeless, ya
              know? I mean, if you didn't know
              me, if we hadn't connected tonight,
              you might think: "There's some
              upper-middle-class, NPR listening,
              self-congratulatory, insulated,
              lazy liberal bitch. Probably never
              had to worry about anything." But
              that's not true at all! I grew up
              poor, man. Single mother.
              McDonald's used to have one day a
              week where they sold 29 cent
              hamburgers, and another day where
              they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
              mom and me would go there and she'd
              get twenty burgers -- that was the
              limit, probably set up for folks
              just like us -- and then she'd put
              `em in the freezer and we'd
              microwave `em for dinner throughout
              the week.

                                                             11.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               I was kinda overweight until high
               school, to be perfectly honest.
               Eating used to be my thing. When I
               started drinking, though, I kinda
               stopped eating so much.
                   (back on track)
               But anyway, the point is: You and
               me, we're not so different.

     The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're
     more concerned with their crack pipe.


5    EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN                               5

     Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's
     eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused,
     then jumps to her feet.


6    EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                                6

     Kate runs through the streets.


6A   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                               6A   *

     We TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various               *
     buildings.                                                        *


6B   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - DAWN                                6B   *

     We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS      *
     towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --                  *

     -- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards      *
     the camera.                                                       *

     A LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING:

7    INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN                              7

     Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her
     hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down
     at --

     -- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls.
                                                            12.


    She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland     *
    Park.                                                             *


8   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MORNING                         8

    Kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house.


9   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY/KITCHEN - 9     *
    MORNING

    Kate walks into the kitchen to find --

    -- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to
    his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table.

    Kate tip-toes across the kitchen.

    Charlie quickly jerks up.

                        CHARLIE
                  (confused)
              Huh?!

                        KATE
              Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to
              sleep.

                        CHARLIE
              What happened? I came home and you
              were gone and I waited and waited.

                        KATE
              It's a long story.

                        CHARLIE
              I was worried. I kept calling you.

                        KATE
              I ended up...

    Charlie SNIFFS Kate.

                        CHARLIE
              You smell funny. What do you smell
              like?

                        KATE
              I fell asleep in my car. Near the
              bar. I was too drunk to drive.
                                                             13.


                         CHARLIE
               So, why didn't you come back or
               call me?

                          KATE
               Charlie --
                    (beat)
               -- I'm fine.

                         CHARLIE
               Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby.
               I love you -- and you know how you
               get sometimes.

                         KATE
               I love you too. But I'm home. It's
               over. I gotta get to work.

                         CHARLIE
               I can't be worried about you all
               the time.

     Kate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead.

                          KATE
               Don't worry so much. I'm fine.
                   (beat)
               C'mon -- let me get you to bed.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm up now -- how `bout I make us
               bacon and egg sandwiches?

     Kate smiles.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (knows he's got her)
               Magic words.


10   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING          10

     Kate takes a shower -- while she drinks a BEER.                *

     Gets dressed.

     Puts on make-up.


11   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING           11

     Kate walks into the kitchen, ready to go. Charlie is at the
     stove, cooking bacon and eggs. He hands Kate a MUG OF COFFEE
     and gestures to the table -- where there's a CHECK.
                                                              14.


                         CHARLIE
               Check for your mom's on the table.

                         KATE
               Thanks, baby.

     Kate takes a sip of coffee.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Why does the coffee taste so much
               better when you make it?

                         CHARLIE
               Because I make it with love -- and
               bacon.

     Kate LAUGHS and kisses Charlie.


12   INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                              12   *

     Kate takes a right on a STREET and then pulls into the            *

     PARKING LOT AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

     She's about to get out, but then notices...

     ...the FLASK on the floor.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate chugs what's left in the flask.

     ACROSS THE PARKING LOT                                            *

     MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40's, slightly       *
     nerdy but not bad looking, watches --                             *

     -- Kate drink in her car.                                         *

     CHILDREN pass by in the distance.                                 *

     Mr. Davies takes a beat, but instead of saying anything he        *
     walks away through the parking lot.                               *

     Kate doesn't notice she's been seen.                              *

14   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  14

     Kate stands next to a CHALKBOARD in front of a class of THIRD
     GRADERS. She's really animated -- doing her "game show
     hostess" schtick.

     On the chalkboard are the letters: "AN"

                         KATE
                   (to the class)
               Now, if I add a "C," what word do I
               have?

     A STUDENT raises her hand.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Yes, Hillary?                                         *

               Can?

                         KATE
               That's correct! Can. You've won an
               all-expenses paid trip to the
               blackboard, Hillary!                                  *

     Hillary hesitates. She looks embarrassed.                       *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               C'mon...there's a washer-dryer
               combo in it for you.

     Hillary shuffles up to the board and writes "CAN."              *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      *
               her a round of applause!

     The class APPLAUDS.

     Hillary smiles and goes back to her seat.                       *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Can anyone use "can" in a sentence?

     A student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand.

                           KATE (CONT'D)
               Yes?

                         ANGELA
               "Hurry up in there -- I gotta use
               the can!"
                                                        16.


The students GIGGLE.

                    KATE
              (quickly moving on)
          Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro
          with flames painted on the hood.

The students CHEER.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Now --
              (to the class)
          -- what's another word I could make
          by adding a letter to "an"?

Nobody raises their hand.

                       KATE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...

Finally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Yes -- Ramon?

                       RAMON
          P.

                    KATE
          P...okay, what word would that make
          if I added a "P"?

                       RAMON
          Um...pan?

                    KATE
          Pan! That's right. Ramon
          Martinez...COME ON DOWN!

Ramon walks up and begins to write "PAN."

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Wow! Just look at that excellent
          penman --

Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She
quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely --

-- VOMITS on the floor!

Ramon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks
horrified.

Kate glances up from behind her desk to see --
                                                                17.


     -- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like --

                         KIDS
               EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS
               LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA!
               SHRIMP! BACON!

     Embarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and
     begins cleaning up the mess.

                         KATE
                   (to the class)
               I'm so sorry you had to see that.

     HILLARY stands up.                                                *

                         HILLARY                                       *
               Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?

                          KATE
               What?

                         HILLARY                                       *
               My mommy threw up when she was
               pregnant with my little sister. Are
               you pregnant?

     Some of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like "Ooh!"
     "She's gonna have a baby.").

                          RAMON
               Are you?

     Kate seems flustered and says --

                          KATE
               Yes.


15   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            15

     Kate sits across a desk from --

     -- PRINCIPAL BARNES: female, early 50's, stern, scattered,        *
     and clearly a softy at heart, she wears a pair of GLASSES         *
     around her neck.                                                  *

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               Vice Principal Davies will be
               looking after your students for the
               rest of the day -- so you don't
               need to worry about that.
                                                        18.


                     KATE
          Oh, that's really good to know.
          I'll have to thank him.
              (beat)
          I just feel awful for getting sick
          in front of my students.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm
          sure they've seen plenty worse.
              (beat)
          So -- how long have you been
          pregnant?

                    KATE
          Um...it's the first trimester.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Well, it's very exciting. You must
          be thrilled.

                       KATE
              (nods)
          Uh-huh.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Can I ask a...personal question?

                       KATE
          Okay.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          How's it...
              (beat)
          ...going for you?

                       KATE
          Huh?

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          The pregnancy, I mean.

Kate's not sure how to respond.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          Having kids wasn't in the cards for
          me. I came close, but...

Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then
catches herself and quickly shifts gears.
                                                        19.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          ...I mean, it's like I've got a
          couple hundred kids here --
              (forces a laugh)
          -- but...I don't fool myself. It's
          not the same.

                    KATE
              (considers her reply)
          Well...it's hard to explain.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Of course...

                    KATE
          I wouldn't call it a burden, but --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          It's a responsibility.

Beat.

                    KATE
          Yeah. Exactly.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (nods)
          You're so lucky.
              (beat)
          Can I...touch it?

                    KATE
          Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps
          a lot.

                       PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Of course.

                    KATE
          Like...a lot.

Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate. She places
her hand on Kate's belly and closes her eyes.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (whispers)
          Hello in there. Can you hear me?
          You're a tiny miracle. Did you know
          that? A miracle.

Principal Barnes looks up at Kate and smiles -- with tears in
her eyes.
                                                                20.


16   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                       16

     Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her
     classroom. Through the glass she sees --

     -- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned
     smile you give someone right after they've publicly
     embarrassed themselves).

     Kate mouths the words --

                          KATE
                   (silent)
               Thank you.

     -- and gestures "come here."

     Mr. Davies gestures   to the class that he'll be right back --
     before he walks out   to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly
     nervous demeanor --   somewhere between "I never became
     comfortable talking   to women" and Asperger's.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Is everything, um...okay, Mrs.
               Hannah?

                         KATE
               Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed
               -- but I feel a lot better. And I
               just wanted to say thank you.

     Mr. Davies glances down the hall.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Look -- I'm not a fool.
                   (whispered)
               I know you were drinking this
               morning.

     Kate looks shocked.

                            MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               I saw you.

                         KATE
                   (taken aback)
               Oh, no, I...

                         MR. DAVIES
               Drinking when you're pregnant is
               really dangerous.
                                                             21.


                         KATE
               I know that! Oh, God, I...
                   (long beat)
               ...listen -- I'm not actually
               pregnant.

                         MR. DAVIES
               What?

                         KATE
               I'm just really hung over. The kids
               started asking me questions after I
               vomited and I panicked.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Oh. That's...not good.

                         KATE
               I know. I...please don't say
               anything.

     Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Just...go home. Get some sleep.

     Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the
     classroom.


17   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                      17

     Kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it
     and --

     -- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch.


18   INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY                                  18   *

     Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER.
     It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?

                         KATE
               I had such a crappy morning.

                         CHARLIE
               Me too. I spent like three hours at
               the post office trying to buy
               stamps and stuff.

     Kate takes a long sip of beer.
                                                        22.


                    KATE
          I told my class I was pregnant.

Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over
and grabs her hand.

                    CHARLIE
              (excited and sort of
               confused)
          Oh, baby, that's --

                    KATE
          I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.

                      CHARLIE
                (deflated)
          Oh.
              (beat)
          `Cause it would be great news -- if
          it was true.
              (beat)
          `Course then I'd have to drink your
          beer...

                    KATE
          Well, it was a lie. I just lied to
          my class. After barfing in front of
          them.

                    CHARLIE
              (cringes)
          Ooh...

                    KATE
          Yeah, that's what they said.
              (long beat)
          Listen...I can't do this anymore.

A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's
face.

                    CHARLIE
          What do you mean?

                    KATE
          I dunno. I think I might...drink
          too much.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                    CHARLIE
          Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.

Charlie swigs his beer.
                                      23.


          KATE
I know I do -- I'm a fucking
mess...

          CHARLIE
Baby -- that's not true. You're
beautiful. And brilliant. And I
love you. I wouldn't be married to
a "mess."

          KATE
I left work after puking in front           *
of little kids. And...now I'm               *
drinking in the middle of the day.          *

           CHARLIE
Well, those things happen
sometimes.
    (beat)
I mean, they shouldn't happen all
the time, but...it's the price of,
uh, truly living life.

          KATE
Isn't that like a slogan for some
kind of beer or toothpaste or
something...?

           CHARLIE
No. And it's true -- you and me,
we're not just some boring couple
in the suburbs who don't sleep with
each other and have nothing to talk
about except whatever TV show
they're currently into.
    (beat)
We, like...still know how to party.

           KATE
Yeah...
    (beat)
...I think I need to slow down.
    (beat)
And I might need help.

          CHARLIE
I'll help you.

          KATE
I know, but...I might need more
help.

          CHARLIE
Yeah? Like a therapist?
                                                24.


                    KATE
          I don't know -- I just get stupid
          when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a
          lot.

                    CHARLIE
          We just like to have a good time.

                     KATE
          Yeah, well...
              (beat)
          ...you've gotta promise not to tell
          this to anyone.

                     CHARLIE
              (curious)
          I promise.

                    KATE
          That includes Owen.

                       CHARLIE
          Of course.

                    KATE
          Well, last night I kinda, um...
              (hushed)
          ...smoked some crack.

                       CHARLIE
          WHAT?!

Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.

                    KATE
          After I left the bar, I, uh, picked
          up this drunk girl and...I don't
          really remember what came next, but
          I ended up smoking crack with her.

                     CHARLIE
              (confused)
          Uh...how's that even happen?
              (beat)
          You give someone a ride and she
          rewards you with crack?!

                    KATE
          Well...she seemed desperate. She
          really needed a ride home.

                       CHARLIE
          Where?
                                                        25.


                    KATE
          Downtown. I think she maybe lives
          in...a tent?

                    CHARLIE
          What?

                    KATE
          Well...she might be homeless. Or a
          prostitute. Or just some lost
          sorority girl.
              (thinks about it)
          To be honest, I'm not sure...

                    CHARLIE
              (disgusted)
          Oh, my god...you smoked crack with
          some random stranger? Did
          you...share a pipe?

Kate doesn't answer. She doesn't need to.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Ughhh...
              (beat)
          Just playing Devil's advocate, but
          maybe it's the crack-smoking you
          need help with and not the
          drinking.

Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I'm just saying.

                     KATE
          The drinking led to the crack-
          smoking. The drinking leads to
          everything stupid I do.
              (beat)
          I mean...can you even remember the
          last time we had sober sex?

Charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to
remember. And can't.

                     CHARLIE
          We'll chill out with the booze for
          a while. We can just be wine-with-                   *
          dinner people.
              (beat)
          How's that sound?
                                                             26.


19   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            19

     Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.

                         CHARLIE
               Maybe you should go to, uh... one
               of those meetings. They have `em
               over there.

     Charlie gestures to a

     BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building
     where AA meets).

     Kate LAUGHS.

                         KATE
               Yeah, right.

                         CHARLIE
               Remember when I was shit-faced and
               took that Q & A pamphlet from
               there?

                         KATE
                   (laughs)
               Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to
               like every question and at the end
               it was like, "If you answered `yes'
               to any of these you're an
               alcoholic!"

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah...
                   (nostalgic)
               ...that was fun, wasn't it?

     Kate smiles and nods.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Hey --

     Charlie gestures to the street.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               -- look out for that crack!

     Kate looks down but sees nothing.

                         KATE
               What crack?
                                                             27.


                         CHARLIE
               Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a
               crack there...
                   (grins)
               ...but you must have smoked it last
               night.

     Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
     Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
     Kate chases after him.


20   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER           20

     While an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which
     is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --

     -- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        *
     LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.

                         CHARLIE
               "Have you missed days of work or
               school because of drinking?"

                         KATE
               Absolutely.

                         CHARLIE
               "Do you envy people who can drink
               without getting into trouble?"

                         KATE
               Envy isn't exactly the right
               word...

                         CHARLIE
               "Do you have `blackouts'?"

                         KATE
               Yeah, but who doesn't?

                         CHARLIE
               "Has your drinking caused trouble
               at home?"

                         KATE
               No! We're great.

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah. Definitely. But we still had
               a lot of "yes" answers.
                   (refers to pamphlet)
               Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
                                                              28.


                         KATE
               I'm gonna go!

                         CHARLIE
                   (disbelief)
               Yeah, right.

                         KATE
               No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go.
               What time is it?

                         CHARLIE
               Eight.

     Kate gets up.

                         KATE
               See ya.

                         CHARLIE
                   (doesn't believe her)
               Uh-huh...

     Kate takes a big sip of wine.

                         KATE
                   (quite serious)
               This is me: going.

     Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.

                         CHARLIE
               You've been boozing.

                         KATE
               So? You should come too!

     Charlie LAUGHS.

                          CHARLIE
               Yeah, right. You can't go to AA
               wasted. It's like a rule or
               something.

                         KATE
               Oh, yeah? Watch me!


21   INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT                                  21

     An AA meeting is in progress.

     An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.
                                                        29.


The room is filled with --

-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their
"own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people
are adults. There are distinct groups of --

-- "PRETTY WOMEN" --

-- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" --

-- "BUSINESSMEN" --

-- and "HIPSTERS."

As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a
hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his
hand.

                    DONOVAN
              (whispers)
          Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.

                    KATE
          Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!

Donovan "shushes" Kate.

                    DONOVAN
          You must be a newcomer, huh?

                       KATE
          A what?

                    DONOVAN
              (whispers)
          Um, I'm not really allowed to talk
          to new chicks, but there are lots
          of women here who can help you out.

                     KATE
              (confused)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Do I just sit wherever?

                    DONOVAN
          The meeting already started so just
          try to find a spot anywhere.

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying
things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.
                                                        30.


As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
to Kate quietly try to welcome her.

                    LILY                                        *
          Are you new?

                    KATE
          To this? Yeah. Why's everyone
          whispering?

                    SHANA                                       *
          It's hard, huh?

                     KATE
          I guess.

                    LILY                                        *
          Everything's going to be fine.
          You're home.

Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
joined Jim Jones' church.

LATER

The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.

The tattooed man stands at the podium.

                    TATTOO MAN
          Not to embarrass anyone, but so
          that we may get to know you better -
          - is there anybody here in their
          first thirty days of recovery?

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
introduce themselves as alcoholics.

Kate stands up.

                    KATE
          I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a
          little drunk right now.

People burst into LAUGHTER.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Do you want me to talk about my
          childhood or something?
                                                        31.


                    TATTOO MAN
              (painfully polite)
          You know, Kate, we actually ask
          that you don't share if you've had                  *
          a drink or any mind-altering
          substance in the past 24 hours.

                    KATE
              (not listening)
          I can -- I kinda hate my dad and
          don't talk to him. And my mom...oh,
          man...I don't even know where to
          start. She's, like, stuck in the
          80's and kind of a metalhead. Her
          last boyfriend called himself a
          drummer but really just gave drum
          lessons to little kids and --

                    TATTOO MAN
              (tries to shut Kate up)
          Welcome, Kate.
              (forces a smile)
          It gets better.

                    KATE
              (not picking up the hint)
          I like drinking is the thing. I
          mean, I don't want to say you guys
          are wrong or anything...

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.

                    TATTOO MAN
          Thank you -- we're all here to
          help. We do have to move on,
          though.

The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.

                    LILY                                      *
          Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be
          plenty of time to tell your story.

A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.

                    AMBER
          Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't
          really believe that it's been five
          years. I mean, my life was a mess
          back then. Now I'm back in school,
          I have an amazing man, I love my
          parents -- it's crazy...
                                                        32.


                    KATE
              (way too loud)
          How old is that girl?! Can she even
          go to bars?
              (to Amber)
          How old are you, Amber?

                    SHANA                                      *
          Be respectful.

Kate seems surprised at being chastised.

                    AMBER
              (gaining intensity)
          Um...okay? It's because I did the
          work. I got down on my knees and
          prayed every night! I went to a
          meeting everyday!

                      KATE
          Everyday?

                    AMBER
          It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say,
          I owe everything to AA. Well, AA --
          and God, of course!

The whole room APPLAUDS.

LATER

Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY
PRAYER.

                    EVERYONE
          God grant me the serenity to accept
          the things I cannot change --
          courage to change the things I can -
          - and wisdom to know the
          difference.

                      KATE
          AMEN!

Everyone turns and looks at Kate.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (embarrassed)
          Okay...I think I'm good.

Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.
                                                             33.


22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22

     Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.

                         KATE
               So much for that.

     Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
     crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN
     FURNITURE.

     They drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      *

                         CHARLIE
               Was it a bunch of old biker guys?

                         KATE
               No, it was...I don't know.
               Enthusiastic people. A lot of
               really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!

                         CHARLIE
               Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm
               sorry it wasn't cool.

     Charlie thinks for a moment.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I can't really imagine never
               drinking. I guess I don't have to,
               though --
                   (beat)
               -- you're the one with the problem.

     Kate nods in agreement.                                           *

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Hey -- I love you. I don't want you
               to have to drink.

                          KATE
               I don't have to drink.
                   (beat)
               I just really like to drink.                            *

                         CHARLIE
                   (sincere)
               Good -- `cause you're my favorite
               person to drink with in the whole
               damn world.

     Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment,
     and then Kate...
                                                             34.


     ...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate
     grins mischievously.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Oh, no you didn't!

     Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie
     dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in
     the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too
     intense.


23   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                23

     Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to
     unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's
     extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and
     voice).

                         CHARLIE
               Are you trying to have some sex?

     Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She
     climbs on top of him and --

     -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.

     After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving.
     She looks down to discover that --

     -- he's passed out.

     Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her
     unconscious husband.


24   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                24

     Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she
     drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more
     booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a
     couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there
     isn't more alcohol in the house.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --


25   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                          25

     Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
     robe and slippers).
                                                                35.


26   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT                               26

     Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is
     kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO
     BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.

     Kate sets the bottles on the counter.                             *

     The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate
     with pity.

                         CLERK
               You know I can't sell you this,
               Kate.

     An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at
     Kate.                                                             *

                         KATE
               What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come
               on -- I'm in here all the time. You
               know me.

                         CLERK
               Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're
               old enough -- but it's too late.

     The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).

                         KATE
               C'mon -- we can just pretend it's
               before two...

     Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.

                         CLERK
                   (not amused)
               Stop it.

                         KATE
               It's just a little wine. I'm not
               driving or anything.

                         CLERK
               I don't think so. Sorry.

     Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.

                         KATE
               Come on, dude -- I'll let you have
               a sip if you want.

     Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance.
                                                        36.


                    CLERK
          It's the law. I can't sell alcohol
          after 2 a.m. You know that.

                    KATE
          Why don't you give it to me, then?
          That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift
          -- because we're friends.

                    CLERK
          I could lose my job.

Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at
the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.                   *

                    KATE
              (to the elderly man; meant
               to be a whisper, but way
               too loud)
          You distract him, okay?!

The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of
it.

                    CLERK
          Look -- why don't you get a bottle
          of water or a coffee or something
          instead?

                    KATE
          Water or coffee? Fuck you. What --
          just cause I won't suck your dick?

                    CLERK
              (had enough)
          Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you
          gotta go.

Kate doesn't budge.

                    CLERK (CONT'D)
          Seriously, Kate. You should go.

                    KATE
          Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with
tears.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          This is bullshit!
              (beat)
          I have to pee.
                                                             37.


     Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
     - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down
     and begins to pull up her robe.

                         CLERK
               What the fuck are you doing?!

                         KATE
                   (caught)
               I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just
               have to pee really, really bad.                         *

                         CLERK
                   (frustrated)
               Get outta here NOW!

                         KATE
                   (pleads)
               C'mon...can't we drink together?

     The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned,
     and then...

     ...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.


27   EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN                                       27

     Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
     River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her.

     Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.

     A bird SQUAWKS.

     Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state
     she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.


28   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING              28

     Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the
     sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and
     realizes that --

     -- it's 7:30.

     She jumps out of bed in a panic.

                          KATE
               Charlie!

     Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down
     at the bed, which is --
                                                        38.


-- COMPLETELY SOAKED.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
              (mumbled)
          Not again.

Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of
the bed.

                    CHARLIE
          Come back to bed, baby.

                    KATE
          I have to go to work. You snoozed
          my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, you peed on me so I guess                     *
          we're even.                                         *

                    KATE
          I have a weak bladder.

                    CHARLIE
          Well...I can't go to work like
          this.

                    KATE
          You work from our kitchen.

                     CHARLIE
          Yeah, but changing the sheets is my
          real job.
              (beat)
          Hey -- where were you last night?

                    KATE
          Huh?

                     CHARLIE
          I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you
          were gone.

                    KATE
          Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone?
          You must've been dreaming.

Kate then glances down and notices --

-- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS.

She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.
                                                             39.


29   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - STALL - DAY           29

     Kate's on her knees, puking into a toilet.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate exits the stall to find --

     -- Principal Barnes standing by the door.

                           KATE
               I...

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               I can only imagine the chemistry
               experiment that's going on --

     Barnes points at Kate's stomach.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
                   (smiles)
               -- in there.


30   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  30

     Kate sits on a SMALL CHAIR reading a CHILDREN'S BOOK to her
     class --

     -- who're sitting Indian style in a semi-circle.

                         RAMON
               Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?

                         KATE
               I don't know yet.

                         HILLARY                                    *
               When will you know?

                         KATE
               Not until summertime. You guys will
               be on vacation.

                         RAMON
               If you have a boy what will you
               name him?

                         KATE
               Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?

                         ANGELA
               That's a name for a man -- not a
               baby!
                                                          40.


     The children LAUGH.

     Kate LAUGHS too -- but looks a little freaked out.


31   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        31

     Kate eats her PACKED LUNCH with Mr. Davies.

                         KATE
               Thanks again for covering for me.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I can't promise to cover for you
               every time you get pregnant.

                         KATE
               There won't be another time.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I genuinely hope not. Look -- I
               didn't tell Barnes, but if anything
               like this happens again I'll have
               to.

     Mr. Davies smiles -- a sweet, genuine smile.

                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               Okay...Kate?

                         KATE
                   (nodding)
               Okay...
                   (not sure what to say)
               ...David?

     Beat.

                           MR. DAVIES
               Dave.

     Kate tries to hold back a smile.

                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               I know -- Dave Davies...yup...hah-
               hah. Anyway, uh, is everything okay
               with you?

                          KATE
               I don't know.
                   (beat)
               Um...no?
                          (MORE)
                                                           41.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I puked in front of my class and
          then told everyone I'm pregnant.
          That's not really okay, huh?

                    MR. DAVIES
          No, I don't think so.

                    KATE
          I went to AA last night.

                    MR. DAVIES
              (slightly uncomfortable)
          Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it?

                    KATE
          It was awful. I kept getting
          shushed.

                    MR. DAVIES
          I don't normally tell people I work
          with this... but --

Mr. Davies takes a COIN that says "Nine Years" out of his
pocket and shows it to Kate.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          -- I'm a bit of an expert when it
          comes to these things.

                       KATE
                 (shocked)
          You?

                     MR. DAVIES
          Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    *
          I'm nine years sober, AA and NA.
              (beat)
          I used to drink cocaine.
              (off Kate's shocked
               expression)
          It's really cheap in the
          Philippines.

Mr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying.

                     MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          Listen, Kate. I know meetings can
          be weird. Especially at first, but
          if you want to...you never need to
          feel like you have to...but the
          ones I go to are pretty small. Nice
          little groups.
              (beat)
          I'd be happy to take you.
                                                        42.


                    KATE
          Maybe that would be good...I don't
          know.

                    MR. DAVIES
          No pressure, okay. That shit saved
          my life, though.

Principal Barnes walks in.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
              (switching gears)
          Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms.
          Carol's art class. They're making
          macaroni art, so...I'm pretty
          stoked.

Mr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as
he exits.

Principal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled
expression on her face.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (to Kate)
          Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something
          for you...

Principal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug
of ORANGE JUICE.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          Folic Acid! You need it now like
          never before.

                       KATE
              (beat)
          Thanks.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I bet your mother is over the moon,
          huh? Probably planning you a baby
          shower...?

                    KATE
          Oh, well...she and I aren't that
          close.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any
          motherly thing you need -- I'm                       *
          here, okay?

Barnes hands Kate a large glass of juice.
                                                             43.


                         PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
               Now drink up -- that baby in
               there's thirsty!

                          KATE
               Okay.
                   (takes a sip of orange
                     juice)
               And...you're kinda the only person
               at school -- besides Mr. Davies --
               who knows I'm pregnant. Could
               you...?

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               My lips are --

     Principal Barnes mimes "zipping" her lips.


32   EXT./INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY
                                                               32   *

     Kate walks in the front door to see    --                      *

     -- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An
     old record PLAYS on the record player.

                         KATE
               Hey...

                         CHARLIE
               Howdy.

     Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him.

                         KATE
               How was your day? And what's that
               smell?

                         CHARLIE
               Eh -- alright. Couldn't find
               oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.

                         KATE
                   (cringes)
               Charlie! You need to eat.

                          CHARLIE
               What? It's tasty.
                   (beat)
               So...I'm going to see that band                      *
               from Iceland with the triplets play                  *
               tonight. Want to come with me and
               Owen to check it out?
                                                44.


                    KATE
          Oh, that sounds fun, but...

                    CHARLIE
          C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls
          without you.

                    KATE
          I don't know...this guy I work with
          -- Mr. Davies --

                    CHARLIE
          The Vice Principal?

                    KATE
          Yeah -- turns out he's sober and
          invited me to a meeting.

                    CHARLIE
              (surprised)
          Wow, that's...uh, cool.

Charlie goes silent.

                       KATE
          What?

                    CHARLIE
          Nothing -- I just...I didn't think
          you really loved the meeting you
          went to yesterday. In fact, it
          sounded like you hated it. So I'm
          kinda surprised you're going back.

                    KATE
          Well...this is a smaller meeting.
          It might be different. I dunno -- I
          think I want to give it a fair
          shot.

Charlie nods.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          Besides -- I was hammered last
          night.
              (beat)
          Go on and have fun out drinking
          with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm
          just gonna, you know, try something         *
          different...

Charlie pulls Kate close to him.
                                                               45.


                         CHARLIE
               I'm here for you, okay? Even though
               I drink -- I could slow down if you
               need me to.
                   (forces a smile)
               I'm sure I could.


33   EXT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                       33

     Kate approaches a small church.

     Mr. Davies waits outside.


35   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
                                                               35

     Mr. Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where --

     -- about TEN PEOPLE are getting coffee, talking, and setting
     CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE.

     Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're
     very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting
     --

     -- several BLUE COLLAR MEN --

     -- JENNY: 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of        *
     tough demeanor --

     -- a few OLDER PEOPLE, and a YOUNG COUPLE.

     Mr. Davies directs Kate over to a table with COFFEE and
     COOKIES.

                         MR. DAVIES
               This is a little more my speed. No
               one here is the slightest bit hip.

                         KATE
               Does everybody just...kinda, you
               know -- talk here?

                         MR. DAVIES
               Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells
               their story. And then everyone else
               shares -- talks.

                         KATE
               So since you're taking me here does
               that make you my sponsor?
                                                         46.


                      MR. DAVIES
            No -- I don't think I could do                     *
            that.
                (off Kate's expression)
            `Cause, um...
                (nervously searches)
            ...well, it could get weird. But                   *
            I'll help you find one if you want.
                (gestures to the seats)
            We should sit down.

Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.

                      KATE
                (takes a deep breath; to
                 Mr. Davies)
            I can't believe I'm really here.

                      MR. DAVIES
            It gets better. Weirder, maybe --
            but better.

LATER

The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of
chairs.

Jenny is midway through her speech.                            *

                       JENNY                                   *
            ...all I knew about taking care of
            myself was fucking people over and
            lying to get by. I had no idea how
            to even look for a normal job or
            pay my bills on time -- or pay my
            fucking bills at all.
                (beat)
            Now I pay my bills online.

The group CHUCKLES.

                      JENNY (CONT'D)                           *
            And I found a love in cooking. I've                *
            got my own catering business now.                  *
            And...maybe I just replaced alcohol
            with chocolate chips and
            cigarettes, but still...it's been
            years since I woke up in a park --
            in a different state.

LAUGHTER.

Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers --
                                                        47.


                       KATE
             I kinda like her.

                       MR. DAVIES
             Sponsor potential?

Kate nods.

                       MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
             Get her number at break.

                       KATE
             I feel like you're my wingman.

Kate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away.

LATER

An older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces.

                       ARLO                                    *
             Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a
             ten minute break. Smoke em' if you
             got em.

As some of the PEOPLE go outside --

-- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.    *

                       KATE
             Hey, I liked your speech.

                        JENNY                                  *
             Thanks. All that dumb shit happened
             so I'm glad that now it's at least
             entertaining.
                 (beat)
             What's your name?

                       KATE
             Kate. This is my first meeting.
             Or... first meeting where I'm not
             wasted.

Jenny LAUGHS.                                                  *

                       JENNY                                   *
             Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some
             of that.

                       KATE
             I don't really know how this stuff
             works.
                       (MORE)
                                                        48.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          But...could I get your number? I
          mean, I may not need it, but...

                    JENNY                                     *
          Yeah, of course. I can help explain
          it to you -- and also, we can just
          talk.

                     KATE
          Okay. Yeah.
              (beat)
          You've been sober since you were
          24?

Jenny nods.                                                   *

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          That seems really young.

                     JENNY                                    *
          I didn't have much of a choice -- I
          crashed my car into a nursing home.
              (beat)
          I think the break is just about
          over. This meeting is the kind
          where everyone can share. Sharing
          always helps me, so...if it's not
          too weird -- try introducing
          yourself and telling the group
          what's going on.

LATER

Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next   *
to Kate is finishing up.

                    TINA                                      *
          ...anyway, that's where I'm at
          today. Thanks for listening.

Everyone looks at Kate.

                    KATE
          Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...
              (long beat)
          ...I'm an alcoholic?

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

                      GROUP
          Hi, Kate.
                                                                49.


                          KATE
               Sorry. I don't mean to laugh --
               it's just saying those words...
                   (beat)
               ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I
               don't really know. I drink -- a
               lot. I've always drank. Everyone I
               know drinks a lot. I never really
               thought I had a problem -- lately
               though it seems like maybe I do. I
               just want to be able to drink a
               beer without it turning into twenty
               -- or wetting my bed.
                   (beat)
               It seems like every time I drink
               something awful happens. All the
               shit that I used to laugh off isn't
               really funny anymore. The dumb
               drunk stuff has gone from
               embarrassing to scary.
                   (beat)
               I'm kinda...scared.

     Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

     A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:


35   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      35

     Kate sits at her desk grading papers. Kate's hand has an
     uncontrollable tremble as she tries to carefully make red
     checks on students' papers. Self-consciously, she steadies         *
     her right hand with her left.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

     while driving.

37   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                          37

     Kate is at a meeting -- talking to Jenny.                           *

38   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                 38

     While Kate and Charlie eat dinner, Kate drinks WATER but
     focuses on Charlie's glass of WINE and the slow, careful sips
     he takes.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

39   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              39

     Charlie and Owen play video games and LAUGH while Kate tries
     to concentrate on a book -- but is clearly distracted by how
     loud the guys are.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

     Charlie sleeps on the other side of the bed as Kate writes in
     a notebook. Kate stops writing. She stares at Charlie as he
     sleeps.

     Kate rides her bicycle hard. It might even be...exercise?

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

                         MR. DAVIES (V.O.)
               How about ninety days?

42   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                        42

     EVERYONE is dressed differently, some people have different
     hair-cuts, etc.

     Mr. Davies stands up, holding a PLASTIC CASE.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Is there anyone here who has ninety
               days of continuous sobriety?

     Kate stands up -- she looks way more "together" than she did
     earlier. She gives Mr. Davies a hug -- and he hands her a "90
     DAY CHIP."

                         KATE
               I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.

     Everyone CLAPS.

                           EVERYONE
               Hi, Kate.

     Kate sits down next to Jenny and gives her a hug.                 *

43   EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                       43   *

     Kate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with          *
     Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.              *

                         JENNY                                         *
               I'm really proud of you, Kate.

                          KATE
               I kinda can't believe it's been
               ninety days.
                   (beat)
               The longest I've gone since high
               school without drinking was, like,
               a week.

                         MR. DAVIES
               My first three months were such
               hell. I think I'm only sober today
               because I just never want to go
               through that again.
                                                52.


                    KATE
          It's weird -- in after-school
          specials the getting-sober part was
          only like a minute of the movie and
          suddenly...daddy's all okay.

Several people LAUGH.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          But it's so fucking hard and weird
          and suddenly I have all these other
          problems now that drinking isn't
          the problem.

          Like what?                                  *

                    KATE
          Everything else. Work, my non-
          existent relationship with my
          mom...

                    JENNY                             *
          When was the last time you saw her?

                    KATE
              (tries to remember)
          A year, at least.

                    JENNY                             *
          Well...maybe it's time.

                     KATE
          Maybe.
              (beat)
          And then there's my marriage. I
          mean, Charlie's great. Really
          great, he's supportive, especially
          at first. It's strange, though. I
          feel like alcohol was the thing
          that connected us and now that I
          don't drink we lead these two very
          different lives.
              (beat)
          We haven't slept together in
          forever...
              (laughs)
          I haven't pissed myself in awhile,
          though. So that's good.

                    JENNY                             *
          It takes time.

Kate gives an exasperated look.

                   (half-stern cheerleader

               Keep working the steps.
                   (glances at her watch)
               Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I
               should actually run you home now
               and come back. I need to start
               locking up.

                         KATE
               I could stick around and help
               you...

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (to Kate)
               I could take you home.
                   (off Kate's reaction)
               If you want.


44   INT./EXT. MR. DAVIES' CAR - NIGHT                 44   *

     Mr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house.

                         MR. DAVIES
               My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink --
               well, not like us, but as soon as I
               got sober I started to change and
               she just...didn't.

                         KATE
               I didn't know you were married.

     Beat.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Yeah, I was married once --
                   (laughs)
               -- in my other life. But I
               shouldn't be talking to you about
               this stuff.

                         KATE
               Why?

                         MR. DAVIES
               I don't know...

                         KATE
               Because you're a dude we can't
               talk? I don't get that "men stick
               with men, women stick with women"
               stuff.
                                                54.


                    MR. DAVIES
          Well, if you were sitting where I'm
          sitting you'd understand.

                    KATE
          Are you trying to tell me that you
          have a crush on me?

                    MR. DAVIES
          What am I, one of your students?            *
          Crush?

                    KATE
          Yeah, crush.

                     MR. DAVIES
              (long beat)
          I kind of do, yes. I have a crush
          on you. I know that's wrong --
          you're newly sober and married and
          I shouldn't be thinking about you
          like that. But yeah, I should put
          that out on the table.
              (beat)
          Honesty.

                    KATE
          It's okay. I think you're a really
          good guy.

                    MR. DAVIES
          Oh, great -- good guys are the
          nerds that carry the pretty girls'
          books.

                    KATE
          Oh, c'mon...

                    MR. DAVIES
          I think you're beautiful.

Kate smiles bashfully.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          And smart, and sexy, and cool...

Mr. Davies moves slightly closer to Kate.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          And I know it's wrong, but -- in
          meetings I stare at your lips and
          your legs and all I can think about
          is fucking your moist pussy.
                                                             55.


     Kate jumps back, aghast.

                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
                   (off Kate's horrified
                    expression)
               Oh, crap! I don't know why I just
               said that. I'm really, really
               sorry.

                         KATE
               WHAT THE FUCK?

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (genuinely sorry)
               Oh, that was a bad thing to say,
               right?

                           KATE
               YES.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I'm so, so sorry. I'm just
               confused, and I don't know how to
               talk to women --

                          KATE
               Jesus -- you can't just go around
               telling people you want to fuck
               their "moist pussy."
                   (beat)
               Who even says that?

                         MR. DAVIES
               I'm really sorry.

     Kate gets out of the car, slams the door shut, then leans in
     to say --

                          KATE
               I have to go inside my house --
               where I live with my husband.
                   (beat)
               Thanks for your creepy version of
               honesty.


45   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT             45

     Kate lies in bed and appears slightly bored as --

     -- Charlie is under the covers, going down on Kate.

                           KATE
               You okay?
                                                        56.


                    CHARLIE
              (from under the covers)
          Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The
          tortoise wins the race.

                    KATE
          Actually, I'm not really in the
          mood.

                    CHARLIE                                   *
          But I wanted to give you a 90 days
          gift.

                    KATE
          It's okay -- the 90 days was the
          gift.

                    CHARLIE
          Sorry if I was doing a bad job --
          I'm kinda hammered.

                    KATE
          It's alright. Charlie...
              (long beat)
          ...I miss you.

                    CHARLIE
          Huh?                                                *

Charlie comes up from under the covers -- and looks a bit     *
tipsy.                                                        *

                    KATE
          I mean...I don't know. I don't
          really feel connected to you
          anymore.

                    CHARLIE
          Did I do something?

                    KATE
          No.
              (beat)
          We don't talk that much.

                    CHARLIE
          We used to talk, but now you come
          home and go to meetings and by the
          time you get back I'm --

                    KATE
          Kinda drunk.
                                                   57.


                       CHARLIE
             I was gonna say "tired."

Silence.

                       KATE
             There's some stuff I need to do
             this weekend. I think I'm gonna go
             up to Lake Arrowhead.

                       CHARLIE
             Really? To see your mom?

Kate nods.

                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
             Why?

                       KATE
                 (defensive)
             Do I need a reason?

                        CHARLIE
             With your mom? Kinda.
                 (beat)
             Is this the "amends" step?

                       KATE
             No.

                       CHARLIE
             Well then why're you going?

                        KATE
                 (beat)
             We send her checks. But we never
             actually see her. Sometimes it
             feels like I'm paying her to not be
             in my life. I thought it would be
             nice to visit her.
                 (beat)
             And Jenny thinks it would be a good         *
             idea.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                       KATE (CONT'D)
             What?

                       CHARLIE
             I don't know...I mean, do you do
             everything your sponsor tells you
             to do?
                                                        58.


                          KATE
               No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or
               something?

                          CHARLIE
               I dunno...it's been a long damn
               time since you've seen your mom.
                   (beat)
               And you didn't listen when I
               suggested we visit her.

                          KATE
                   (suddenly gets that it's
                    an ego thing for Charlie)
               Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This
               just...it felt like the right time.
                   (beat)
               With all the changes I'm going
               through.

                         CHARLIE
               Well, can I come with you? It'll be
               like a little vacation.

                         KATE
               Um...I think I should go alone.

                         CHARLIE
               Come on, if you do that you'll just
               get depressed. If I go we can try
               to make it fun. Go hiking and
               stuff.

                          KATE
               Well, if you go, don't take this
               the wrong way but -- I'd like it if
               maybe you didn't drink.
                   (beat)
               Just while we're there.

                         CHARLIE
                   (smiles)
               I think I can handle not drinking
               for like a day.

     Kate smiles and snuggles up into Charlie's arms.


46   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                           46

     Kate and Charlie drive and listen to MUSIC.

      Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a --

      -- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin
      look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as
      well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES.

                          CHARLIE
                Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed
                those guys.

      Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    (waving to a lawn-gnome)
                Hi, Holger!

      Kate LAUGHS. Long beat.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                So...we gonna go in?

      Charlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face.


49    EXT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - DAY                              49

      Kate and Charlie walk to the front door.

                          KATE
                    (unsettled)
                I should've brought something.

                          CHARLIE
                You're fine.

                          KATE
                Something, you know? Flowers, or...

                          CHARLIE
                Wine?

                          KATE
                No. Definitely not that.

      They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like
      she'd be okay if they ran back to the car.
                                                        60.

Charlie KNOCKS.

                      FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          S'minute!

                     KATE
              (under her breath)
          Oh, God...

The door opens, revealing --

-- ROCHELLE: late-50's, wears an old shredded heavy metal
band T-shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys
an afternoon drink or three.

                    ROCHELLE
              (surprised)
          Katie!

Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate.

                    ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
          What're you doing here?

                    KATE
          I left you a message, mom.

                    ROCHELLE
          Oh, you know I don't check that
          thing.
              (notices Charlie; slightly
               flirty)
          Hello there, young man.

                    CHARLIE
          Hi, Ms. Foster.

                     ROCHELLE
          Well, then...
              (beat)
          ...what a lovely surprise -- you
          two came to visit. Hell has frozen
          over.
              (laughs)
          Just kidding. Come inside -- let me
          fix you both some drinks.

                    KATE
          Just water for me.
                                                             61.


     Rochelle LAUGHS as she leads the way. Kate glances at Charlie
     -- she already seems slightly annoyed.


50   INT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY             50

     Kate and Charlie sit down.

     The place is a MESS. Magazines and junkmail everywhere. Too
     much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner. The walls
     are covered with framed HEAVY METAL BAND POSTERS -- and there
     are ASHTRAYS everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette
     butts.

                         ROCHELLE (O.S.)
               ...you wouldn't believe how much
               the neighborhood's changed! After
               Mr. Baker passed away and the kids
               put Mrs. Baker in a home, the
               people that moved in, oof!

     Rochelle walks in holding a tray with THREE GIN AND TONICS.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               It's like they don't even
               understand the concept of birth
               control in their country!

     Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts
     a drink on the table in front of her.

                          ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
                   (confides)
               If you ask me, I think it's a meth
               house.
                   (beat)
               They've always got those little
               five year old twins "playing" in
               the yard, but I'm pretty sure
               they're the lookouts.

                         KATE
               That's pretty wild, mom.

                         ROCHELLE
               Right?
                   (notices that Kate hasn't
                    touched her drink)
               What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot
               how to mix `em?

                         KATE
               I told you I just wanted water.
                                                           62.


                    ROCHELLE
          Oh, please! Where I'm from, "no"
          means "yes."
              (to Charlie)
          Am I right or am I right?

                     CHARLIE
              (forcing it)
          Huh-huh...

                     KATE
          That's actually why I wanted to
          come up, mom.
              (beat)
          I stopped drinking.

Rochelle LAUGHS -- then realizes Kate and Charlie aren't
joking.

                     ROCHELLE
              (quickly serious)
          Are you telling me I'm going to be
          a grandma?

Rochelle tears up with joy.

                    ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
          Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna
          be a grandma!
              (to Charlie)
          And you know that "no drinking when
          you're pregnant" thing is just a
          myth. I drank plenty when I was
          pregnant with Kate -- and look how
          she turned out!

Beat.

                    KATE
          I'm not pregnant, mom.

                    ROCHELLE
          Oh.

                    KATE
          I just needed a break. I'm sober
          for the first time in years.

                    ROCHELLE
          Well...
              (dismissive)
          ...we'll see how long that lasts.
                                                63.


                    KATE
          It's been a while, actually.

                    CHARLIE
              (chimes in)
          90 days.

                     ROCHELLE
              (to Kate)
          You've sure picked the right
          partner --
              (gestures to Charlie)
          -- for this little mission.

                    CHARLIE
              (defensive)
          Hey -- I'm not drinking
          either...today.

                     KATE
              (to Charlie; slightly
               annoyed)
          Drink if you want to, Charlie.
              (to Rochelle)
          Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm
          doing it by myself.
              (beat)
          And...I started going to 12-step
          meetings.

Rochelle looks slightly disgusted.

                     ROCHELLE
          Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous.
              (to Charlie)
          Katie's father went to those
          meetings a few years after we got
          married. Dried up. Left me. You can
          see how well that worked out for
          me...
              (Rochelle gestures to her
                living room)
          ...I raised his daughter in this
          PALACE while he's somewhere in
          Florida with his shiny new wife and
          kids.
              (beat)
          Bastard.
              (long beat; to Charlie)
          You better be careful -- they
          change.

Kate and Charlie exchange a glance.
                                                               64.


                         KATE
               I thought you'd be happy for me,
               mom.

                         ROCHELLE
               Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a
               good hostess, am I?

     Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs
     it.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               I'll microwave you your favorite.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Charlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while
     eating...

     ...MCDONALDS CHEESEBURGERS.                                      *

     Rochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch.

                         KATE
               It's okay, mom. I know you can't
               help it.


51   EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY                 51

     Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village --

     -- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant
     ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the
     middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time.
     Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.

     Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.

                         KATE
               This place shut down a decade ago
               and then there was a fire and now
               it's basically abandoned.

     Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the
     place.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               We came here every year the week
               before Christmas.
                         (MORE)
                                                        65.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          And then I worked here in high
          school -- selling hot chocolate.
          And they had real reindeer, too.
          They kept `em over there.

Kate points at the remains of a PEN.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          My mom worked here when she was
          younger. I think everyone who grew                  *
          up around here worked at Santa's
          Village at some point.

Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          This is what I think of when I
          think of Christmas.
              (long beat)
          Thanks for coming up here with me.

                       CHARLIE
          Of course.

                    KATE
          I'm sorry my mom's so awful.

                    CHARLIE
              (shrugs)
          She just can't handle her liquor.

Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a
moment. And then Charlie asks --

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Did you ever hook up with guys when
          you worked here?

                       KATE
          Huh?

                    CHARLIE
          You know -- sneak off with a co-
          worker and do it against a pine
          tree or something?

                       KATE
          Um...no.
                                                             66.


                         CHARLIE
               I mean, if I were a teenage boy
               working with a stone cold fox like
               you I'd totally want to hook up
               with you here. Like...in the ginger
               bread house.

     Charlie puts his arms around Kate.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               You were probably the coolest girl
               in town -- and the prettiest. I'm
               sure everyone was in love with you.

     Kate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet.


52   OMITTED                                                   52    *


53   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  53

     Kate walks in to her class to find --

                           TEACHERS
               SURPRISE!

     -- a GROUP OF TEACHERS -- including Principal Barnes and Mr.
     Davies -- standing in the room, which has been decked out for
     a --

     -- BABY SHOWER.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I
               just had to tell everyone so we
               could celebrate.

                         KATE
                   (shock)
               Oh...you shouldn't have.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               You don't have to thank me -- just
               open your presents!

     Kate looks at her desk which is stacked with PRESENTS wrapped
     in pink and baby blue wrapping paper. There's also a CAKE.

                           KATE
               Wow...

                           PRINCIPAL BARNES
               Go ahead.
                                                             67.


                         OTHER TEACHERS
               `C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love
               what I got you! Is it a boy or a
               girl?

     LATER

     Kate opens a present -- a MOBILE.

                         KATE
                   (seems nauseous)
               Oh, it's so...nice.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
                   (enthusiastic)
               It's to hang over the crib!

                           KATE
               Uh-huh...

     MONTAGE: Kate opens presents while the teachers CLAP.

     Eventually, Kate begins to CRY -- which everyone assumes are
     tears of joy.

     Principal Barnes takes a bite of cake.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               Mmmm...it's so moist.

     Kate glances at Mr. Davies, who cringes.


54   EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  54

     Kate walks to her car.

                           MR. DAVIES (O.S.)
               Kate!

     Kate looks back to see Mr. Davies running over -- but she
     doesn't reply or slow down.

                           MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               Kate?

                         KATE
                   (stops)
               What?

                         MR. DAVIES
               Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You
               have no idea how much this has been
               eating me up.
                                                  68.


Long beat.

                        KATE
             What you said to me was really
             fucked up.

                       MR. DAVIES
             I know.

                       KATE
             What were you even thinking?

                       MR. DAVIES
             I wasn't -- I was just...I try to
             be really honest.

                       KATE
             I get that. But you can't force
             your "honesty" on everyone you
             know.

Mr. Davies nods. He looks really embarrassed.

                       KATE (CONT'D)
                 (changing tone)
             I'm flattered that you
             have...feelings for me. I am. But
             I'm married.

                       MR. DAVIES
             I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize
             to your husband if you want.

                       KATE
             No -- you don't have to do that. I
             didn't even tell him. But...you
             can't say that to a girl -- like,
             ever.

                       MR. DAVIES
             Okay.

                        KATE
             Seriously. Consider that a rule of
             thumb.
                 (beat)
             Someday, you're gonna meet a nice,
             available lady -- but if you say
             "moist pussy" to her, you will
             never, ever, ever get to see that
             part of her body!
                                                             69.


                           MR. DAVIES
                    (even more embarrassed)
                Okay.
                    (beat)
                Thank you.
                    (nods)
                I feel like this was a really good
                talk.

     Kate forces a smile.


55   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT             55

     Kate stares at a --

     -- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE ("OWEN" is still sort of legible)
     on the kitchen table. It's totally mutilated.

     She walks out the back door into the                            *

     BACKYARD                                                        *

     where she finds                                                 *

     Charlie, Owen, and one of Owen's friends --                     *

     -- GREG, 21 --                                                  *

     -- listening to loud MUSIC while they play FOOSBALL.            *

     They're all SHIT-HOUSED.                                        *

                          GREG                                       *
                ...getting married would fucking                     *
                suck. I can't even imagine waking                    *
                up to the same person for the rest                   *
                of my life.                                          *

     Kate walks out.                                                 *
             GREG (CONT'D)                           OWEN
     What's up, Kate?                Hey, Kate.

                          KATE                                       *
                I see you guys found the birthday                    *
                cake Jenny and I baked.                              *

                          OWEN                                       *
                Yeah, thanks! You should get a                       *
                slice.                                               *
                                                 70.

              (to Charlie)                             *
          I, uh...kinda thought we'd all eat           *
          it together.                                 *

                    CHARLIE                            *
          Baby -- I didn't even think about            *
          that. I'm sorry.                             *

                    OWEN                               *
          It was really good.                          *

                    GREG                               *
          We have plenty of tequila to make            *
          up for the cake.                             *

                    OWEN                               *
          Kate's in AA -- so she can't drink.          *
          She hasn't drank in forever -- like          *
          thirty-eight days or some shit.              *

                    KATE                               *
          Ninety-five days, actually.                  *

                    GREG                               *
          That sucks! Do you still smoke               *
          weed?                                        *

                    KATE                               *
          No, I wasn't a big weed smoker               *
          anyway.                                      *

                    OWEN                               *
          You smoked crack though, didn't              *
          you?                                         *

Kate's face goes blank. She stares at Charlie.         *

                    GREG                               *
          Shit -- I hear crack gets you so             *
          high!                                        *

                    CHARLIE                            *
          No -- my wife doesn't smoke crack.           *
          Jesus...                                     *

                    OWEN                               *
          What? I'm joking around. I know              *
          Kate's not a crackhead or some               *
          shit.                                        *
              (to Kate)                                *
          It was just that one time, right?            *
                                                                71.

               It's your birthday, man, so I'm not                     *
               gonna make a big deal out of this --                    *
               but you need to shut the fuck up                        *

57   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT -     57   *
     MOMENTS LATER

     Charlie walks in to see Kate getting ready to go to bed.          *

                         CHARLIE
               Listen -- I'm sorry. He's
               drunk...really drunk.

                         KATE
               I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at
               you! You said you wouldn't tell
               anyone about what I did.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when
               I told him.

                          KATE
               Great.
                   (beat)
               Why don't you guys just go to the
               bar now?

                         CHARLIE
               You wanna come?

                         KATE
               I'm hanging here.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm sure they have near-beer, baby.
               It'll be fun.

                         KATE
               I'm staying in.
                                                              72.


                         CHARLIE
               That sounds like a lot of fun.

                         KATE
               Bye.

     Beat.

                         CHARLIE
               I love you.

     Kate doesn't say a word.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I love you...?

                         KATE
               Yeah...
                   (long beat)
               ...I love you too.


58   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MORNING                 58

     Kate stands at the BLACKBOARD -- teaching addition and
     subtraction to the class.

     A little girl -- ISABEL -- raises her hand.                       *

                         KATE
               Yes?

                         ISABEL                                        *
               Mrs. Hannah -- shouldn't you be
               more fatter?

                         KATE
               What?

                         ISABEL                                        *
               `Cause of the baby. My mom got real
               fat.

                         KATE
                   (taken off-guard)
               Well..."Shouldn't you be fatter?"
               is the correct way to ask that
               question.

     Kate goes back to the board -- clearly wanting to move on.
                                                           73.


                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Now, one day when you're very old
          and wise fourth graders, you'll
          learn about multiplication and --

                    ISABEL                                       *
          Mrs. Hannah -- Shouldn't you be
          more fat?

All the students look at Kate. She's on the spot. Flustered.

                       KATE
          Well, I...

Kate searches for something to say. Anything. But then she
blurts --

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          ...I'm not going to have a baby.

                       CLASS
          OOOH!

Kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it
back.

                    KATE
          See -- I was pregnant but, it
          wasn't my time, I suppose...

Another little girl -- WINNIE -- jumps in.                       *

                    WINNIE                                       *
          Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the
          baby?

                    KATE
          WHAT? No -- of course not!

                    WINNIE                                       *
          `Cause my mom says that when you
          kill a baby you go to hell and you
          can't even go to church to ask god
          for forgiveness.

The students begin to WHISPER to each other.

Another boy -- TOBY -- asks --

                    TOBY
          Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to
          hell?
                                                          74.


                             KATE
                  No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay,
                  listen kids -- we shouldn't be
                  talking about this. But...
                      (beat)
                  ...sometimes women get pregnant and
                  then early on -- before it's even a
                  baby -- they stop being pregnant.

                            WINNIE                               *
                  Because a doctor murders it!

                             KATE
                  No -- not because a doctor   murdered
                  it.
                      (beat)
                  It's called a miscarriage.   That
                  means it wasn't my plan --   it's
                  just what happened.
                      (composes herself)
                  Does anyone want to ask me   any
                  questions?

     The class nods but seems silently freaked out.

                            KATE (CONT'D)
                  Let's get back to subtraction -- or
                  addition. Or both.


59   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        59

     Kate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch.

                            MR. DAVIES
                  Well, that was bound to happen at
                  some point. Kids notice things like
                  that.

     Kate nods.

                             MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
                  But I had no idea how pro-life
                  little Winnie Reddy is.                        *
                      (beat)
                  Remind me to wear my "May the fetus
                  you save be gay" T-shirt to the
                  next banana split night.

     Kate half-laughs.
                                                             75.


                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               And just think: the kids got a
               lesson about life and death that
               nobody planned on. I mean, you're
               years ahead of the standard
               curriculum for, uh, third graders.

                         KATE
               Does it matter that I lied? That I
               was never pregnant?

                         MR. DAVIES
               You want me to answer that as a
               friend or as someone who takes the
               twelve steps very seriously?

     Kate shrugs.

                          MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               Well, the good thing is that it's
               all over now. Principal Barnes will
               think you're a martyr for losing a
               baby.
                   (beat)
               The kids won't ask about it anymore
               and as long as you don't toss your
               cookies again you won't have to
               deal with it.

                         KATE
                   (long beat)
               And the bad news?

                         MR. DAVIES
               You lied. To your boss -- and a
               bunch of small children. Who trust
               you. And rely on you to help them
               differentiate right from wrong.

                         KATE
                   (slowly nods)
               That's all, huh?


60   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING          60   *
     ROOM/KITCHEN/BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   *

     Kate and Charlie eat TAKE-OUT FOOD in SILENCE. Kate texts on
     her CELL PHONE -- not even paying attention to Charlie.

                            CHARLIE
               Well...
                   (beat)
                            (MORE)
                                                76.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          ...I gotta say -- this is the
          boringest meal I've had in about as
          long as I can remember.

Kate doesn't look up.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Who're you texting?

                    KATE
              (still looking down)
          Jenny.                                      *

                    CHARLIE
          She's like a parole officer.

                    KATE
          She's my sponsor.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm glad to know every little fuck-
          up I have is gonna become a topic
          of conversation with some chick I
          don't even know.

Kate finishes her text. Puts down her phone.

                    KATE
              (fake enthusiasm)
          So...what'd you do today, honey?

                     CHARLIE
          I finished some writing and met up
          with Owen to watch the game and
          toss a few back. Dear.
              (beat)
          You do anything special?

                    KATE
          I lied to my class again. I told
          them that I had a miscarriage.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          That's not funny.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up
          stuff is totally funny...in, you
          know -- a kinda fucked-up way.
                                              77.


                  KATE
        Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not
        actually having a baby.

                  CHARLIE
        God, Kate -- come on. What else
        were you supposed to do?

                   KATE
        Well, I feel like a piece of shit
        for lying.

                  CHARLIE
        It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is
        this what those meetings teach you?
        To make drama out of nothing?

                  KATE
        It's not nothing. I lied to little
        kids and to my boss because I can't
        take responsibility for my actions.

                  CHARLIE
        Why don't you go and tell the
        Principal that you were never
        pregnant? That the reason you puked
        is because you smoked crack all
        night? Would you feel better about
        yourself then?

Beat.

                  KATE
        I've been thinking about doing
        that, actually.
            (thinks about it)
        Yeah. I think I would feel better
        about myself.

                  CHARLIE
        Fine. Do it, then. I guess you
        don't need a job.

                  KATE
        I could be like you -- I could stay
        home drinking all day and never do
        anything responsible.

                   CHARLIE
            (hurt)
        I never do anything responsible?
        What about buying this house that
        we live in? Or the food that we're
        eating?
                                                 78.


                    KATE
          Having rich parents doesn't make
          you responsible. I think it's
          pretty much done the opposite.

Charlie looks stunned.                                 *

                    CHARLIE
          Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family
          that supports us -- and not the
          other way around.

                    KATE
          What the fuck is that supposed to
          mean?

                    CHARLIE
          Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad
          at me because my family has helped
          us out. You should be grateful we
          don't have to struggle.

                     KATE
          I wouldn't care if we struggled
          with money. I've struggled with
          money my whole life.
              (beat)
          I'd rather worry about where my
          next meal is coming from than if I -
          - in some drunken stupor -- married
          a man who just wants to party and
          meet bands.

                    CHARLIE
          What the fuck are you talking
          about?

                    KATE
          I'm talking about you being a baby.
          A selfish baby.

                    CHARLIE
          You know what?

                    KATE
          What?

                    CHARLIE
          I fucking hate AA! It turned you
          into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.

                    KATE
          At least I'm not drunk all the
          time.
                                                               79.


                         CHARLIE
               Yeah, you don't drink booze for
               three months and suddenly you're
               some saint? You have it all
               together and I'm just a baby?

     Kate doesn't answer.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to
               understand you. But it's hard.
               You're different and maybe it's
               good that you're different. Maybe
               I'm bad and bad for you or
               something -- because I didn't think
               the person you were before was so
               awful. I loved that person. Yeah,
               she drank a lot and she did some
               silly things...but she was my Kate.

                         KATE
               You loved that person? Do you not
               love me now?

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah, of course. But it's
               different. You're different.

                          KATE
               Before I was a mess.
                   (beat)
               I'm finally getting my life
               together -- and you loved me more
               before?

     Charlie looks at the floor.

                          CHARLIE
                   (soft)
               Kinda, yeah.

     Charlie looks like he immediately regrets what he said.


61   INT./EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                 61   *

     Kate follows Jenny from her patio to her kitchen as she          *
     cleans up.                                                       *

                         KATE
               I feel so fucking weird right now --
               Charlie doesn't love me like he
               used to and I've lied to my
               students multiple times.
                         (MORE)

             I just don't feel...normal right
             now.

             Well, you're not normal.
                 (beat)
             None of us are.

                       KATE
             Everything in life isn't connected
             to being an alcoholic.

                        JENNY                            *
             I'm not just talking about
             alcoholics.
                 (beat)
             People are fucking weird. We all
             have a lot of shit we carry around
             in our heads that doesn't make
             sense.
                 (beat)
             At least alcoholics have tools to
             work through it.                            *

             Yeah, steps -- and talking and
             listening and crying...

                       KATE
             I have the crying part covered.

                        JENNY                            *
             I know, right? I think my first
             year I cried tears I'd been saving
             since I was eight.
                 (beat)
             It's hard to live your
             life...honestly. You know?

Kate nods.

                        JENNY (CONT'D)                   *
             Any idea what you're gonna do about
             your school situation? What you're
             gonna say?

Kate shakes her head.
                                                             81.


                         KATE
               I don't know what I'm gonna do
               about anything.

                         JENNY                                         *
               Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     *
               room tonight? You can watch movies,
               get some good sleep...?

                         KATE
               You sure that's okay?

                          JENNY                                        *
               Yeah, of course. That's why I spent
               money on a guest bed -- so people
               could sleep in it.
                   (beat)
               I know it might feel like it, but
               really, you don't have to figure
               everything out tonight.
                   (smiles)
               You've got time.


62   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                     62

     Kate goes into her classroom and finds a NOTE on the desk.


63   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            63

     Principal Barnes hugs Kate.

                          PRINCIPAL BARNES
               I'm so sorry, Kate.
                   (beat)
               I haven't told many people this,
               but when I was young -- younger
               than you...I lost a child too.

     Kate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible.

                         KATE
               I'm...I'm really sorry.

                          PRINCIPAL BARNES
               It's okay. It was a long, long time
               ago. Still hurts sometimes. But
               eventually...you move on. You have
               to.
                   (beat)
               Have a seat.

     Kate sits down.
                                                        82.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          I got a phone call from a very
          upset parent. That's how I found
          out about...you know. Frankly, I'm
          not sure why you didn't feel like
          you could tell me.

                    KATE
          I freaked out -- a student asked
          why I wasn't fat and I just froze
          up and then another student was
          saying I killed my baby and I
          didn't know what to do.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I'm not angry with you -- but I
          need to be clear that this doesn't
          happen again.

                    KATE
          It won't. I promise that.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          By "not happening again," I mean
          that you don't discuss any
          controversial topics -- things the
          school board deems "family matters"
          with your class.
              (beat)
          No sex. No god. No drugs and
          alcohol.

                       KATE
          Okay, I...

Kate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She
seems...exhausted.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          ...I can't keep doing this. I feel
          awful.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (confused)
          I know this all must be hard for
          you --

                     KATE
          No. You don't understand.
              (beat)
          I have to be honest with you.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          What do you mean?
                                                    83.


                    KATE
          Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever
          pregnant.

Principal Barnes looks shocked.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I lied -- to the class and to you --
          because I was scared.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          But...you vomited in class.

                    KATE
          I know. And when that happened I
          didn't know what to do because the
          truth is --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, my god -- are you really ill?
          Is it cancer?

                     KATE
          No, well, yes. I have a disease,
          but, um...
              (beat)
          ...it's alcoholism.

Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          What?

                    KATE
          I've been working on it. I'm one-
          hundred days sober. When that
          happened I'd been out drinking and
          was hung over and --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          You vomited in front of children
          because you were hung over?

                    KATE
          Yes.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          And lied, saying that you were
          pregnant?

                    KATE
          Well, a student asked if I was
          pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of
          fell out of my mouth.
                                                84.


Principal Barnes looks disgusted.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          That's sick, Kate.

                       KATE
          I know.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          No, I don't think you understand
          how wrong that is. To lie to me --
          to the children. You know I felt so
          terrible for you when I found out
          that you had a mis -- ?
              (beat)
          -- how can you play with people's
          emotions like that?

                    KATE
          I was sick.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Jesus...you told us you had a
          miscarriage.

                       KATE
          I'm sorry.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I threw you a baby shower.

                     KATE
          I'm really sorry. I am. I've been
          wanting to tell you the truth
          because honesty has become really
          important to me. I'm in AA now and
          doing the steps and working with a
          sponsor and everything.
              (beat)
          It's really hard. I mean, I think
          my husband might hate me, and --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I'm sorry, but what you did is
          totally irresponsible.

                       KATE
          I know.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (beat)
          I can't have you here anymore.
                                                        85.


                    KATE
              (surprised)
          Am I being fired?

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          No, no -- the state wouldn't allow
          that without a report. I'm not
          going to write a report. Because,
          frankly, I have no idea what that
          report would say.
              (beat)
          But I'm forcing you to take a leave
          of absence and I think it's in your
          best interest if you find a job
          elsewhere.

                    KATE
          Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm
          doing the right things now.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I believe you -- or I want to. I
          really do. But honey -- I believed
          you before.
              (beat)
          I'll have a sub take over your
          class starting tomorrow. It's late
          enough in the year that we can just
          say you're having personal problems
          --

Principal Barnes looks at Kate.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          -- which seems to be the truth.

                    KATE
          Principal Barnes --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Not another word. I'm upset right
          now -- very upset -- and I think
          I'm doing you a favor by not
          reporting you.

Kate struggles to say something, to try to explain herself
but no words come out until she musters --

                       KATE
          Thank you.

Kate stands, defeated, and leaves the Principal's office.
                                                             86.


64   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - STAIRS/HALLWAY - DAY               64   *

     Kate glumly marches down the stairs -- holding a BOX filled      *
     with some of her things (including the BABY SHOWER GIFTS).

     Mr. Davies stops her.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Kate -- what's going on?

                         KATE
               I told Principal Barnes about
               everything.

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (terrified)
               What? Everything? Did you tell her
               about...?

     Mr. Davies gestures to Kate's crotch.

                            KATE
                      (confused)
               Huh?
                   (gets it)
               Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm
               an alcoholic. And that I lied. And
               she fired me.

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (relieved)
               Oh...
                   (but concerned, too)
               ...my god, Kate -- I'm sorry.

                          KATE
               I've been going to AA and trying to
               be sober and this is what it got
               me.
                   (beat)
               Fired, for telling the truth.

     Mr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I'm sorry. I wish there was
               something I could do.

                         KATE
               I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a
               fuck up. I'm just like my mom.
                                                               87.


                         MR. DAVIES
                   (confused)
               No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart
               woman Kate. You can't let this get
               you down.

                         KATE
               I gotta go.

     Mr. Davies takes Kate's box of things from her.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Let me walk you to your car.

     Kate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to --

     -- full-on SOB.

     Mr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to
     comfort Kate.


65   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                                   65

     Kate cries as she drives.

     She glances in the backseat at --

     -- all the baby shower gifts --

     -- and sobs even harder.


66   INT. DIVE BAR - DAY                                          66

     Kate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously
     sits at the bar.

     The BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      *
     up -- approaches.

                         BARTENDER
               What do you need?

                         KATE
               Whiskey. Double.

     The bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs
     it.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Can I have another one?
                                                        88.


                    BARTENDER
          Sure -- you gotta pay for the first
          one, though. Eight bucks.

Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down.

The bartender pours her another shot.

LATER

Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up
at the bar, nursing her BEER.

                    BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a
          downer or anything `cause I take it
          you've had a bad day, but um... I
          think you need to go home.

                       KATE
          Why?

                    BARTENDER
          Cause you're pretty drunk -- and
          it's four p.m.

                    KATE
          What about him?

Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          You're not kicking him out.

                    BARTENDER
          I'm just trying to be a pal.

                     KATE
          Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I
          just got fired, and I just quit AA.
              (beat)
          It didn't work.

                       BARTENDER
          Oh, boy...

                    KATE
          You know what? I was fine -- had a
          husband that loved me and maybe I
          sometimes did embarrassing stuff,
          but it was a phase.
                    (MORE)
                                                        89.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I go to AA and sober my husband and
          I start fighting and stop fucking --
          and sober I get fired! Isn't that
          what's supposed to not happen?

                     BARTENDER
          Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry.
          But this place gets a little nuts
          after sundown and I don't think a
          pretty girl who just left AA should
          be here.
              (beat)
          I'm gonna call you a cab.

                    KATE
          NO! I don't want a cab. I want --
              (glances around)
          -- drugs. Can you hook me up?

The bartender rolls his eyes.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...let's go out back and smoke
          some crack.

                    BARTENDER
          Lady, you're done.

                    KATE
          You think I'm above smoking crack?
          `Cause I'm not. And are you really
          gonna tell me you're not a little
          attracted to me...?

Kate leans across the bar, trying to look "seductive" -- but
she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool.

                      BARTENDER
          No.

                    KATE
          Just a teensy bit...?

                    BARTENDER
          Not in the slightest.

                    KATE
          Well...you might want to consider
          investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause
          I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm
          smart. And I'm...

Kate begins to cry.
                                                             90.


                         KATE (CONT'D)
               ...a good person.

                         BARTENDER
               I think it's time for you to go
               home. Now are you gonna let me call
               a cab?

                         KATE
                   (suddenly angry)
               NO! I'm not. I've got friends.
               They'll pick me up.

                         BARTENDER
               You do that.

                         KATE
               I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams
               about me.

     The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though he's
     trying to size up if she's insane.

                         BARTENDER
               Hope that works out for you.

                          KATE
               Can't believe my luck. I just want
               to get drunk and a bartender won't
               let me.
                   (beat)
               Life is stupid.

     Kate stands up -- almost falling over -- and glares at the
     bartender.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               You hear me? Life is FUCKING
               STUPID!

     Kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar, winks at
     him, then picks up his drink and chugs it.


67   INT. MR. DAVIES' CAR (MOVING) - DAY                          67   *

     Kate is slumped in the back seat.

     In the front seat is Mr. Davies and Jenny.                        *

                         KATE
               Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd
               you bring her?
                                                             91.


                          JENNY                                     *
                We're worried about you, Kate.

                          KATE
                    (accusing)
                Parole officer.

                          MR. DAVIES
                She's your sponsor.

                          JENNY                                     *
                It's gonna be okay. You stumbled.
                You'll get back up.

     Silence.

                          KATE
                How `bout we drive to Mexico and
                party our asses off? My treat.

     Jenny and Dave glance back at Kate --                          *

     -- whose face reveals what a bad state she's in.

                          KATE (CONT'D)
                    (holding back tears)
                Sounds fucking stupendous, right?


68   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY                         68

     Kate gets out of the car.                                      *

     Mr. Davies and Jenny watch with concerned expressions as --    *

     -- Kate stumbles to her front door.

                          JENNY                                     *
                Kate! Are you sure you're --

                          KATE
                    (over her shoulder)
                Fuck off.


69   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING                      69
     ROOM/KITCHEN/HALLWAY/BEDROOM - DAY                             *

     Charlie plays a VIDEO GAME -- with the TV hooked up through
     his STEREO SPEAKERS.

     Kate opens the doors and walks in, wobbly.
                                                           92.


                    CHARLIE
              (not looking up)
          Babe -- you gotta hear this with
          the speakers hooked up. It's
          insane.

Kate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie.

Charlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly
drunk.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Whoa...what happened to you?

Charlie stops playing the game.

                    KATE
          I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.

                      CHARLIE
          Oh, no...

                    KATE
          We got any drinks?

                    CHARLIE
          Uh...we have soda. I can make
          coffee.

                    KATE
          Don't be cute with me. You know
          what I mean.

                    CHARLIE
          So...I guess you aren't doing the
          AA thing anymore?

                    KATE
          What gave that away?

Kate turns and goes to the kitchen --

-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt
and limes.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Come on, baby -- let's do some
          shots.

                    CHARLIE
          What's going on?
                                                        93.


                    KATE
          I'm celebrating. What the fuck does
          it look like?

Kate takes a shot.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Are you gonna be a little girl or
          are you gonna drink with me?

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know what the right thing
          to do here is.

                     KATE
          Okay, so let me see if this makes
          sense: you say you miss the old
          Kate -- the Kate who drinks and
          blacks out and has fun.
              (beat)
          Well...here she is.

Kate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than
fun.

                    CHARLIE
          Baby, I didn't mean that. I was
          just being a jerk.

                    KATE
          Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now
          you won't drink with me?

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know. Having a beer or
          something is one thing, but...I
          think you really may have a
          problem.

Kate LAUGHS.

                    KATE
          Well thanks for all the support
          when I was trying to be sober!

Kate takes another shot.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm sorry. I didn't realize --

                    KATE
          Of course you didn't realize! You
          don't fucking care about me.
                                                        94.


                    CHARLIE
          What are you talking about?! Of
          course I care about you. I love
          you.

Kate takes a shot and approaches Charlie.

                    KATE
          I love you too. Love is the easy
          part. It's the rest of the shit
          that's hard.

Kate kisses Charlie.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Take off your pants.

Charlie gently pushes Kate away.

                    CHARLIE
          Look -- I think you should get to
          sleep. You're really wasted.

                    KATE
          I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.

Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the
couch...and straddles him.

                    CHARLIE
          Please, will you stop?

                    KATE
          No! I want you to fuck me!

Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him.

                    CHARLIE
          Really. This is weird.

                    KATE
          Be a man and fuck your wife!

Charlie -- who's creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate
off.

                    CHARLIE
          No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong
          with you?

Kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point --
and begins picking up HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS and throwing them at
Charlie.
                                                        95.


                    KATE
          With me? With me?! What the fuck is
          wrong with me? I try hard and I get
          shit on! Fucked up family, fired
          from my job -- this marriage.
          Nothing's wrong with me! What's
          wrong with YOU?!

                    CHARLIE
          Kate, you need to --

                    KATE
          What? What? What do I need? I can't
          drink because I'm crazy or
          something and I can't stay sober
          because of you!

                    CHARLIE
          You're blaming other people for
          your problems.

Kate picks the tequila bottle back up, takes a sip, then --

-- runs at Charlie and tackles him to the ground.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Stop it! You're acting like a
          freak!

Kate rips Charlie's SHIRT --

-- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him,
as if she's about to hit him with it.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          No! What's wrong with you?

Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie.
She begins to weep.

                    KATE
          I can't be sober and be with you.

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like
she's about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on
tight. With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle.
                                                               96.


                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

70   INT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - KITCHEN - DAY                 70   *

     Kate wears a UNIFORM and carefully works on a CAKE.                 *

     On the other side of the kitchen, Jenny makes APPETIZERS.           *

                         JENNY                                           *
               How's it coming?

                         KATE
               You tell me.

     Jenny walks over and tries the icing.                               *

                          JENNY                                          *

71   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                          71

     A middle-aged MAN stands at a podium in front of a medium
     sized group of PEOPLE -- about twenty-five or so, including
     Kate, Jenny, and Mr. Davies -- and says --                          *

                          CHUCK                                          *
               At this meeting we give cakes to
               celebrate sober birthdays. We have
               one birthday tonight -- for Kate,
               for one year.
                   (beat)
               Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         *
               cake.

     Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE
     before standing at the podium.

                         KATE
               Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.

                           GROUP
               Hi, Kate.
                                                 97.


                     KATE
          I've heard that your best day
          drinking is worse than your worst
          day sober.
              (beat)
          Well...that is SO not true! I had
          amazing times drinking, dancing,
          and laughing...feeling like the
          most adorable, charming girl in the
          world. And I was adorable.
              (beat)
          I'd piss my pants, but I was still
          cute.

People in the crowd LAUGH a little bit.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          When I first tried getting sober, I
          figured that as long as I didn't
          drink...everything else would just
          magically work out. But it didn't.
              (beat)
          My marriage fell apart. I got fired
          from my job. And that shit happened
          SOBER! I never read that in any
          pamphlet...
              (shakes her head)
          ...that isn't what I signed up for.
                (beat)
          Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty
          slogan I've heard in the rooms is
          that when you're sober for a bit
          and drink again "the disease waits
          for you, picks up where it left
          off."
              (beat)
          I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE
          those slogans. They all sound like
          bumper stickers. But, I have to
          admit...for me, that last one is
          pretty damn true.
              (beat)
          When I drink...I become another
          person. And that person is a pretty
          big asshole. Well, unless you want
          to give me drugs or buy me drinks --
          then that person is awesome.

People knowingly LAUGH.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I wasn't happy being the "good-time
          girl," though. And honestly, I
          wasn't very good at it.
                    (MORE)
                                                             98.

                          KATE (CONT'D)
                   (beat)
               My life is really different than it
               was a year ago. I live alone. I'm
               bored a lot more. I have a job that
               pays a lot less.
                   (beat)
               I'm thankful for the program -- for
               my friends in here who took the
               time to help me and give a shit
               about me.

     Kate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.                             *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               There are people that used to be a
               part of my life that I miss -- a
               lot -- but...
                   (long beat)
               ...I'm really grateful for this
               boring new life of mine.

     Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP.


72   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                             72   *

     Charlie, Owen, and a woman -- MILLIE -- stand at the bar,
     drinking BEER and WHISKEY SHOTS. Owen speaks -- but Millie
     seems way more into Charlie.

                           OWEN
               I was in North Carolina for a while                     *
               -- Durham -- playing minor league
               ball. I had some real heat. That's
               when I met Crash, here.
                    (gestures to Charlie)
               He'd been sent down to single-A to
               teach me how to carry myself as a
               pro ball-player. We got involved
               with the same woman -- an older
               chick -- but Crash won her in the
               end.
                    (beat)
               He's really taught me
               some...important life-lessons.

     Millie nods.

                         MILLIE
               Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to
               meet.

                         OWEN
               Yeah. It is.
                                                         99.


                    MILLIE
          You guys are sorta like that
          movie...what's it called?

                    OWEN
              (plays dumb)
          I don't know. Which one?
              (to Charlie)
          Do you know what movie she means?

Charlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head.

                    MILLIE
          "Bull"...something? What is it?

Charlie and Owen feign ignorance.

                    MILLIE (CONT'D)
          Whatever. It'll come to me.
              (to Charlie; flirty)
          So...what do you do now, Crash?

                    CHARLIE
          I write about music.

                       MILLIE
          Really?

Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of
          magazines. But print really is
          dead. So now most of my stuff winds
          up on websites. Which is
          depressing. `Cause you can't hold
          it -- you can just look at it. It's
          like...

Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence.
Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm.

                       MILLIE
          Like what?

                       CHARLIE
          Huh?

                    MILLIE
          You were talking about writing for
          websites and you kinda trailed off,
          honey.
                                                   100.


                    OWEN
              (trying to save the
               situation)
          So, Crash -- why don't you tell
          this nice lady about the 21 days
          you were up in "The Show," and what
          the crowds were like, and --

                    CHARLIE
          It was crazy. I...

Charlie drifts off for a moment.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
              (to Millie)
          I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a
          great lady. You have lovely hands
          and hair but...

Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          ...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just
          gonna go.

Charlie stumbles off.

                    MILLIE
              (as Charlie leaves)
          You want a ride...?

Charlie exits the bar.

                    MILLIE (CONT'D)
              (to Owen)
          Um...is he cool to drive?

                    OWEN
          Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his
          bicycle.

                    MILLIE
          He rides a bicycle?

                     OWEN
          Oh, yeah --
              (smiles)
          -- as a teenager, he was a bike
          racing champion growing up in
          Bloomington, Indiana. He and his
          friends were called the "Cutters" --
          and they beat a bunch of rich
          college kids in this big race. It
          was great.

73   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                         73

     Charlie rides his BICYCLE down the street. Swerving all over
     the place, he's obviously drunk.

     Red and Blue LIGHTS flash behind him. Charlie turns to see --

     -- a POLICE OFFICER.                                             *


74   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             74

     Charlie leaves Kate a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.

                          CHARLIE
                   (into phone; seems sort of
                    nervous)
               So, I got into a little trouble --
               drunk in public. On a bicycle.
                   (beat)
               Um, I was thinking...maybe I need
               to go to one of those meetings. I'd
               like to go with you, though. If
               that's cool.
                   (beat)
               Let me know if we could discuss it
               sometime, okay? Maybe you could
               come over to our -- um, my house?
                   (beat)
               Uh...yeah. Thanks.

     Charlie hangs up the phone.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (to himself)
               "Let me know if we could discuss it
               sometime?"
                   (shakes his head)
               Such an idiot...


75   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STREET/FRONT YARD - DAY       75   *

     Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in
     front by the street. She's just arrived. Awkward tension.

                         CHARLIE
               Miss our house?
                                                       102.


                     KATE
           Um...yeah. Sometimes.

                     CHARLIE
               (hesitant)
           Miss me?

Beat.

                      KATE
           Sometimes.
               (long beat)
           I've been sober for a year.

                       CHARLIE
           Really?

                       KATE
           Yeah.

Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her ONE YEAR CHIP,
showing it to Charlie.

                     CHARLIE
           They gave you that?

                     KATE
           Yeah. A couple of days ago.
           Tuesday.

                      CHARLIE
           Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's
           really...really...just great. I
           mean it.
               (beat)
           Tuesday is the night I got pulled
           over.
               (laughs)
           Parallel lives, huh?

Kate rolls her eyes.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           So -- you dating anyone?

                      KATE
               (taken aback)
           Charlie...

                       CHARLIE
           Are you?

Silence.
                                                103.


                    KATE
          No.

Charlie seems relieved.

                     CHARLIE
          Me either. Owen keeps trying to get
          me to be his "wing-man" and it's
          ridiculous and these girls in bars
          are so lame and I just keep
          thinking how I wish I was meeting
          you in a bar for the first time and
          I didn't come with any baggage and
          I could buy you a drink and flirt
          with you all night and ask for your
          number.
              (beat)
          Wanna go out sometime?

                    KATE
          I don't think it's a good idea.

Charlie nods. Long beat.

                    CHARLIE
          I fucked up, didn't I?

Kate looks down, doesn't speak.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a
          beautiful woman who used to love me
          and now when I see her she doesn't
          even want to look me in the eyes.

                    KATE
          Charlie, please don't do this.

                    CHARLIE
          I miss you. I miss the way you
          taste and smell and...I miss things
          about you that used to drive me
          nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's
          music and fake punk-rock from the
          90's...

                     KATE
          I don't like shitty 80's music.
              (beat)
          I like good 80's music.
                                                               104.


                         CHARLIE
               ...and all I want to do is touch
               you one more time to just, remember
               -- to make sure it was real.

     Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a
     slight smile.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (changing course)
               Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional
               fucking idiot.


76   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY      76   *

     Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a
     number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general,
     the room looks more "dude."

                         KATE
               You look really thin.

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah?

                         KATE
               When did you last eat?

                         CHARLIE
               I dunno -- like...I'm not sure.
                   (seems slightly concerned                           *
                    that he can't remember)
               I think, um...

                         KATE
               Should we order something?

                         CHARLIE
               Sure, yeah -- or I could make a
               bacon and egg sandwich...

                         KATE
               I don't know. I haven't really been
               doing the meat thing.

                          CHARLIE
               Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then
               meat.
                   (beat)
               Have you given up fun, too?

     Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she
     finds him funny.
                                                             105.


                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (off Kate)
               Sorry. Bad joke.

     Kate cracks a smile.

                         KATE
               Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But
               I'm gonna make them.

     Charlie raises his eyebrows.

                            CHARLIE
               Okay...

     LATER

     Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs.

     Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER.

     Kate glances at him.

                            CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Sorry.

     Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.

                         KATE
               I don't care if you drink a beer.

                            CHARLIE
               You sure?

                         KATE
               Yeah. Whatever.

                         CHARLIE
                   (thinks about it)
               No...I'm good.

     LATER

     Kate stands by the stove and watches as --

     -- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the
     bacon and egg sandwich.

     Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.


77   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - TWILIGHT          77

     Kate and Charlie play croquet.                                  *
                                                          106.


They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a
while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.

                       CHARLIE
             Have you been playing a lot?

                       KATE
             I haven't played in over a year.

                       CHARLIE
             Then how're you beating me?

                       KATE
             I don't know. Innate talent?

They keep playing.

                       CHARLIE
             I haven't met anyone even vaguely
             interesting since we separated.

                       KATE
             Um...stick to the game, okay?

Long beat.

                       CHARLIE
             I've been masturbating like crazy.

                          KATE
             Charlie --

                       CHARLIE
             I miss you.

                          KATE
             Stop it.

                       CHARLIE
             Okay. Fine.

Beat.

                       KATE
             You could've been killed.

                       CHARLIE
                 (confused)
             What?

                       KATE
             Riding your bike -- drunk.
                                                   107.


                    CHARLIE
          But I wasn't.

                    KATE
          But is that really the point?

                    CHARLIE
          What are trying to say?

                     KATE
              (beat)
          I worry about you.

                     CHARLIE
              (laughs)
          Yeah, I can understand that. I used
          to worry about you. But now I know
          you're okay.
              (beat)
          That makes me happy...I mean, it
          fucking sucks that you're better
          off without me but I'm glad you're
          doing well.

No reply from Kate.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Would you move back in if I came to
          meetings?

                    KATE
          You should go for yourself, not to
          make me happy.

                    CHARLIE
          But, would you?

                    KATE
          I'm not moving back in.

That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          Listen, I should go. It's gonna get
          dark soon.

                    CHARLIE
          We can always turn the lights on.

                    KATE
          I don't know...

Beat.
                                                         108.


                    CHARLIE
          So, would you at least...let me
          take you out on a date?

Kate says nothing.

                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Maybe...?

Kate shakes her head.

Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
              (new direction)
          Last question: can we just...play
          one more game?

Kate doesn't answer.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
          It's embarrassing. You've gotta
          give me a chance to redeem myself.
              (soft)
          Please.

Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...

...but she also doesn't say no.

There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.

                                               CUT TO BLACK.

                       THE END

          INT. VAN -- NIGHT
          
          Wall-to-wall surveillance set-up. Two FBI AGENTS: DONALD
          CARRUTHERS 30's and RICHARD MESSNER 30's, man the post,
          staring at video monitors. Both hold telephoto images; shaky,
          long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. Messner
          tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. One is
          labeled "Subject SIDNEY K. SERNA: UNDERBOSS/Sparazza Family."
          
          The other is labeled "Subject VICTOR "BABY BUZZ" PADICHE
          LIEUTENANT/Sparazza Family." Voices begin emitting over the
          van's speakers.

                       You got clicks, anything?
          
                                   PADICHE (V.O.)
                       Nah, nuthin' on my end--

                       --Okay...hang on, I gotta move--
          
          Messner rides a digital console, tweaks frequency.

          ON THE MONITORS: The image pans, follows a figure moving
          behind the mansion's windows, entering a back bedroom.
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this
                       is it, here, okay, so listen to me
                       careful and wait till I'm finished
                       'cuz we got no room for slop.
          
                                     PADICHE (V.O.)
                       I'm here.
          
          Messner adjusts the record level, V-U meters spike, modulate.
          The figure on the monitors paces the room. WE SEE it's Serna.
          
                                                   2.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just
          gotta outta there--
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          --he's doing it then, huh--
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          --yeah, now lemme finish, I was
          eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay
          this thing out, since the information
          might be a little loose--
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          --okay, g'head--
          
                      SERNA
          So what I heard downstairs there is
          that they got a guy, some Swede,
          real badass, supposedly a "specialist"
          and they're bringing him over. Now
          he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm
          thinkin' we jump, do this in the
          next day or so, get to Israel before
          the Swede can, we got chits, y'see?
          We're in a power position. Grab
          him, ransom him back, pick up that
          nut, we're that much closer to having
          our own thing.
          
                      PADICH (V.O.)
          --I see that, yeah, s'smart move,
          for us anyway.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Trust me, we keep our mouths shut,
          go about our thing, play the part,
          nobody suspects us.
              (feedback distorts)
          The old man's on the fade Buzzy,
          fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I
          don't like saying that, but hey, our

                    Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline,
                    yet and before I get to it, one more
                    thing I heard, little curious, should
                    probably bring it up...Primo wants
                    Israel's heart. The actual thing,
                    the organ.
          
          Pause. Feedback. The agents trade looks. Carruthers grabs
          a cellphone, dials, patches a feed for the party on the other
          end to hear.

                    That's not a problem. Are we goin'
                    outta pocket ourselves?

          MONTAGE
          
          Over this entire sequence WE HEAR Agent Locke speaking:
          
          The cylinder of a .44 Magnum is popped, a speed-load dropped
          in, spun and snapped shut-- Porn mags and crossword puzzle
          compendiums are tossed into a carry-on. Morphine and
          adrenaline syringes get spiked and capped-- A collection of
          wigs, fake sideburns and moustaches get laid out, separated--
          
                                                                    19.

                    is made on his life...
          
          Kevlar body armor gets stowed-- An elephant gun gets buffed
          to a high shine-- Vintage Ww11 German Potato-Masher hand-
          grenades are lovingly wrapped in terry cloth towels.
          
                                LOCKE (CONT'D)
                    ...then it is being made by those of
                    the strictest professional caliber...
          
          Torture-tools; curved cutting implements, serrated bone saws,
          skull keys, a portable blowtorch, blackened with burned
          blood...all packed neatly into a duffel bag--
          
                                LOCKE (CONT'D)
                    ...They are cold-blooded, ruthless,
                    and without restraint...and they
                    must not succeed.
          
          A gun is aimed, a trigger pulled..."BOOM"

          FADE UP ON:
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- MORNING
          
          Daybreak. Sunlight streams in, soft suffusion, the color of
          good scotch. PRIMO SPARAZZA, 86, lies on a hospital bed, an
          O2 mask shrouding deep-set, sunken eyes, cataract-grey, gazing
          out at a four-walled world. Someone enters the room, awaiting
          approval to approach...Sparazza, turning, seeing the man,
          summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. The man reaches
          him, kneeling down, ring-kissing reverent, whispering:
          
                                MAN
                    ...he's here now...
          
          Sparazza nods. The man exits. After a moment, the door opens
          again...and another MAN enters, walking slowly toward
          Sparazza's bedside. He sets down his luggage, a black leather
          valise. The travel tags originate in Stockholm:
          
          The Swede has arrived.
          
          FADE TO BLACK
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          Soaring across the pristine deep blue waters of Lake Tahoe.
          Rising, revealing the gaudy, mirrored glass tower of the
          NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO. We slowly DISSOLVE TO:
          
                                                                     20.
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- MORNING
          
          BUDDY ISRAEL, bathrobe, boxers, bags under his eyes. He
          absently shuffles cards, pulling aces as if by touch,
          telepathy. He gazes out at the snow-packed peaks. Behind
          him; post-bacchanalia...the ugly morning after. Prostitutes,
          passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto
          heels, lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays,
          coke-covered tabletops and tipped room service trays. -
          
          Israel, sober now...contemptuous of it all. He starts walking
          around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield.
          His bathrobe brushes over, terrycloth catching one of the
          hooker's wigs, tugging it free. Israel looks down, zooming
          in on her scalp, sees dandruff and scars, gags disgust and
          disdain. He steps, the wigs pulls. He stops and slips the
          bathrobe off, letting it fall rather than pull her wig the
          rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains.
          
          He shuffles, begins dropping Aces on their bodies like dead
          enemy soldiers. One of his bodyguards enters; a bulging,
          slow-witted, ex-bodybuilder by the name of HUGO CROOP.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    D'you talk to'm?
          
                                HUGO
                        (fetching Mylanta
                         from the fridge)
                    I got his machine.
          
          A beat. Israel fidgets, twitches, rubs coke residue from his
          nose and over his gumline
          
                                ISRAEL
                    What'd you say?
          
                                HUGO
                        (gulping Mylanta)
                    I said I got his machine.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    No, what did you say on the machine?
          
                                HUGO
                    I left him a message.
          
                                 ISRAEL
                    I know you left him a message. What
                    did you say!
          
          Hugo looks up, seems confused. Moments pass. Israel, the
          patience of a gorilla, crammed into a canary cage.
          
                                  ISRAEL (CONT'D)

                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    How is it that you can turn a simple
                    conversation into a fucking hedge
                    maze!? This is zero degree of
                    difficulty man!
          
                                  HUGO
                    Okay.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Then why are you still looking at me
                    like I'm asking for the square root
                    of something! What did you say!?
          
          Hugo, still unsure, speaks in spite of it.
          
                                HUGO
                    I said that we were returning his
                    call and you were real concerned,
                    because he sounded real concerned.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Look at that, we didn't have to fill
                    up the whole blackboard after all.
                    Now, do you know anything about that?
          
          Israel wrist-flicks a playing card, it embeds a sofa cushion
          like a ninja throwing star, right next to a beige coat.
          
                                  HUGO
                    About what?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Look at the collar on that coat...
          
          Hugo, wary, walking over, inspecting the coat from a distance.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    What's that look like, that stain?
          
          Hugo edges closer, looks down at the coat, squints.
          
                                HUGO
                    I dunno...Cinnamon roll?
          
                                 ISRAEL
                    Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though.
                    No, Hugo that looks like jizz...
                        (reshuffles, stares)
                    And I'm no forensic expert mind you,
                    but that looks like some fuckhead
                    shot their load on a twelve-thousand
                    dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist?
                    It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's
                    skin jacket.
                        (beat, then)
                    So y'got semen, human ejaculate--

                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (checks watch)
                    --that's been allowed to soak in for
                    what, six, seven hours now? Work
                    it's way into the fabric-fuck'n
                    fibers-- and while you may never see
                    it in a Tide commercial, I think it
                    still safely qualifies as a "tough,
                    deep down stain."
          
          Hugo takes another pull off the Mylanta bottle, moving slowly,
          like most morons do, avoiding eye contact at all cost.
          
                                HUGO
                    I could have it sent out...
          
                                ISRAEL
                    ...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm
                    almost dead certain there's not a
                    fucking laundry detergent or dry
                    cleaning process known to man that
                    can ever return that jacket to its
                    former glory! Some shit, suffice it
                    to say, just don't wash out.
                        (beat, cooling down)
                    Now, the money question...To whom
                    does that stain belong?
          
          Hugo, gameface falling apart...Israel prods him.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, somebody was banging one of
                    these skanks, sans rubber--
                        (beat, assesses girls)
                    -which is terrifying in its own right-
                    pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined
                    the last gift my mother gave me before
                    she died.
                        (snatching up coat)
                    The way I see it, it's the same as
                    if she was dug up, three months dead
                    and it was shot right on her rotting
                    corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled
                    this feels!
          
          Hugo. Long pause.   Big dumb blush.
          
                                HUGO
                    Do you want me to say I did it?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    I was kinda hoping, yeah.
          
                                HUGO
                    Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Only if you really, truly mean it.
          
                                                                      23.
          
          Hugo, swallowing, pressures on. The phone begins to ring.
          
                                HUGO
                    ...I'm sorry...
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
          
                                    HUGO
                    I am.   Yeah.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Without peer?
          
                                HUGO
                    I-- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
          
          Cards dance, Israel's hands moves at lightspeed, he reaches
          into Hugo's shirt front and pulls a playing card out...Joker.
          
                                ISRAEL
                        (showing him the card)
                    No. Be sure. Be resolute.    You stand
                    alone on that summit.
          
          The phone rings. Hugo, wobbly, what-to-do...? Buddy fires
          all fifty-two cards into his face. The beast barely blinks.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    Get the phone, it might be Gill,
                    then get out of my sight.
          
          Hugo, furtive look to the floor, all those scattered cards,
          then, back to the boss, "should I?"
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    No. The cards can stay there. Get
                    The Goddamn Phone.

          He clicks off. Messner occupies the passenger seat, reviewing
          surveillance tape, portable headphones on, mini-DAT player
          in his lap. He listens to the following excerpt:

          Messner pulls the headphones off.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Anything on the Swede?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Only the mention made in that phone
                    call. There's no Swedish hitman of
                    any renown, much less one with a
                    million dollar day rate.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Maybe he's that good. Never been
                    caught, no criminal record.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maybe.
          
          Messner, sets the gear on the floorboard, stretches. He
          turns over photographs of Victor Padiche and Sidney Serna.
          (the same ones that were tacked to the corkboard of the
          surveillance van in the opening)
          
                                MESSNER (CONTD)
                    I tell you, engineering this kind of
                    play against Sparazza, going to the
                    lengths these guys are going
                    to...they're playing some long odds.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    And a very bad gamble.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (re; the passing neon)
                    Well... This is as good a place for
                    it as any I guess.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          CAMERA MOVES PAST, TRACKING THROUGH:
          
          INT. CHOW SHACK BUFFET -- MORNING
          
          Tahoe's "First and Finest" all seasons Buffet. THE CAMERA
          FINDS: A slicker older cat in a Guyabera shirt, mid-fifties,
          spotted skin, sun damaged, pocked with pre-cancerous black.
          We recognize him from the mugshots and surveillance video:
          It's VICTOR PADICHE. Sykes and Watters enter FRAME. Padiche
          stands, greeting them, smiling-cigarette-stained-dentures...
          
                                                                      25.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Girls, wonderful, here, sit.
          
          Watters scoots in right next to Sykes, gets comfy. Sykes
          seems a put off by the proximity, ignores it for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Okay, so...you're here, really nice
                    isn't it? Brisk weather, but nice.
                        (as WAITRESS approaches)
                    Coffee? Anything? I didn't want to
                    order for you.
          
                                WATTERS
                    No, we're cool.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Fabulous.
                        (to Waitress)
                    I'm fine sweetheart, thanks.
                        (beat, back to girls)
                    Okay, so...welcome to the south shore!
                        (big smile, then)
                    So, just jumpin' right in, just in
                    terms of this thing, our thing. I
                    spoke to Lorenzo this morning, he
                    says y'got somethin' more or less
                    put together, plan'a attack and me
                    and my associate Mr. Serna, who I
                    can put on the phone hear, we'd
                    love t'hear it.
          
          Watters and Sykes, non-responsive, staring...
          
                                PADICHE (CONT'D)
                    We ain't askin' ya t'take us through,
                    soup t'nuts or 'nuthin' like that, I
                    jus' like t'hear the broad strokes,
                    y'know, so we can get an idea--
          
          Sykes and Watters look at one another, wordless exchange,
          then;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          Awkward beat, Padiche, head cocked, did I hear that right...?
          
                                PADICHE
                    Wha'?
          
                                SYKES
                    Pussy.
          
                                PADICHE
                        (leaning closer)
                    "Pushy?"
          
                                                                      26.
          
          Watters, shaking her head, correcting him.
          
                                   WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          The old man blanches, doesn't quite understand the--
          
                                   PADICHE
                    --Uh...
          
          Another beat. The girls let him dangle. Watters, lewd sneer,
          looks almost lustfully at Sykes as she says the following;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Israel likes pussy...
          
          Padiche, recovering, nodding, nervous.
          
                                PADICHE
                    ...Oh...uh-huh, yeah--
          
          Sykes squirms under Watters lascivious gaze, but manages:
          
                                SYKES
                    And we like that he likes...
          
          Yet another beat.    Padiche, wanting desperately to contribute.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Pussy?
          
                                   SYKES
                    Correct.
          
          Padiche, big nod going from one girl to the other, he-get's-
          it-but-not-really.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Fabulous.
          
          He extends his hand.   WE TRACK IT ACROSS IN C.U. as it meets
          with a male hand.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- BLACKJACK INN -- MORNING
          
          Dupree and Deeks shaking hands with RUPERT "RIP" REED, mid-
          forties, showbiz-slash-mob attorney, low man on the totem at
          the Las Vegas based legal firm of "Culpepper Brody & Reed"
          
                                REED
                    Yeah, Jack, alright...hey--
                        (shakes Deeks' hand)
                    Nice t'meet you. Rip Reed.
          
                                   DEEKS
                    Pete.
          
                                                                       27.
          
                                REED
                    Okay, good, good, c'mon, c'min.
          
          Reed and Dupree shake.   Reed glances out in the hall before
          closing the door.
          
                                REED (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                        (to Dupree)
                    Where's your third? This was a
                    troika, no?
          
          Dupree, finding a seat, almost under his breath.
          
                                DUPREE
                    He's...fuckin'...he's comin'...
          
          As Elmore appears, Reed almost closes the door on him--
          
                                REED
                        (extending hand)
                    Hey, hey how r'ya, Rip Reed.
          
                                 ELMORE
                    Hollis.   Elmore.
          
          They shake. Dupree shoots a look at Elmore, not pleased.
          Elmore, pissy, leans against the wall, arms crossed.
          
          Reed, wound out, worn thin, half drunk-- his bedspread is
          papered with writs, summons, notaries, etc: Everything to
          make Buddy Israel's return to custody legally binding. He
          sits on the edge of the bed, reaching for a pack of smokes
          on the nightstand, finding a half empty glass of scotch.
          
                                REED
                        (to Deeks)
                    So Jack tells me you're both ex-cops?
          
                                DEEKS
                    Yeah, that's right.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    They worked as swingmen for the Vegas
                    Vice squad--
                        (to Deeks)
                    What? Five, six years?
          
          Reed, digging a cigarette out of his pocket.
          
                                REED
                    Man the stories you guys must tell.
                    I grew up soft myself, private
                    schools, little blazers, you "Talked
                    it out" nobody threw punches, t'this
                    day, never been hit with a fist,
                    Imagine that, huh?
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                    28.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling
                    little faggot-fairy when I smell
                    trouble-- and I don't say this to be
                    self-deprecating, I just don't have
                    much of an opinion about myself, I
                    mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more
                    like you guys, barfighters, big
                    swinging dicks, gettin' it done.
                    Sadly.
                        (lifts his shirt,
                         exposes torso flab)
                    This is it. It's...disgusting.
                        (with a look skyward)
                    Thanks God, dogpile a piss-poor
                    physique with an small cock and
                    hereditary alcoholism! 'preciate it!
                        (beat, to Dupree)
                    Okay, I'm babbling, I do this when I
                    drink, forgive the rants, let's get
                    at it here. This wanted felon fucking
                    prick bastard Buddy Israel and the
                    nearly one million dollar bail bond.
          
          Dupree smiles, pats Reed on the shoulder, don't-sweat-this...
          
                                DUPREE
                    Rip, my right hand to God, we're
                    gonna go in and recover this asshole
                    and everybody's gonna leave the
                    theater grinning. Trust me.
          
                                REED
                    That confidence translates bro,
                    seriously, it does! Out-STANDING!
          
          Reed, white-boy high-five, excruciatingly un-hip. Deeks and
          Elmore literally have to look away. Dupree can barely bear
          it.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    I'm a lawyer, y'know, I need to hear
                    these things, little boosts, helps
                    allay my fears, I pass that piece of
                    mind along to my partners.
                        (beat, then)
                    Alright, so, couple primers for you
                    guys, maybe things we might've looked
                    past that you should know about...His
                    hangers-on, these idiots Israel
                    runs with, they're all "packing heat"
                    "strapped" whatever the phrase is.
                    Point two, Israel likes hookers, so
                    you might run into a harem up there.
                    Point three: He binges between a six-
                    to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine
                    habit that nobody knows about, so he
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                       29.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    and those hookers, will most likely
                    be high. He also drinks, self-
                    medicates, the whole cliche, y'know?
                    The strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch
                    drunk. The seven-layer loser.
                        (beat, exhales)
                    I'm praying he puts up a fight,
                    please, please, please, rape him if
                    possible, I'll-pay-the-extra-whatever--
          
          Nobody knows what to make of Reed, as he giggles, nods,
          smokes, nods, drinks-- he looks at all of them, a sudden
          unexpected wave of enthusiasm seizing him.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    Yeah-yeah-yeah. Fucking hell, this

          Reed begins laughing like a complete fucking loon, like he's
          just lost it completely. It's paralyzingly uncomfortable.
          Then, just like that, he stops, grabs an envelope.

                    dollars.
          
          Reed hands the envelope to a smiling Dupree.

          in front of him: SIR IVY, his steadfast second-in-command:
          The presence of a Pimp, the mien of a Mack.

                    Calm down.
          
          Israel gets up in Ivy's grill. A phone begins to ring.

                    Don't tell me to "calm down" Ivy! I

          Hugo rushes for the phone.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    Look at the attention we're getting.
                    It's all bad...

          Hug hands the phone to Israel, pulling his own cell, dialing.
          Ivy looks around at the collapsed hookers, strewn about the
          place, his face registering the appropriate disgust. Then:
          
                                SIR IVY
                    BEANIE!
          
          Some of the girls start at the sound of Ivy's big Barry White
          baritone. They rise, groggy, burping up last night's
          debauchery. Mascara-smeared, hangover-hindered the girls
          rise as BERNARD "BEANIE" ALFONSE, protector #2, pops in; A
          sumo-sized brother with a diamond-studded smile.
          
                                BEANIE

                    Alright ya'll, that's the call, we
                    had our fun, pack it in, pro-ceed to

          Beanie starts herding hookers, Ivy positions himself at the
          door, pulls a flashroll, fingers hundred dollar bills.
          Israel, phone to his ear, retires to the bedroom for privacy.

          paying the gals as they exit the suite. One YOUNG HOOKER
          bringing up the rear, stumbles in her stripper heels, shaky,
          tries to take another step, slips, trips, falls-- smacks
          face first into a glass coffee table, shattering it.

          The other Hookers; gape jawed, mild shock, mild amusement.
          Beanie plucks the fallen woman up, shakes her off, straightens
          her out, pulls off the offending heels.

                    you lied to me, knowing that I'd
                    find out anyway, I'll never know,

                    There are certain meds, certain
                    intravenous measures that can
                    counteract some of the damage you've

                    Six months now and we're just seeing
                    this?
                        (beat, reading)
                    Did you know that he's has had thirty-
                    six major medical procedures performed
                    on him since 1953?

          Messner, turning the file toward Carruthers, pointing.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    --look at this, look at the work
                    he's had done; nose, three times,
                    eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw-- he's had
                    his jaw done a dozen times.

                    You take every hasbeen actor in
                    Hollywood they haven't been cut this
                    much.
          
          Messner flips to another part of the file.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall-
                    to-wall major felony offenses, murder,
                    extortion, arson, grand larceny--

                    --A paternity suit...I just feel
                    like we're playing catch-up with all
                    this and we shouldn't be.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody
                    shares information anymore, it's
                    become synonymous with job security.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Based on what we had, I thought
                    Sparazza was a mid-level player at
                    best and it turns out he's this mob
                    relic, running the show out west.
          
          Carruthers nods, sips his coffee.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    He's stayed below the radar. You
                    don't kill a hundred and thirty people
                    without knowing how to tip-toe.
          
          Messner flips the file, finds a page paper-clipped with a
          photograph of murder/martyred Federal Agent Freeman Heller.
          
                                MESSNER
                    But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed
                    Heller. Why not go after him, guns
                    blazing' for that one?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Heller was buried in agency lore,
                    anytime an operative failed or was
                    perceived to have failed, Hoover
                    blackballed their memory. Look at
                    Ness.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah, but the Untouchables took down
                    Capone. Heller got shot and killed.
                    The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza
                    walked.
          
          Messner sits back, kills the remainder of his coffee, gazing
          out the window, watching sightseers stream by. Carruthers
          glances at his watch.
          
                                                                      36.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    It's almost five a.m. in D.C. now.
                    Locke said the lawyers from Justice
                    had been in there since three o'clock
                    yesterday afternoon. Israel's manager
                    is acting as his attorney and that's
                    what's holding things up.
          
          The waitress arrives with breakfast, sets it down.
          
                                MESSNER
                    So he has no idea what's about to
                    happen?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No. And I want to be in that room a
                    half second after Mecklen calls to
                    say the deal's done. We've got a
                    sheriff's task force on stand-by.
          
                                MESSNER
                    What about the hotel staff obstructing
                    us. Israel's obviously paid off the
                    management.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Tampering with a witness extraction
                    of this magnitude makes everyone
                    indictable at the federal level.
                        (beat, grins)
                    Trust me, we won't any problems with
                    the hotel staff. You show 'em your
                    ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all
                    caps and it's instant compliance.
                    I've seen in happen a hundred times.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          F.B.I. BADGE AND IDENTIFICATION
          
          It fills the the frame. An O.S. voice explains:

                    your head of security.
          
          A pimply CASINO EMPLOYEE nods, dashing off to find the boss.
          Acosta glances around, takes in the eight-dollar-an-hour
          security, the array of quasi-armed guards...and smiles.
          
                                DEEKS (V.O.)
                    Where'd you get these?
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Guard uniforms, exactly like those we've just seen, worn by
          the Nomad's security staff. Maroon with burnished gold
          buttons and brown piping down the slacks. Three separate
          vestments laid out across the trunk of a rental car.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT -- OFF THE LAKE -- DAY
          
          Dupree and Deeks in an empty parking lot, bundled up in
          windbreakers, battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off
          the lake.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Same place that rents the guard's
                    uniforms. There's a shift change at
                    9am. Graveyard goes home and we can
                    blend in with the day shift coming
                    on.
          
                                DEEKS
                    What about access cards? Pass keys?
          
                                DUPREE
                    We'll have to get our hands on them.
                    There's two separate units; Casino
                    Floor/Count Room Security and General
                    Hotel Security--
                        (annoyed, nods to car)
                    Does he want to hear this or what?
          
          Deeks bangs on the hood of the car.
          
                                DEEKS
                    Hollis!
          
          Elmore steps out, moving slowly to the rear of the car.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Nobody put a gun to your head.
          
          Elmore leans against the bumper, bored.
          
                                ELMORE
                    Yeah, we've been through that.
          
                                                                    38.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Then quit acting like somebody shit
                    in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave
                    us fifty grand.
          
                                ELMORE
                    --Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing
                    here, aren't I?
                        (beat, to both men)
                    Shouldn't that be enough? That I
                    made the trip?
          
                                DUPREE
                    Your attitude sucks.
          
                                ELMORE
                    I been accused of worse.
                        (glancing at uniforms)
                    What do we got...?
          
          Dupree, dubious, does he continue...?   Fine. Fuck it.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Two security levels, the one we're
                    going in under the guise of, hotel
                    security, has restricted access.
                    They're mostly there to monitor the
                    lobby, handle disturbances on the
                    different floors and toss out drunks.
                        (beat)
                    There's a thirty-five member employee
                    rotation going from graveyard to day
                    shift. If we split up, we can blend
                    in and enter unnoticed. Once we're
                    inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
          
                                  ELMORE
                    Then what--
          
          --A Plymouth Barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses.
          The trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end.
          Bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine-gun
          bursts-- Dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying
          thought, cut comically short; "I had that car in high scho--
          
          Deeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a
          fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound.
          One creases Elmore's skull, another blows out Deeks' back,
          fragmenting, claiming three fingers from Elmore's left hand.
          The three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying
          breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that.
          
          Several seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor
          Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun
          and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked,
          pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off
          the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          The Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES
          TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips,
          baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss.
          DARWIN TREMOR climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw
          boss, brains of the outfit. He looks down at the dead men,
          seems saddened by their state. Some remorse maybe? Maybe so.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                        (still pissing)
                    Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean
                    as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht!
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                        (stops singing)
                    Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't
                    vacated yet, s'keep quiet.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass.
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                    ...YOU AIN'T NO CHINESE!
          
          This exchange prompts Jeeves to turn and urinate on Lester.
          Lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on
          his behemoth little brother. Jeeves ignores the hydrant-
          like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back.
          
          Darwin kneels down over the dead Jack Dupree, taking Jack's
          face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his
          own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act.
          
                                DUPREE (DEAD)
                    ...I forgive you Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Shoot, I appreciate that man.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    If I needed your I.D. and your car
                    and me and my brothers were wanted
                    by the law, I woulda killed you to
                    get 'em too.
          
                                  DARWIN TREMOR
                    You woulda?
          
                                DUPREE
                    Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong
                    place at the wrong time. So don't
                    feel so bad dude.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn...alright then.
          
                                DUPREE
                    I don't mind now anyway.

                                                                      40.
          
                                DUPREE (CONT'D)
                    You know, up here in Heaven, it's
                    beautiful. Way better than fuckin'
                    Hawaii or any place like that.
          
          Darwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. In the
          background, Lester and Jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly.
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Really?
          
                                DUPREE
                    I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm
                    gonna get laid by some fine ass angels
                    and then go hang out with Jesus and
                    them.
          
          Darwin wipes his eyes.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Man, that's great.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    I got it made in the shade Amigo.
                    Hey, I'll see you up here some day,
                    don't worry.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    You think so?
          
          Darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as
          though Dupree we're smiling up at him.
          
                                   DUPREE
                    I know so.
          
          Darwin smiles back down   at the corpse, wiping his nose on
          his sleeve. He reaches    down and pulls out Dupree's wallet.
          He spots the bondsman's   license, eyeballs the bail papers:
          He sees the name ROBERT   ISRAEL in bold type. Puts it together.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn Jack...you was after the same
                    sacka shit as us...Small world.
          
          Darwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope
          with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. With his free
          hand he manipulates Dupree's dead mouth one last time.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Don't tell your asshole brothers you
                    know about it, that money is for you
                    old boy.
          
          Darwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead Dupree.
          
                                                                      41.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I appreciate that pard...I wish I
                    coulda been a better friend.
          
          Darwin stands, His eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still
          laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers,
          Jeeves now with a Lenny-like hammerlock on Lester's head.

                    We need t'get over t'that hotel.
          
                                WATTERS (V.O.)
                    We're already here baby.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- MORNING
          
          Watters is once again on her cellphone to Lorenzo.
          
                                WYMAN (O.S.)
                        (on the phone)
                    So everything's cool then?
          
                                WATTERS
                    We sat down with Padiche, he tried
                    to get some details which we wasn't
                    gonna give up, but it's all good.
                    We goin' check Sis in first, 'fore I
                    check in across the street.
          
          Sykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators
          open-- and Israel's Hookers, post-brawl bruised, bloodied
          and barefoot, come staggering out.
          
          They slur insults at the security team, broken heels slung
          over their shoulders, wigs misaligned, miniskirts mangled.
          Sykes trades looks with Watters as if assessing something,
          nodding almost imperceptibly to one another. Watters then
          winks, something sexual there...it gives Sykes the shivers.
          
          The Hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and
          summarily whisked away. Watters joins Sykes. The WOMAN
          behind the counter checking Sykes in, looks up to see Watters.
          
                                 WOMAN
                    Will you be needing a room with two
                    double beds?
          
                                SYKES
                        (quickly)
                    No, we're not together.
          
          Watters, a grin.
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon baby, don't be shy.

                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (to woman)
                    Just one bed please.
                        (beat, to Sykes smiling)
                    Although if we sweat that one up, we
                    goin' need some clean sheets.
                        (As Sykes pulls away)
                    C'mon Girl, you know I'm playing!
          
          Sykes looks uneasily at the counter woman, who keeps her
          eyes locked on the computer in front of her.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (over her shoulder to
                         the departing hookers)
                    ..If ya'll let hoochie like that
                    stay up in here, ya'll must be burning
                    sheets by the ton.
          
          The woman just smiles that monstrously insincere "I'm here
          to help!" smile, offering nothing in response.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    You just goin' grin? Y'ain't goin
                    comment on that, at all? Trampy ass
                    skeezers, doin' damage they ain't
                    even smart enough to see. That don't
                    gall you at all?
                        (beat, closer)
                    Bitches like those are the same ones
                    runnin' feminism right to the brink
                    girl. Bitches like that the reason
                    mafuckas don't take our species
                    seriously. We jus' meat for male
                    consumption, we jus' pieces a'ass
                    and pussy, somethin' pretty in
                    lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.
          
          Sykes, embarrassed, nudging Watters, knock-it-off...
          
                                WATTERS (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bitches like that make me weep for
                    what could be-- if we could all,
                    sisters everywhere, black, white,
                    yellow and brown, put our shit down
                    one time, unified front, the force
                    of the female race, mobilized, moving
                    as one...
          
          The woman, smile severely strained, the pro-feminist diatribe
          falling on decidedly deaf ears. An awkward beat, then;
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm gonna need a mini-bar key too.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                       43.
          
          A mini-bar being opened. A hand reaching in, extracting two
          small bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey and a bottle of seltzer.
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL ROOM -- LOWER FLOOR
          
          The figure crosses the room, pouring the seltzer onto a towel.
          He kneels down, dabbing a spot on the carpet, fresh spill,
          deep red, indelible.. The seltzer doesn't bring it up. The
          stain remains, smeared now but unmistakable...blood.
          
          The figure stands. In the bathroom behind him, we see a body,
          male, late-50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub
          and bled out. The figure walks in, takes a Polaroid, turns
          it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo.
          
          He crosses back into the bedroom. The resulting photo is
          tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops.
          As the figure sits, WE PAN OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          LAZLO SOOT: world class assassin slash master of disguise.
          The slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we
          now see in the mirror. Soot touches up the putty and plastic
          appliances on his face, smoothing, sealing...
          
          He takes up a small micro-cassette recorder, rewinds, pushes
          play. A butler's uniform, steamed and pressed, hangs on the
          door. He takes it down and begins changing into it.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    --Keep calm.
          
          He glances over at the bed. The dead man's voice crackles
          back over the recorder.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I am an employee, I-- I don't know
                    wh-- they don't let me speak to h--
          
                                LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    --Say your name. Then say "How can I
                    be of assistance."
          
          Soot, back to the mirror, buttoning his collar, straightening
          his cuffs, smoothing out the creases.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I don't understand.
          
                                 LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    I didn't ask for your understanding.
                    I asked you to say your name, followed
                    by the phrase "How can I be of
                    assistance."
          
          Beat. Soot looks down at the Silencer-fitted 9mm pistol lying
          on the vanity.
          
                                                                         44.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)   (CONT'D)
                    Last chance.
          
          A pause, then:
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    Thank you.
          
          A muffled gunshot sounds. The recorder abruptly shuts off.
          Soot, gazing at his reflection now, rewinds the recorder,
          replays, listens, gauging the man's vocal patterns-- rough
          Baltic accent, throaty warble, excessive smoke & booze
          exposure, tracheal damage. Tough to match. He rehearses one.
          
                                SOOT
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          He grimaces, grabs cigarettes off the bureau, lights, wails
          smokestack, puffing three at once, bellows-like lungfuls--
          He grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau, strafes the
          back of his throat, pops the tops on the bottles of Jack,
          kills them both, gags, sputters, recovers, adjusts himself.
          Suddenly, the phone begins to ring. Soot stops, stares.
          
          After another ring, he lifts the receiver,
          
                                SOOT (CONT'D)
                        (into phone, cautious)
                    This is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          Hugo Croop's voice booms from the earpiece.
          
                                HUGO

          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- MORNING
          
          Israel, sequestered to his bedroom, lying on a baby-grand
          piano, its legs inexplicably sawed off during the previous
          night's hedonism. In his hands, the de riguer deck of cards,
          restlessly shuffled and reshuffled...Cocaine has been lovingly
          cut and arranged in neat, snortable rows atop the piano.
          
          In the b.g. we see HUGO on the phone to Vitoli/Soot.
          
                                                                    45.

                    They're gonna give on this in the

                                MECKLEN (O.S.)
                    I dunno what to say to you sweetheart,
                    it is what it is.

                    Bullshit it is. I said, about as
                    loud as I could say it, "no jail

          Morris Mecklen, sleepless, sweat rings blossoming armpit to
          waist. He picks at the plate of room service food in front
          of him. A group of Feds and Fed lawyers linger in the b.g.

                    And they're not going give there
                    pally. They're bricking us on that
                    particular issue.
          
          Mecklen glances back over his shoulder, lowering his voice.

                    Baby, I've been co-habitating with
                    these people for the past thirty odd
                    hours and in so doing, have stared
                    into the face of hell. These are the
                    premier prick cocksuckers of all
                    time and I feel beaten by them, I
                    feel bloodied--

          Buddy's rubs his chest-- grimacing-- he lays back on the
          piano, hoists a vial of blow, presses a nostril, does a bump.

          The Feds are signaling Mecklen back into the main room.

          Buddy's head teeters back, bangs on the keys, sour chords,
          thinking...thinking...He takes the deck, firing the cards up
          in a perfect column above his head, snatching one random out
          of the air with his right. He turns it over, looks...Joker.

                    security and have the elevators locked
                    down and stairwells secured. We
                    need to keep Israel sequestered in
                    that penthouse.

                    No, I'm sorry, the penthouse is
                    currently under construction.

          S.A. Gerald Diego, alias Pasquale Acosta, speaking   with "Bill"
          SECURITY SUPERVISOR for the Nomad. Banks of video    monitors
          surround them, displaying the various gaming areas   and VIP
          floors...two of the screens are completely blacked   out.
          
                                ACOSTA
                        (to Bill)
                    Can I speak to you privately?
          
          The Supervisor nods, dismisses his staff, calls after one.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Gary, let's get our personnel up in
                    the catwalk over twelve, that stickman
                    has been acting odd and I don't like
                    the rolls that table has been getting.
          
                                  EMPLOYEE
                    Got it.
          
          Acosta waits for the door to close, leaving only himself and
          the supervisor in the room.
          
                                                                    48.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    It's gotta be tough keeping an eye
                    on everything.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    And everybody, all the time. Yeah,
                    it's a chore.
          
          Acosta laughs, keeps it loose.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So, Bill, if I understand this right,
                    you currently have your penthouse
                    floor under construction?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    That's correct.
          
                                ACOSTA
                        (points to monitors)
                    But with these down, doesn't that
                    pose a major security concern if, as
                    you say, you have to keep an eye on
                    everything at all times?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Well, we were worried about dust and
                    debris from the work being done
                    ruining the cameras, so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    --so you shut them off?
          
          The Supervisor, quick to amend.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Yes, but no-- we have personnel
                    stationed at both ends of that hall,
                    twenty-four hours a day.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    What kind of personnel?
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          types-- bowling buddies, brushcuts and potguts-- they carry
          Colt .380 autos, religiously kept, strictly range-fired.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
                    Right now? A six man security force,
                    plus a member of our Butler staff.
                    So seven men total.
          
          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
                                                                      49.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    You have a butler working that floor?
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot, stepping onto a lower-floor elevator,
          pushing a service cart tucking the 9mm into his waistband.
          
          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
          The Supervisor sputters-- stammers, realizes he just slipped.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Uh-- well, yes, uh just in terms of
                    the men up there now, my team, he's
                    serving lunch and dinner and just
                    doing general upkeep so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So there are no guests staying on
                    that floor?
          
          The Supervisor makes a big show of the headshake "no...."
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    No. None at present.
          
          Acosta grins, takes a step closer.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    C'mon Bill...you've got some Sultan
                    up there, one of your whales, big-
                    spender, likes a lot of space, you
                    cook up this "construction" thing...?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    No, no, no. We've been looking to
                    renovate that area of our hotel for
                    some time now. The security team is
                    only present to preserve floor
                    integrity, due to the roof access.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Is your security team armed?
          
                                 SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Of course.   Yes.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    And who has access to that floor?
          
          The Supervisor...something like suspicion in his eyes. The
          secure "hotline" begins to ring. The Supervisor looks over
          at the phone, then back at Acosta...the unflappable pro.
          
                                                                       50.
          
                                ACOSTA (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bill, listen, I can ask you now and
                    you can answer me, or I can drag you
                    up to San Francisco and depose you
                    in front of a federal judge. Because
                    that's where we're headed here.
          
          Bullshit, but it sounds good.   The Supervisor starts for the
          ringing hotline.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to
                    see your identification again. We're
                    covering some sensitive material
                    here and I need to safeguard myself,
                    I'm sure you can understand.
          
          Acosta, reaching into his coat.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Of course, but if you could just
                    tell me who has access to that floor--
          
          The Supervisor touches a pass key that he wears on a chain
          around his neck as he moves to answer the phone.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    --I hold the sole pass key and
                    personally relieve the shifts myself.
                    Now if I could get your ID we can--
          
          --Acosta, coming out of his coat, fake ID in hand, the
          supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone
          simultaneously-- suddenly a six-inch, spring-loaded stiletto
          blade explodes from Acosta's sleeve, piercing the ID-- pinning
          it to the Supervisor's chest.
          
          A surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from
          his punctured sternum. The blade retracts. The phone sits
          trembling in the Supervisor's hand, --a voice-- Carruther's,
          tinny and barely audible, warbles from the other end-
          
                                VOICE
                        (over phone)
                    Hello? This is Special Agent Donald
                    Carruthers of the FBI, I need an--
          
          Acosta takes the phone from the stunned Supervisor, replacing
          it on the console. The Supervisor, still confused by the
          exchange, wanting to speak, but unsure of what to say...He
          gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Is...that...blood?
          
          Acosta pockets his ID as he yanks the pass key off the
          Supervisor's neck. His natural accent returns.
          
                                                                     51.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Yes it is and right now it's filling
                    your lungs. In less than a minute,
                    you'll asphyxiate and pass out. You
                    shouldn't be feeling any pain now.
          
          The Supervisor's knees begin to buckle, nervous system slowly
          shutting down. Acosta steadies him, easing him to the floor.
          
                                  ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    Close your   eyes. Think of something
                    wonderful.    Don't make this face the
                    last thing   you ever see.
                        (beat,   in Spanish)
                    Heaven may   hold it against you.
          
          The Supervisor, unblinking, an almost childlike clarity there.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    ...Am I really dying...?
          
          Acosta, deadpan.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Bill--

                    Willliam...
                        (pause)
                    We're all dying...
          
          Bill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last
          breath...Acosta checks for a pulse, then drags his body toward
          a service closet. As he passes one of the video monitors...
          
          ...WE SEE ON-SCREEN: The Employee entrance, grave and swing
          shifts on their way out, day shift on it's way in. Mixed in
          with this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous
          best...The Brothers Tremor.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE -- DAY
          
          Darwin, Lester and Jeeves, clad in full security attire,
          standing apart so as not to appear together, heads down,
          hands shoved into their pockets.
          
          Darwin bird-dogs both his brothers, monitoring their movement,
          using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to
          communicate with them. They pass through and punch in,
          signing time sheets. The surrounding security staff oblivious
          to the new faces. The brothers enter the lower floors, moving
          through the hotel's fitness center and indoor pool.
          
          A kid does a cannonball as they pass as we...

          A clouded bog-- coming to-- consciousness, then, retching,
          gagged gasps, throat ablaze with bile, liquid clearing
          convulsed lungs, breath in burning spasms-- not enough air.
          
          EXT. LAKE --DAY
          
          Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a
          start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a
          deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints,
          bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
          
          He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia
          turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three
          digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he
          stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he
          doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of
          his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the
          concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
          
          He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He
          reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He
          turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down,
          the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...
          
                                MESSNER (V.O.)
                    Double homicide, gunshot vics, both
                    of 'em dumped in the lake. That's
                    where the Sheriff's task force is.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. CAR -- DAY
          
          Carruthers and Messner, hectic, speeding through the south
          shore of Lake Tahoe, cellphones pinned to their ears.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (back into his phone)
                    Deputy, have you made any ID's?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                        (cups phone, to Messner)
                    Get a coroner's estimate too.
                        (back into his cell)
                    --Miss, I've been transferred and I
                    was disconnected. No one is answering
                    and I need someone from security to
                    pick up that line. It's urgent.
          
          Messner, nodding as he listens.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Dep-- Deputy, I'm going to put you
                    on speaker, I have Agent Carruthers
                    in the car with me.
                        (beat to Carruthers)
                    You need to hear this.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          Messner clicks over, the deputies voice fills the car.
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY
                    --nd have a pending ID on a Jack
                    Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out
                    of Las Vegas. He was just rolled
                    and printed by our medical examiner.
          
          Messner and Carruthers trade looks.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Was there anything recovered?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    We found a handwritten receipt in
                    his pocket for what looks like uniform
                    rentals. The name and phone number
                    of the rental house wasn't listed,
          
                                MESSNER
                    What kind of uniforms?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    Receipt wasn't specific, the uniforms
                    were just listed as maroon in color.
          
          Carruthers mashes the floorboard, brakes smoke, power swerve,
          slicing the rented Taurus across four lanes of traffic.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Alright, deputy, we'll be there as
                    soon as possible, until we arrive, I
                    need you to limit physical access
                    and restrict movement to and from
                    the crime scene. Clear?
          
          Messner clicks off.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maroon uniforms?
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah. Have you been able to get
                    through to the Nomad's security?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No.
                        (beat, decision)
                    I'm going over there. You take the
                    car from there, get out to the lake.
          
          Carruthers pushes 110mph, barreling toward the Nomad, blowing
          through traffic-- Both men pull out IFB/earpiece apparatus,
          plugging in, checking their signals.
          
                                MESSNER
                    You going up to the Penthouse alone?
          
                                                                    54.
          
          Carruthers pulls a .45 from his holster, driving with his
          knees now, he jacks the slide, checks for a chambered round.
          
                                 CARRUTHERS
                    Yeah.
          
          The slide releases--
          
                                SYKES (V.O.)
                    That's a bad move.

          Sykes, stowing a Glock 9mm, tweaking the earpiece/mic combo
          she's wearing-- getting primped, leather mini-skirt, lace
          garters, thigh-high platform boots; hooker de coutage.
          
                                 WATTERS (O.S.)

                    feedback off that earpiece--
          
          Sykes pulls her earpiece, adjusts something, re-inserts it.
          
                                 SYKES

          Watters adjusts one of the scanners, searching for a signal.

          Sykes checks her reflection, makes sure her holsters aren't
          peeking out, weapons adequately conformed to her curves.

                                                                    56.
          
                                SYKES
                    Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I
                    wish they made this more sheer.
          
          Watters puts her eye to the scope, scans, finds SYKES in
          the crosshairs across the way, adjusting her outfit. Watters
          settles on her, watches...something vaguely creepy about
          this bit of voyeurism. She nuzzles the Barrett close.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Mmmm. I tell you, I snuggle up with
                    big girl here and my pussy start
                    t'drip.
          
          Sykes grimaces.    Watters sees it, smiles to herself.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    ...So you heard from Keith? He still
                    fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned
                    girl?
          
                                SYKES
                    I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for
                    that sorry ass nigga.
          
                                WATTERS
                    He a dog babydoll. He a great dane.
                    I tried to tell y'after ya'll first
                    date. He hit that ass one time, his
                    interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
          
                                SYKES
                    You know I burned all his shit. All
                    that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic,
                    I burned his turntables too. They
                    was like three-thousand brand new.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on
                    some other scrub. We got one another,
                    s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
          
          Sykes says nothing for a moment, Watters just watches her
          through the crosshairs, her finger idly flicking the trigger
          in a strangely perverse gesture. Finally:
          
                                SYKES
                    Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I
                    want you t'tell me straight up, since
                    I got my suspicions and y'know I
                    ain't one t'talk circles...you gay?
          
                                  WATTERS
                    What!?
          
                                SYKES
                    Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
          
                                                                        57.
          
                                 WATTERS
                    Damn!   Why you trippin' like that?
          
                                SYKES
                    --I don't know, I feel like you always
                    pushin' up on me, gettin' close and
                    I love you baby, in every way you
                    can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
          
                                WATTERS
                    I ain't even goin' dignify that.
                    You my road dog. We threw up sets.
                        (beat, lets it sit)
                    Plus you stank.
          
                                SYKES
                        (laughing now)
                    Fuck you.
          
          Watters spots something outside, grabs a pair of binoculars,
          looks down...BINOCULARS P.O.V.: Four obvious CALL GIRLS
          disembarking a taxi, mylar-colored micro-minis, fuck-me heels,
          cheap shoulder bags. They smoke, laugh, chit-chat.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Alright girl, the ho train has
                    arrived. Four of 'em.
          
          Sykes, grabbing her bag, dropping spare clips inside and
          starting for the door.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...I'm on my way out, I'm just gonna
                    hang in the hallway until they start
                    up in the elevators.
          
          Watters loads a red-tipped round into the breach of the Fifty.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Just get in there and do your thing
                    baby...mamma gots you.
          
          SNAP ZOOM ON BULLET as she slams the action forward, loading
          the round WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
          
          ...Dial tones over black.   A phone rings. A voice answers.
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          A reel-to-reel machine activates, begins to record-- A sticker
          on the pick-up spool reads: "PROPERTY OF THE F.B.I."
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot: arriving at the Penthouse level,
          exchanging nods with the security team, pushing his service
          cart out of the elevator and down the hall, through a metal
          detector, which goes off. Vitoli/Soot shrugs, gestures to
          his stainless steel cart. The security team wave him through.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    So how we lookin'?

                    like it's gonna get done.

          Pasquale Acosta: Now wearing the nametag of "Bill" the
          recently deceased Security Supervisor. He buttons his red
          blazer, hanging the penthouse pass key around his neck as he
          moves through the lobby, carrying a small briefcase.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    That's what we're countin' on. What'd
                    they say when you went for specifics?
          
          The Tremor Brothers: Duffel bags straining with the horrible,
          shit inside. They move toward a service elevator, swapping
          pill bottles, downing overdose amounts, repeating "Mein Kampf"
          recitations as they push the elevator's call button.

          Hollis Elmore: Frantically ringing the alley delivery doorbell
          of a local Souvenir Shop-- naked, frozen, delirious, near-
          death, he has dragged himself there.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been

                    that leave us?
          
          Agent Messner: Watching as the bodies of Dupree and Deeks
          are hauled from the lake by Sheriff's personnel. He walks
          the shoreline, searching for clues, on his cellphone, trying
          to reach Security at the Nomad.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)

          Agent Carruthers: Plugging in his headset as he reaches the
          front of the Nomad, leaping out, rushing inside, holstering
          his gun for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    So we gotta get t'Israel pretty quick
                    for this to fly, yeah? I think?
          
          Georgia Sykes; Pulling a small revolver from her garter-
          holster, annoyed, rubbing the chaffed area, reaching the
          elevator, leaning back against the wall, waiting.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Basically-- it'd really be the best
                    thing right now, yeah. Can't give

          Sharice Watters; Her eye going to the rifle-scope...she makes
          subtle adjustments to the targeting-ring-- P.O.V. -- Israel's
          penthouse sits in the crosshairs. We see a figure, just
          beyond the glass...a shimmering shape, moving within.

          A learjet unloading passengers-- The Swede steps down off
          the plane, dressed as we last saw him, carrying the same
          black leather valise. He's accompanied by two Sparazza thugs
          who quickly escort him to an awaiting car.
          
          The Swede looks over, sees Gill at the payphone...The two
          seem to acknowledge one another as the Swede quickly climbs
          into the car and closes the door--

          A door opens-- revealing Vitoli the butler, aka Lazlo Soot,
          standing behind it. He's with one of the SECURITY TEAM
          MEMBERS; waxed mustache, polo-shirt, gut sucked in.

          Mustache nods. Beanie slams the door on him. Soot, inside
          now, scanning, making split- second evaluations-- what's-
          where, who's-where, he picks up voices from the master bedroom--

          suits, wadded up into balls and stuffed into a garment bag.
          He's doing more cocaine, talking to himself, babbling the
          classic addict's "don't-worry-it'll-to-be-alright" monologue.

          Ivy, his menace gone malignant, quietly stepping out of the
          shadows...Israel has no idea that he's been there all along.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (turning back to Ivy)

          Ivy doesn't budge, just stands there, staring hard.
          
                                IVY
                    So what'd Mecklen have to say?
          
          Israel stiffens, board-straight, the guilt goosing him. Ivy
          turns the burners slow.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    They're getting close. It's down to
                    a handful of deal points now.
          
                                IVY
                    But it's all good right?
          
          Israel almost chokes on his own smile, nodding.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    So we're all traveling together,
                    getting sworn, giving our statements--
          
          Israel starts zipping up some of his bags.
          
                                                                       63.

                    out, but-- yeah, it'll probably go
                    something like that.
          
          Ivy unbuttons his coat. A .50 Cal rides in his shoulder-rig.
          Israel averts his eyes. Ivy lets the moment load up...then;
          
                                SIR IVY
                    You believe in loyalty, don'tcha?
                        (pause, then)
                    'Specially the kind of loyalty where
                    an otherwise sensible motherfucker
                    puts his own best interests aside to

          Israel, unnerved now-- spots a small handgun sticking out of
          his bag. He covers it with the bedspread, looking up at Ivy.

          Carruthers, bracing the same Casino Employee Acosta braced
          earlier. College kid, patch-acne, panic-stricken, stammering,
          struggling, a phone stuck to his hand--

          The kid's skittish gaze shifts, locking on a figure moving
          through the lobby.

          Carruthers breaks off, moving for the man in the maroon jacket
          heading toward the elevator. He reaches him, puts a hand on
          his shoulder.
          
                                                                    64.

          Acosta has fully assumed the identity of the murdered security
          supervisor. The pimply kid at counter eyeballs him, confused.
          Acosta steps behind Carruthers, blocking himself from view.

          Elevator doors open to reveal: The Tremor Brothers, vibrating
          at varying speeds, pharmaceutical stares, simultaneously
          sharp and dull. Georgia Sykes stares back, bad vibes trickle
          up her back. She holds a moment. Doesn't board.

          He mimics a blowjob, treating her like the hooker he thinks
          she is. Sykes wants to shoot him in the face. Lester and
          Jeeves oogle her as the doors begin to close.

          Sykes waits a beat, then reaches for the call button to signal
          another car. WE FOLLOW HER FINGER to the "up" button and--

          Messner takes the bag, gawks, can't quite make out the
          contents.

                    shape from the frostbite, but we got
                    a good pull for latents, positive

          CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          A limo arrives, the Swede disembarks, black valise in tow.
          A group of Sparazza henchmen surround him, spiriting him
          toward a nearby stairwell, anxious to avoid the police.
          
          CAM CONTINUES PAN TO REVEAL:
          
          Doc Gill and Hugo, sitting in their car, a little leery at
          the heavy police presence. Hugo takes up his cellphone.
          
                                HUGO
                    Doc, I'm gonna tell 'em we're on our
                    way up, make sure it's cool up there.
                    Is there anything you need?
          
          Gill shakes his head "no" as Hugo dials. Gill retrieves his
          own phone as he climbs out, dialing, moving to the trunk.
          
                                DR. GILL
                        (into his phone, quiet)
                    I'm going up now, give me ten minutes,
                    that should be enough time to prep...
          
          He clicks off, Hugo is completely unaware of the call he
          just made. Gill pops the trunk, removing his medical bag

          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- SAME
          
          The phone rings, Beanie moves to answer it, tossing his balled
          up Versace shirt to Soot/Vitoli.
          
                                BEANIE
                        (looking back)
                    That's a silk blend B, six-hundred
                    and change an s'got vomit and bile

          Soot nods, unfurls a laundry tote, sticks the shirt inside,
          hand moving within the bag--
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (pointing to Israel's
                         soiled jacket)
                    Check the man's calf-skin coat too,
                    he look like he got some cinnamon
                    roll an' shit all over it--
          
          --Beanie, turning, reaching down for the ringing phone when--
          THWAP-- something plunks him hard from behind-- he's knocked
          forward by the force of the impact-- startled-- instinctively
          slapping at that area-- thinking something stung him.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!?
          
          He looks around, alarmed, head on a swivel, hand probing the
          pain, not aware of the blood coursing from that spot,
          streaming down his back...The phone continues to ring.
          
          Then Beanie hears the small metallic warble of something
          rolling around on the floor behind him, gradually settling.
          A sensation overtakes him...and he grows very still with it.
          
          He looks down at his hand for the first time...sees blood
          there, reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered
          hole right above the base of his spine-- small wisps of smoke
          drifting up out of the wound...He turns, numb...and sees
          what looks like a spent shell casing, just ejected, coming
          to rest on the tile...The phone continues to ring.
          
          His eyes track upward to Vitoli the Butler, holding a silenced
          9mm-- aim still held...And that's when it dawns on Beanie...
          ...He's just been shot in the head.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (almost to himself)
                    Aw hell no you ain't just do that...
          
                                                                    69.
          
          Three more soundless shots from the 9mm put a humane end to
          these proceedings-- blowing Beanie's body over a sofa chair.
          His three-hundred plus pound frame slides to an unceremonious
          halt in the remnants of the shattered coffee table.
          
          Israel's calf-skin coat lies near Beanies dead body, a pool
          of blood surrounding it, soaking through and all the while...
          The phone continues to ring.

                    What did you say to Mecklen?
          
          Israel looks from the ringing phone-- to the gun in his bag--
          no good-- Ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    That's probably him now...

                    assume the shit is rhetorical...so
                    assume I already know.
          
          Ivy lets that .50 caliber hang like intimidation itself.
          Israel looks over at the ringing phone, then back at Ivy.
          He slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket,
          begins shuffling at lightspeed, firing them across his body,
          left to right, right to left.

          He does, snatching a card cold from the deck, turning it to
          Ivy.

                                CARRUTHERS
                    How long have you worked here?
                        (beat)
                    Bill.
          
          A long, drawn silence...then, static emits from Bill/Acosta's
          belt-- his walkie-talkie was working all along. Jig's up.
          
          Acosta spins back-- spring-loaded blade firing from his sleeve--
          Carruthers clears his holster-- Acosta closes the gap-- blade
          flashing, passing through Carruthers' hand, slashing tendons,
          shearing bone, hot butter.--
          
          Carruthers screams-- grip gone, gun tumbling-- instinct kicks--
          his good left hand hauls the .45 out of mid-air, clutches,
          squeezes-- BLAM! Acosta's abdomen eats the blast, burps
          blood-- Carruthers, a severed hand tucked under his chin,
          held in place-- he extends, pulls, fires again-- Ricochets
          clip overhead fluorescents, fixtures catch strays-- shatter--
          glass filament explodes-- razor slivers rain down.
          
          Acosta, struck, slumping-- a silver automatic appearing from
          his other sleeve, trigger finding finger just as the last of
          the lights flicker and die-- A beat sustained-- just hard
          breathing and fluid hitting the floor-- Everything goes stiff--
          
          --the two take silent aim in the pitch black and fire
          simultaneously, blazing away-- emptying their weapons into
          each other from inside three feet-- Gunblasts illuminate
          ghoulish features, muted screams covered in gore...

          Georgia Sykes, concerned, finger to her ear, picking up
          something off her IFB earpiece: Muted gunshots, static-
          scrambled ...it's the sound of Carruthers and Acosta, ending
          one another's lives in the lift below...

                    No, but that definitely sounds like
                    shots and I don't where it's comin'

                    --I thought we had secure frequency.

                    goin' off right now.
          
          Watters hears something crackle over one of the scanners...
          a transmission to Nomad security staff...
          
                                WATTERS

          Sykes looks up to see the elevator has reached her floor.
          
                                SYKES
                    What's wrong?
          
                                WATTERS
                    Security's locking down the elevators.
          
          Sykes looks at the elevator doors in front of her as we...

          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          The Tremor Brothers, waiting arrival on the penthouse, armed
          to the teeth, each one tethered with an array of pistols,
          rifles, knives, hatchets, hacksaws; the tools of their trade;
          to be implemented in the most godless manner imaginable.
          
          Muzak drifts in over the speakers, when suddenly the car
          lurches, cables catch, brake boxes shriek and the elevator
          car comes to abrupt stop. The Brothers exchange looks as
          power is cut and they are plunged into darkness...An emergency
          recording sounds from the elevator's ceiling speaker.
          
                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Please remain calm...Elevator service
                    has been temporarily suspended and
                    will resume momentarily...
          
          The recording defaults into a maddening loop...then, the
          sounds of someone unzipping a bag in the dark, hands moving
          objects around, metal clanks off metal as the bag is rummaged.
          A brilliant flash, hot white to iridescent red as a road
          flare is struck, showering Darwin Tremor with a deluge of
          sparks as he holds it aloft.
          
                                                                    74.

                    Les' get at it then.
          
          Lester and Jeeves, effortless aplomb; the speed and dexterity
          of a seasoned pit-crew. Lester pulls a torque wrench from
          the bag, pops the panel bolts on the elevator's power box
          and strips the electrical wiring in seconds--
          
          Jeeves removes a gas-powered generator from their Mary Poppins-
          like carry-all carpet bag. He primes the pump, yanks it to
          a sputtering start and feeds the AC lead to his brother.
          Lester takes it, locates the service override conduit and
          ties in. Darwin admires this deft display of skill from his
          idiot brethren. As the elevator's power cycles back on we...

          INT. BATHROOM -- DAY
          
          Light switch flipped on, revealing the shrunken, shriveled,
          fetal-like form that is Hollis Elmore being carried by MARGIE
          TURLOCK, 63, part-time RN, full-time souvenir shop owner. A
          substantial, tank of a woman, Margie manhandles Elmore,
          dropping him into a lukewarm bath, brimming with grey water.
          
                                 MARGIE
                    Okay sweetie, now I'm a registered
                    nurse and this was my bath not a
                    half hour ago, so it ain't as hot as
                    it could be, but we're gonna get you
                    all toasty warm in no time--
                        (beat, to boy)
                    Warren, Warren-- go on an' get grandma
                    her hot blanket and her heating bag,
                    the one in there under the sink in
                    my bathroom.
          
          Warren sniffs, licks lovingly on an ice cream sandwich, but
          never bites it.
          
                                   WARREN
                    Slower Nana.     Talk slooooooeerrrrr.
          
          Margie indulges her grandson, no end.
          
                                MARGIE
                    Okay Shug...Grandma needs you to go
                    in--
          
          --Warren begins to smile, a snarl of misshapen yellow teeth,
          smeared with chocolate, bracketed by chrome-colored braces.
          
                                MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Oh, you little foxy, trying to fool

                        (beat)
                    Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big
                    helper boy now, go on an' get those
                    things and grandma'll rub your feet!

                    My karate feet? My crazy Karate
                    kick feet!!
          
          Warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins
          hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great,
          disturbing ferocity. Margie cackles at this.
          
                                MARGIE
                    You little angel-butt! Grandma'll
                    rub those feet forever!
          
          Elmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this
          display with increasing dread. He scans the sink basin--
          sees it lined with anti-depressants; Ritalin, Thorazine, etc
          Warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh you silly-sil! Never mind,
                    Grandma'll get it!
          
          Margie marches off and Warren immediately rushes over to
          the tub, placing himself directly over the inert Elmore and
          assuming a martial arts stance. He opens his mouth to speak
          and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub.
          
                                WARREN
                        (barking out)
                    Bow to your opponent!
          
          Warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically
          delivering a "Kata" of punches and kicks...violently and
          expertly snapped within millimeters of Elmore's face. Elmore,
          helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror
          as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with
          perspiration, works himself into a furious lather.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (trying to speak)
                    Pl-- kid, st-- stop...
          
          Elmore holds up his stump   of a hand,   pinky wagging in pathetic
          plea-- no use-- Warren is   in a state   of unhinged, near-animal
          frenzy-- his eyes wild, a   small, yet   prominent erection
          beginning to poke through   his karate   gee...
          
          Margie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson.    He
          squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. She     clouts
          him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him,    hauling
          him out of the bathroom. He bleats like a butchered     sheep.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          Elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head,
          gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the
          television: A Reporter, lakeside, via live feed...standing
          in the same parking lot where Deeks and Dupree were killed.

                        (beat)
                    So if you think I'mma let your lil'
                    punk-ass, with the dirt I've done
                    for you, in the eleventh hour, sell
                    me off like some fucking field nigger,
                    hand me up to the Feds like y'last
                    chip, then you done gone straight
                    out-your-motherfucking MIND!
          
                                ISRAEL
                        (nodding to phone)
                    That's Mecklen. The deal's closing.
                    I can pick that phone up and I can
                    work this out.

                                                                       78.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (beat, for ffect)
                    You'll walk with me.
          
          Israel readies the playing card behind his back, slips it
          between his index and middle finger-- Ivy shakes his head.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    All that slight a'hand you can do
                    and you still ain't never learned to
                    lie right--
          
          --Israel steps hard, slinging the Ace sidearm, sailing it
          toward Ivy, surgical strike, right eye, blood bursting at
          his browline-- Ivy goes down in a heap.
          
                                SIR IVY (CONT'D)
                        (enraged)
                    MOTHERFUCK! MOTHERFUCKER!
          
          Ivy, doubled over-- he drags the .50 cal from its holster
          and lets fly-- FIRING. Big bore rounds rip right through
          the wall, punching dinner-plate sized holes in the plaster.
          Israel goes to the ground as Ivy, bleeding, blazes away--
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- ANTEROOM -- SAME
          
          --Soot takes cover as bullets whistle by-- he tucks the 9mm
          away just as the doors to the suite are blitzed and the
          security team stumbles in, guns drawn, grouped tight--
          
                                SECURITY TEAM
                        (in unison)
                    DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!
          
          They assume quasi-combat stances; six idiots, crab-crawling
          their way across the room. Soot stays prone, plays scared,
          realizes that his rubber appliance nose has come loose, tries
          to adjust it-- can't, has to hide his face, burying it in
          his sleeve, wiping more make-up off in the process--
          
          Mustache is on point, pistol trained.    He spots Soot cowering.
          
                                 MUSTACHE
                        (to Soot)
                    Are you hit?
          
          Soot shakes his head a vigorous "no" as Mustache and his men
          turn their attention to the bedroom.
          
                                 MUSTACHE (CONT'D)
                        (calling out)
                    Mr. Israel!?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    IN HERE!
          
                                                                       79.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    Are you hurt sir!?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Ivy's trying to kill me!
          
                                SIR IVY
                    FUCK YOU!
          
                                ISRAEL
                    GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
          
          Mustache and his men round the corner into the master bedroom.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- SAME
          
          Ivy, down on one knee, depth perception shot, trying to
          reload, bullets slipping through blood-slicked fingers--
          Israel lies on the floor behind the bed, breathless, chest
          heaving, frantically trying to pull the small automatic pistol
          out of his overnight bag.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                        (advancing on Ivy)
                    Drop-that-gun-right-now!
          
          One of the bodyguards spots the body of Beanie, lying dead
          in the remnants of the coffee table.
          
                                SECURITY MEMBER #1
                    Jesus, he got Beanie...
                        (back to Mustache)
                    He shot Beanie!
          
                                ISRAEL
                    What?
          
          Ivy hears this, let's the gun slide from his hand, standing,
          eye swollen to a bleeding slit.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    GET ON THE GROUND!
          
          Ivy, looking past them, seeing Beanie's lifeless body, laying
          there. Israel peers out, sees the same thing.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          Two of the bodyguards rush to Beanie, bending over his body,
          checking for vitals. Ivy, suspended in the doorway, stunned.
          One of the security team looks back; no good...he's gone.
          Just then, the phone stops ringing.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (looking up at Ivy)
                    ...you just murdered Beanie...
          
                                                                    80.
          
          Ivy, shocked, dismayed. Israel, starting to see his sweetheart
          deal with the Feds go up in smoke. He immediately mobilizes.
          
                                      ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                              (to Mustache)
                       Hey!
                           (pointing to Ivy)
                       Get him out-- muscle him if you have
                       to. Take him down the quietly, use
                       the service exit. Then get back up
                       here and we'll handle the rest of
                       this.
                           (off Mustache's look)
                       What? Is there somebody else in
                       there?
          
          Soot, from the other room, careful to keep his face concealed.
          
                                      VITOLI
                       Eees Vitoli.
          
          Israel, a grimace...two too many people involved. Israel
          nods, thinking, does a bump of coke, right out in the open.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                           (to security)
                       Avert your eyes gents, y'didn't see
                       that.
                           (beat, rolls neck)
                       Okay Vitoli, listen these last few
                       minutes make you a material witness,
                       do you understand what that means?
          
                                   VITOLI
                       ...How can I be of assistance...
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       You do know what that means!
                       Tremendous, that's the attitude.
                           (beat, clutching chest)
                       Alright, Vitoli, hang tight for half
                       a tic, we've got a special sort of
                       "clean-up" we gotta do here, alright?
          
          Soot nods.
          
                                   ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                           (to Mustache)
                       What's he doing, is he getting this?
          
          Mustache, glancing over at Soot, seeing him nod.
          
                                   MUSTACHE
                       Yeah, he's nodding.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       Good. Now Move.
          
                                                                       81.
          
          Mustache and his men brace Ivy, taking advantage of his
          disorientation and dismay and swiftly escorting him out.
          
          EXT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          They amass around the elevator, taking care to double handcuff
          Ivy now. Mustache pushes the call button. It fails to light.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          Choked with generator and road flare smoke, lit like hell
          itself. The Tremors stand at arms, shrouded in a miasmic
          mung of horribly toxic fumes, filling their lungs with it.
          
          CUT BACK TO:
          
          INT. HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Mustache hits the call button again, still nothing.   Yet
          one of the lifts appears to be ascending
          
                                SECURITY TEAM
                    Wait...one of 'em looks like it's on
                    its way up...
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    What about the other four?   Are they
                    out?
          
          He keeps hitting the call button, but it won't light.
          
                                MUSTACHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    The hell is going on...
          
                                WATTERS (V.O.)

          INT. HALLWAY -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME
          
          Sykes, trying to pry the elevator doors open.
          
                                SYKES
                    It ain't dead! Quit saying that
                    shit!
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME
          
          Watters pours herself a glass of Chablis from the mini-bar.
          
                                                                       82.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes comin'
                    out that suite. S'probably where
                    you heard that shootin' earlier,
                    somebody jus' downed Israel. He
                    dead, our play is dead.
          
          Sykes, getting some separation on the elevator doors, pulling
          her 9mm, using it like a crowbar.
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it
                    for a lil' bit, play some craps.
                        (beat, probing)
                    ...Maybe spend the night?
          
          Sykes, struggling, when the doors suddenly retract on their
          own...She's staggered by what she sees in the elevator,
          tripping back, heels catching, dumping her on her ass--
          
                                SYKES
                        (just above whisper)
                    ...oh...damn...
          
          She sits up, stupefied...cordite and pistol smoke drift out
          of the open elevator doors like a funeral dirge. The sound
          of a bone-saw emanates from within.
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR
          
          Carruthers and Acosta...wartorn, shot to hell, post-battle
          standoff, just staring, weapons emptied, bodies bullet-
          punctured, leaking life...both are breathing, but just barely.
          
                                WATTERS (OVER HEADSET)
                    What is it...?
          
          Filament and glass dust cover everything. Blood streams in
          steaming fissures, floating spent shell casings and
          fluorescent shards cover the floor of the car.
          
          Acosta, clinging to life itself, clutching the whirring bone
          saw, trying in vain to reach Carruthers. Sykes wades forward,
          wary, Glock vise-gripped.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...Shhhhhhit...girl, there's these
                    two dudes, just sittin' here in this
                    elevator, all shot up...
          
                                WATTERS
                    What?
          
                                                                       83.

                        (beat, looking around)
                    They musta been beefin' big time
                    with one another, cuz this shit, got
                    way past words, whatever it was.
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...What are they doin' right now...?
          
          Sykes, glancing from Carruthers to Acosta. A beat.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Right now?
                        (beat)
                    ...Dying.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. "LAKEY'S SOUVENIR SHOPPE" -- KITCHENETTE -- DAY
          
          Elmore, seated, wrapped in quilts and heated blankets,
          shivering horribly, lips blackened, flexing brittle fingers
          on his good hand, trying to restore feeling, teeth clattering
          like ten thousand tea cups. Margie Turlock enters, arms
          loaded down, grandson Warren hot on her heels, a set of
          Nunchukas under his arm...
          
          ...Elmore, palpable hatred, pure bile for the boy.
          
          Margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in
          front of Elmore; tourist-themed hats & sweatsuits from the
          shop, a pair of thermals, a collection of pill bottles and
          what appears to be an old Vietnam-era ammo box.
          
                                MARGIE
                    So them fellas were your friends
                    then? The ones that was shot and
                    tossed into the lake? Were they police
                    officers too?
          
          Elmore nods, rifling the pile in front of him, going for the
          pills. Margie pulls a pot of coffee off the stove, pours a
          mug. Sets it down in front of him.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                        (motioning to pills)
                    Them was left over from my
                    hysterectomy, so they're a few years
                    old, might be outta date.
          
          Elmore eyes the labels; Vicodin, Vioxx...morphine-based.
          Nice...Just numb it all.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    You sure you don't want me to call
                    an ambulance honey?
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                    84.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's crazy you not going
                    in...y'got what looks like hypothermia
                    and real bad frostbite. They could
                    wind up amputatin' if y'don't get it
                    treated.
          
          Warren sits in the chair next to Elmore and begins mimicking
          him, shaking epileptically, doing his doofus bit, tucking
          three fingers away, waving a stump, belly-laughing...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Warren! Now you go and practice
                    your nunchucks now, leave us be for
                    a bit Shug.
          
          Warren scowls, getting up, in super-slow motion, making sounds
          with his mouth as he stands, robotic whirs, buzzes, clicks--
          Margie chuckles at her grandson, she can't help it--
          
          Then, in a blur, Warren snaps, abruptly slamming the nunchakas
          on the table, the rebounding portion of the weapon almost
          hitting Elmore in the face. He bolts the room before Grandma
          can scold him, his titters echoing off like taunts...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    ...M'sorry about that boy, his momma
                    abandoned him going on a year now,
                    his daddy, my boy Dale-- Gulf War
                    vet, s'over in the Reno-Washoe
                    Correctional facility-- got some
                    "clarity" issues. He did some home
                    invasion sodomy-torture type stuff,
                    wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself
                    consecutive life terms-- shipped off
                    to Soledad there in California.
                        (beat, scribbles
                         something down)
                    --reminds me, I got that care package
                    I need to send off--
                        (beat, continues lament)
                    Anyhoo, m'husband Bill took the
                    coward's route, n'committed suicide
                    by hangin' 'bout nine months back.
                    Ever since then, little Boogie there's
                    been the man'a the house!
                        (beat, gnarled grin)
                    And we make a darn cute couple I
                    think!
          
          Margie, cackling again-- the facade of sanity showing serious
          signs of strain...Elmore pulls the ammo box across the table.
          Stenciled on the side: "177th Airborne Division -- Charlie
          Company - Reckon" He cracks the lid.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't think that's been opened
                    since my husband died.
          
                                                                    85.
          
          Inside, army memorabilia and bric-a-brac; patches, service-
          tags, dog-earred b&w polaroids, ancient titty mags, (which
          make Margie horribly uncomfortable) Saigon bottled beer and
          most importantly, a .357 Colt Python.
          
          Elmore lifts it, looks it over, feels the heft, drops the
          chamber-- it's loaded. He sifts some more, palms loose bullets
          at the bottom of the box. He cracks a blackened grin, rolling
          the pistol's chamber and snapping it shut as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          A padlock being locked and secured.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY
          
          Elevators and access doors locked down indefinitely. Casino
          and hotel patrons file out in less than orderly fashion.
          Craps players, pissed that their "hot streaks" have been cut
          short, harangue police and sheriff's personnel in passing.
          Barflys and blackjack habituates, accustomed to staying in
          one spot for months on end, have to be manually removed.
          
          The four call girls, trying to argue their way past security
          and onto one of the elevators, realizing they're not getting
          anywhere near the Penthouse level. Messner coordinates the
          Nomad's exodus, continually adjusting his earpiece, trying
          to contact Carruthers, two agents flank him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                         (to agent)
                    I want you to locate Agent Carruthers
                    now.
                         (beat, to another
                          agent)
                    The guests that aren't able to leave
                    need to be confined to their suites.
                    And under no circumstances are they
                    to venture out, for any reason. Have
                    the staff make calls to that effect.
          
          The pimply Casino Employee is at the center of an intensive
          on-spot interrogation being conducted by a group of agents.
          Messner arrives, stares at the kid.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    This him?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                        (nodding, then to kid)
                    Alright Ricky, I want you to explain
                    to Agent Messner exactly what
                    happened and do it slowly please.
          
          The kid, head bobbing, gnawing fingernails, cuticles mangled.
          
                                                                      86.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, ye-- I-- uh, there were,
                    earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
          
                                MESSNER
                    --Agent Carruthers. Do you know where
                    is he now?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He uh-- he asked about-- I'm-- he
                    wanted to know whic-- what floor
                    security was on, then I saw him get
                    on the elevator with the other agent.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (quick, thrown)
                    Wait a minute, what other agent?
                        (beat, to others)
                    What other agent?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    I have no idea. It wasn't anybody
                    from our office.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He said he was from San Francisco.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Did he give you his name?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, uh-- it was Spanish-somethin'
                    Garcia, or Diego, uh--
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to other agents)
                    --run both those names through the
                    D.C. database. Call San Francisco,
                    see if they've got anybody in the
                    field doing collateral inquiries for--
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    --he was wearing one of our jackets.
          
          Messner stops cold.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Who?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    The other agent. He said he was here
                    to do an inspection and later, when
                    he got on the elevator with the other
                    guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing
                    one of our security jackets...
          
          Messner turns, bores in on the kid, no more bullshit now.
          
                                                                     87.
          
                                MESSNER
                    This man wearing the jacket identified
                    himself as an Federal agent?
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Uh, yeah.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    You're sure?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, he had the badge and everything.
                    It said "FBI" on it.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And when you saw him later, he was
                    wearing one of your security jackets--
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And that didn't seem odd to you?
          
          The kid glances around, oops-- my mistake-- tries to amend.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    I-- I mean, I thought they gave it
                    to him so he cou--
          
          Messner turns on his heels, the other agents tag along.
          
                                 MESSNER
                        (addressing others)
                    We may have a man posing as one of
                    us. Get a tactical team assembled.
                    We need to get to the penthouse level
                    immediately.
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    We'll have to power the elevators
                    back up.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    Do it.
          
          As they move past the group of call girls, still arguing
          with security as we...
          
                                                             ...CUT TO:

          Israel, sickly, face bloodless, sitting down on a couch,
          setting the small handgun down on the table next to him. He
          digs at his chest now, in considerable pain, rotating his
          arm around, trying to rouse it.
          
                                                                       88.

                    Fucking things falling asleep...
          
          Israel gazes at Beanie's body, trying to figure out an
          appropriate course of action.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (over his shoulder)
                    Vitoli, just sit tight for a second,
                    I gotta make a phone call, figure
                    this out...
          
          He takes out his cellphone, dialing Morris Mecklen. Soot
          appears behind him, easing the 9mm out of his waistband and
          resuming his stalk...ever...so...slowly.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Israel's security crew, surrounding a still-stunned Sir Ivy,
          waiting on the lift. One of the elevators approaches. The
          rest appear to be down.
          
                                BODYGUARD #1
                    One of 'em on it's way up. This
                    doesn't make any sense, what's wrong
                    with the rest of 'em?
          
          Suddenly, the stairwell doors are flung open, revealing Hugo
          and Gill. All guns whip simultaneously to that spot.
          
                                HUGO

          used to dispatch "Bill" and hack Carruthers digits off has
          retracted back into his sleeve.

          CAMERA MOVES PAST THEM, DOWN ELEVATOR SHAFT TO:
          
          SYKES -- Pulling extra clips from her handbag, securing them
          under her garter belt, dumping her heels in favor of hose.
          
          ACOSTA -- Pant leg lifted, moving panther-quiet, tortoise-
          slow, unfastening the snap on his ankle-holster.
          
          c
          CARRUTHERS -- Near death, eyes locked on Acosta, his mortal
           ombatant, trying desperately to reach his own ankle holster.
          
          MESSNER -- Watching as his team moves into place around the
          e
           levator. Checking his own piece, flicking off the safety.
          
          CAMERA MOVES OUT THE WINDOW AND UP TO:
          
          WATTERS -- In the Hotel window across the way, sniper-rifle
          s
           nug to her shoulder, eye on the scope, waiting for the word.
          
          CAMERA MOVES THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE UP TO AND INSIDE EARPIECE
          
          Inside the earpiece at 10000x normal magnification; micro-
          sound condensers and circuits the size of skyscrapers. Then,
          a voice makes the landscape tremble, like the trump of God:
          
                                SYKES
                    Bring it.
          
          THE CAMERA SUDDENLY REVERSES PATH
          
                                                                       95.
          
          Back out of the earpiece, down through the scope, over the
          barrel of the rifle...BOOM...A .50 caliber bullet is birthed.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELS BACK TO:
          
          The fourteenth floor window of the Nomad detonates with
          concussive ferocity-- creating a hailstorm of shattered glass
          that sweeps the length of the hallway, engulfing cops and
          feds whole.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Another round tears in after it, exploding a gilded ceiling
          stanchion, sparking off the rebar, tripping the sprinkler
          system, dousing the corridor-- everybody runs for cover.
          
          One of the AGENTS, wounded, summons another elevator.
          Messner, undeterred, advances on the elevator containing
          Sykes and Carruthers.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELING BACK
          
          Sykes, Glock ready to rock, about to move. Acosta, pulling
          a pistol from his ankle-rig, preparing to backshoot Sykes.
          
          CAMERA ASCENDS BACK UP THROUGH SHAFT
          
          Chaos. Carnage. Full blown bloodbath. Heavily-armed men on
          an overkill override. Mustache and Co., waging close quarters
          warfare with the Brothers Tremor. Bullets blaze, bodies
          drop, everything burns--
          
          CAMERA CONTINUES PAST SCENE TO:
          
          Soot, shooting Hugo several times-- Hugo falling back,
          confused by the abrupt pain, baffled by the appearance of
          blood. Gill, overtop of Israel, trying to force feed him
          nitro-glycerin tablets. Buddy goes into full cardiac arrest.
          
          Disparate sounds collide now, swell to a great tumult-- an
          incomprehensible crescendo of explosions and chainsaws and
          gunshots and screams as we--
          
          CUT TO BLACK
          
          ...nothing...complete and utter silence...
          
          SLOW FADE UP ON:
          
          Primo Sparazza...sitting in that hospital bed...waiting.

          The Swede...sitting on a sofa in his suite with Sparazza's
          men...waiting.

          HARD CUT UP ON:
          
          All of it happening at lightspeed. Watters, reloading,
          watching as leaden contrails of gunsmoke pour from the
          pulverized fourteenth floor. She resumes her assault.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Messner, a few feet from the car containing Sykes. More
          sniper fire rakes the hallway. Another elevator arrives,
          opens...call girls inside. They snuck up somehow, past
          security... The gunplay gets them spooked, scared-- they
          scramble from the car-- cops and feds try to stuff them back
          inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down.
          
          One of the girls catches a hard ricochet, wig leaping off
          her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull-- she
          crumbles, instant casualty. Messner hardly notices, moving
          instead toward the other elevator car.
          
                                MESSNER
                    THIS IS THE FBI! THROW YOUR WEAPON
                    OUT! SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!
          
                                SYKES
                        (whispering into IFB)
                    Are these feds fake or for real girl!
          
          Carruthers, pawing feebly at her, moaning-- trying to warn
          her-- she shrugs him off.
          
                                WATTERS
                        (yelling)
                    I DON'T KNOW!
          
                                SYKES
                    Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep
                    these mafuckas off my as--
          
          BANG-- Sykes squeals, spins back, feels numbness spread over
          her legs and lower trunk, knows she's been shot.
          
                                                                       97.
          
                                   SYKES (CONT'D)
                           (panic, into her IFB)
                       We're out girl! I'm shot! I'M SHOT!--
          
          ACOSTA fires again, bullet ripping through her studded
          bustier, gouging kevlar, nicking ribcage-- embedding into
          the IFB receiver on her hip, ruining it. Sykes falters--
          tries to raise her gun--
          
          Acosta raises his aim to her head, about to deliver the coup
          de grace-- Messner appears now, sees Acosta, sights him when--
          
          BLAM!BLAM!    BLAM!!
          
          Acosta's chest explodes, he slumps, the gun sliding away--
          Messner swings wide on the car to reveal:
          
          Carruthers, smoking gun, trembling aim, exposed ankle
          holster...empty. Sykes, kevlar burning, smashed round still
          hot, she tries to pull her vest off, finds her newly paralyzed
          arm uncooperative. Messner, advancing now, keeping an eye
          on his partner as he moves toward the car.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       LADY, SHOW ME YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW!
          
                                   SYKES
                       I NEED MY HANDS MOTHERFUCKER! I'M
                       HIT! KILL ME OR LET ME BE!
          
          Messner enters the elevator, rushes to the doomed Carruthers.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       How bad?
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Mortal.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       No.
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Yeah.
          
          Messner takes his partner under the arms, lugging him into
          the open hallway, stripping off his shirt. Carruthers severed
          hand nearly falls away from the rest of his arm.
          
          Acosta spits blood from the lungs-- his breathing now a bog
          of pinched snorts and gurgles.
          
                                   MESSNER
                           (re: Acosta, yelling
                            to the others)
                       SECURE THIS SUSPECT!
          
          TWO FEDS enter to remove Acosta from the car-- he lets out a
          guttural yelp as they hoist him-- real pain or playing possum,
          
                                                                       98.
          
          impossible to tell...As his legs clear the elevator doors,
          they slowly close on the wounded Sykes.
          
          Messner, tries to prevent them from closing, can't-- gazes
          up at the digital counter as the elevator continues its ascent
          to the Penthouse level...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Sykes, riding up, wounded, vulnerable, trying to reach the
          control panel to stop the car. She keys her now useless IFB.
          
                                SYKES
                        (into IFB)
                    Girl, I'm inside, I'm on my way up--
                    this elevator is going to the
                    Penthouse-- can you hear me--? Baby,
                    can you hear me--
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME
          
          --Watters, panicked, pulling the Barrett up off its tri-pod,
          hitting the hallway, double-timing to the stairwell...She
          has no idea that she's lost radio contact with Watters.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Sit tight if you can hear me Girl!
                    I can't do shit for you from here.
                    I'm moving down for a sightline!

          INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Plaster and debris everywhere, sprinklers tripped, most of
          Mustache's team shot, shredded or burnt to a crisp. Pieces
          of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze.
          Mustache and Darwin play duck and cover, exchanging fire.
          Jeeves, out of grenades, sledgehammer swinging, crushing
          wall studs, scattering remaining security team members.
          
          Ivy, sheltered, having survived the opening salvos, gets
          ahold of a gun from a chainsaw-shorn former security member;
          Lester sees Ivy arming himself, blitzes him-- chainsaw
          snarling, revved out, sending fantails of gristle and chipped
          bone everywhere. Less than fifteen feet separate them.
          
          Ivy fires, shots deflected off the blade's teeth, seconds
          from getting gutted-- he adjusts his aim high, emptying the
          gun into Lester's chest, bullets blazing haywire, blowing
          out between Lester's shoulders, stopping a hard charge cold.
          
                                                                       99.
          
          Lester, lopsided, bullet-dazed, drools blood...then dies.
          Ivy dumps his clip, searches for another-- the chainsaw falls,
          stalls.
          
          Jeeves, hefting the sledgehammer like a hayseed John Henry,
          looks over as his older brother's life come to an end. He
          reacts badly.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    LESTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
          
          Jeeves buries the sledge in a wall, takes up the chainsaw,
          rips the pullcord, resumes the charge--
          
          Ivy, finds a clip, slams it in the stock, points, pulls--
          trigger-stick, hammer-jam. He falls to his back, scurrying
          away, trouble finding traction, soles slipping-- he keeps
          pulling the trigger. Jeeves straddles him from above, raises
          the saw like a great wooden stake, about to bring it down--
          
          --BAM!
          
          Ivy's automatic discharges. The round splits the saw's gas
          tank, spritzing fuel, dousing Jeeves-- A beat before the
          tank suddenly arcs, exploding, lighting Jeeves up like a
          four-hundred pound bonfire, bouncing him off the walls; a
          human Hindenberg, fully engulfed. He flails, burns, howls,
          falls...molten fat melts off his body like lard butter...
          
          Darwin, dismayed, both brothers down...He moves on Mustache,
          dispatches him with detached efficiency, snapping his neck
          clean. He then starts toward Ivy, who's trying desperately
          to crawl out of there.

          blood trail, trying to reach: Israel, on the ground, dying.
          Soot's gun has jammed. He clears it efficiently, patiently
          reloading the weapon as Doc Gill, in panic mode, performs
          full chest compressions on Buddy as we--

          Messner, doing the same to Carruthers, trying to restart his

          being tended to by a team of agents. In the b.g. Cops and
          Feds gather near the window, searching for the assailant,
          binoculars and rifle scopes strafing the Horizon hotel across
          the way, concentrating at the open window near the top floor.

          WATTERS, running up the hallway, past alarmed maid service

          She sees the Feds and Cops in the Nomad window across the

          expands, sharpens.

          sinks...and she assumes the worst: Sykes is dead.

                    MOTHERFUCKERS!!
          
          She flicks to full-auto and opens fire right through the
          glass in front of her-- big gas-ejected shells pop from the
          breach like bowling pins-- the gathered throng across the
          way in the Nomad window seem to vaporize in a violent collage
          of heat, blood and building chunks-- Watters bucks big sobs,
          blasting away with the Barrett...

          Sykes, standing now, knock-kneed, kevlar discarded, down to
          a black bra and mini-skirt, blood dribbling over her midriff,
          deep indentation near her sternum-- big yellow bruise in
          bloom-- the bullet didn't penetrate...her elevator arrives
          at the penthouse level and as the doors open we--
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Darwin, looming over Ivy, about to bring the sledge down
          squarely on his skull-- the elevator doors open in his
          periphery... He looks over, sees Sykes standing there, barely
          clothed, wet with blood, gun in her hand...and grins.
          
                                                                      101.
          
          Sykes, seeing Darwin standing over Ivy, holding a sledgehammer--
          recognizes him as the perv from earlier. She levels the Glock,
          stepping out of the elevator, steadying herself against the
          wall, steadying her aim on Darwin's head.
          
                                SYKES
                    Drop that hammer...
                        (beat, cocking gun)
                    And I drop this one.

                    Know a killer motherfucker...know
                    they voice. Know they feel...and
                    know you 'bout to die by one.
          
          Then, the sound of an helicopter intrudes, rotor thrum,
          building steadily, growing louder-- the floor seems to shake
          as the chopper approaches-- nervous eyes dart-- nobody moves.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          The chopper draws closer, growing louder-- Hugo, still trying
          to crawl toward his downed boss. Soot finishes him off with
          a flush headshot. Gill, frantic, rapid chest compressions
          on Israel, who gags, starts, coughs, heart back up and
          beating. His watery gaze moves from Gill to Soot, who know
          stands overtop of him, aiming the 9mm down at him.
          
          Israel averts his eyes...the end has come. He looks over
          and sees his lamb-skin coat, lying there, soaking in Beanie's
          blood, ruined beyond recognition. A tear escapes his eye.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    ...forgive me...
          
          Soot puts the gun flush with Buddy's skull when suddenly,
          the ceiling begins to tremble and shake...the sound of a
          helicopter filling the air.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Messner is losing Carruthers, can't revive him, begins to
          crack-- hammering on his chest...it's no use. He's dead.
          He sobs-- something slides from his pocket. He glances down...
          
          ...sees that the bag containing Elmore's severed fingers has
          fallen from his pocket. Doesn't remember hanging onto them.
          He replaces them in his pocket. Looks down at his dead
          friend, sees his severed hand, also missing fingers...
          
          ...the absurdity of this makes Messner want to cry laughing...
          
          ...and that's when he hears the chopper...and sees it as it
          rises up past their floor, past the contingent of Cops and
          Feds slugging it out with Watters across the street.
          
                                                                    102.

          Watters, ears ringing with gunfire reverb, reloading-- salvos
          of return fire ripping back at her-- then, all at once, the
          shooting stops-- She pauses, thinks it's a ploy-- then slowly
          peers over the window sill as the Bell-Ranger comes into
          view, over the Nomad, touching down on its narrow rooftop.
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE -- SAME
          
          The doors to the Penthouse level are bashed open and the
          windows implode as FBI tactical agents repel in, weapons
          drawn, swarming, surrounding the scene, shouting commands--
          Darwin Tremor drops the sledge, jackrabbits for the elevator,
          diving in as the doors close--
          
          Sykes, stumbling toward Ivy. He sees she's injured, scoops
          her up like a new bride-- she places something in his
          hand...Acosta's fake FBI credentials. Ivy looks, nods, gets
          it-- agents approach, combat crouches, MP-5's at arms.
          
                                AGENT #1
                    Let me see your hands!
          
          Ivy, flashing the I.D., taking care to cover the photo.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    This woman's been shot, I need to
                    get her medical attention immediately!
          
          Commotion and confusion swirl. The Agent, unsure, searching
          for some confirmation-- can't find it, dismisses them and
          rushes into the Penthouse. Sykes and Ivy slip out the exit.

          Soot, disarmed, handcuffed. Israel, propped up, sweating
          badly, seizures still hobbling his heart. Gill, being patted
          down by the Agents, prescription pills confiscated. Soot is
          held at gunpoint and flex-cuffed, the remainder of rubber
          appliance pulled off his face.
          
          The agents begin to initiate an "All Clear" over their radios.
          Moments pass before Deputy Director Locke enters the room,
          He approaches Soot, studies him, to one of the agents;
          
                                   LOCKE
                    Soot?
          
          The Agent nods confirmation. Locke reaches into Soot's coat,
          finds his cellphone...hits redial.

          He reaches the seventeenth floor, rounds the corner, nearly
          runs into Messner, has a gun thrust in his face.

          Sykes recognizes him and in a blink has a gun under his chin.

          Messner, eyes moving from Ivy to Sykes. Stalemate, no sense
          pushing. He moves past them, hits the stairwell exit on

          yet more blood on himself. Satisfied, he snatches Carruthers'
          F.B.I. credentials up off the floor...and waits.

          an abrupt about face and disappears back inside the car.
          
          Watters lowers the gun, wipes tears, the area around her is
          littered with spent .50 caliber shells. The fourteenth floor
          of the Nomad is now empty. Sirens wail in the distance.
          Down below, Watters can see a bevy of law enforcement
          personnel streaming toward the Horizon. She slowly takes
          the Barrett off the ledge, begins breaking it down, glancing
          up at the Penthouse of the Nomad as we...
          
                                                             ...CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- SAME
          
          Director Locke waits. Messner and The Swede appear in the
          doorway. The Swede nods to all concerned and starts toward
          Israel. Doc Gill acknowledges the Swede.
          
                                DR. GILL
                    Dr. Ingstrom, he's had a mild cardiac
                    episode and recurring arrhythmia,
                    I've given him 60cc's of Nobuneatol...
          
          The Swede kneels down next to Israel, dropping his black
          valise, cracking it open. Messner, dazed, dumbfounded, sees
          Locke.
          
                                MESSNER
                    ...Deputy Director Locke?
          
          Locke approaches, lays a comforting arm on Messner, guiding
          him to a chair.
          
                                 LOCKE
                    Here. Sit.   Please.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (pointing to Swede)
                    This is him? The hitman hired to
                    kill Israel? He's a doctor?
          
                                LOCKE
                    Difficult to explain everything now...
                        (beat, toward Israel)
                    And much larger issues loom.
                        (beat)
                    I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest
                    thing to have to die for.
          
          The Swede, working on Israel, shaking his head, something's
          wrong. He stands, crosses to Locke, silently confers.
          
                                                                   107.

                    Very well.

                    Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he'll
                    be traveling with us.
          
          Suddenly, Soot breaks from his captors, sprinting for the
          shattered Penthouse windows, launching himself-- a swan dive
          out into the open air-- He hangs there for a moment, an
          aesthetically striking form; like Lazarus cast against a
          cobalt blue sky, backlit by the sun from the lake below--
          
          --till gravity grabs, pulls-- plummeting him toward earth,
          sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below.
          This startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a
          collective lack of concern.
          
          Messner is absolutely agog.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to Locke, forceful)
                    What the hell-- What is this!? People
                    died. Agent Carruthers is dead!

                    the coming days.
          
          Locke says no more-- starts out of the Penthouse with the
          Swede, Dr. Gill and Buddy Israel in tow. A Bureau forensics
          team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead...Messner stands
          there, absolutely agog.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY -- DAY
          
          Hives of activity. Cordons and crime scene lockdowns like
          onion layers, multiple law enforcement agencies, confounded,
          confused-- too many cooks, too many kitchens. Nobody knows
          who the hells in charge. Local paramedics and EMT's cart
          out the wounded. Coroners and M.E.'s cart out the dead.
          
          Reporters and national news outlets crowd police barricades
          outside, competing for coverage, as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Acosta is wheeled through the lobby, hooked up to IV and
          oxygen, looking ghastly, like something exhumed. He catches
          the eye of the pimply casino employee and manages a wink.
          
                                                                   108.
          
          He's flex-cuffed to the gurney and pushed against the wall
          for the moment as the Agents move off to deal with the recent
          appearance of Lazlo Soot-- whose body has been unceremoniously
          splattered over the parking lot.
          
          As the Agents depart, Acosta peers down at his shackles;
          simple plastic binding rods-- he smiles...a moment later the
          stiletto blade fires from his sleeve as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Darwin Tremor staggering out of an open elevator, blood-
          sodden, head down-- FBI badge held aloft for all its worth.
          Playing it up, free pass, Agents rush in, hold him upright,
          help him toward a line of awaiting ambulances outside as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Ivy and Sykes, being released from the stairwell, cut chains
          sliding off-- Ivy holds up pilfered FBI creds. Rampant
          confusion makes the moment possible. He's waved through,
          carrying Sykes, looking every bit the good Samaritan.
          
          Sykes, a mess of mascara, adorned in her unmentionables,
          looking every bit the prostitute she appears to be-- she
          spots the woman at the counter from earlier. The woman gazes
          back, jaw agape. Sykes can only shrug...if you can't beat
          'em-- join 'em. She and Ivy cross the lobby as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Messner...morose, exiting another elevator with the sheet-
          draped body of Carruthers on a gurney. Gandersen, the Nomad
          owner, spots him, starts over, looks to unleash, gets close
          enough to catch Messner's expression. Sees it in his
          eyes...enough dead bodies for one day. Messner continues
          moving through the lobby, hears the chopper taking off as--
          
          CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL:
          
          Through the clear glass atrium of the Nomad, the Bell-Ranger
          goes airborne against an impossibly clear winter sky, banking
          south toward Las Vegas.
          
          CAMERA TILTS DOWN TO REVEAL:
          
          The Horizon hotel across the way: The Fourteenth floor window.
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Watters, gear stowed, seemingly indifferent about the level
          of law enforcement heading up her way, about to launch an
          Alamo-like last stand in honor of her fallen sista.
          
          She hears commotion erupt from outside as survivors begin
          filing from the building. She takes up the Barrett, gazing
          through the scope, looking, looking, looking...stops...holy
          shit...it's her. It's Sykes.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          And she's alive and being carried by a man, a big gorgeous
          black man that she's gazing upon with utter love and longing.
          A boulder-sized lump takes shape in Watters throat; betrayed,
          backbit-- tears come to fast to contain, too many to control.
          
          Numbed...the sensation leaving her fingers, she finds herself
          racking the bolt on the Barrett and gazing through
          crosshairs...taking aim on Ivy's head. Behind her, the
          elevator arrives, an a dozen armed cops, hoo-rah from it,
          hustling the length of the hall, descending down on her--
          
                                WATTERS
                        (whispering)
                    ...I loved you baby...
          
          BOOM!
          
          EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE -- NOMAD HOTEL -- SAME
          
          A gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks-- Darwin Tremor
          snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of
          Cops and Feds now rushing that way. His I.D. is out,
          affording him easy egress. He hops the stairs up, top level,
          Barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. As he approaches...
          
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey...
          
          Darwin glances over at...Hollis Elmore, standing there, skin
          horribly discolored, disease afflicted. He wears a hooded
          tourist sweatsuit; "Ta-Hoe, Ta-Hoe It's Off To Fun We Go!"
          stitched in cursive across the front. He's holding the Colt
          Python against his hip.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (nodding to Cuda)
                    That your car?
          
          Darwin, a beat, what-to-do...hillbilly-acumen in overdrive.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I'm confiscating it.
                        (holding up badge)
                    F.B.I.
          
          Now Elmore raises the Colt with his good hand, advancing on
          Darwin, moving gingerly, his legs not quite there...
          
                                ELMORE
                    You're F.B.I.?
          
          Darwin tries to stay tight, composed.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    That's right...and I'd advise y'ta
                    lower your weapon sir.
          
          Elmore keeps coming.
          
                                                                   110.
          
                                 ELMORE
                    You investigating those murders out
                    at the lake?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                        (blanching a bit)
                    Ww...uh...
          
                                ELMORE
                    Three men were ambushed and shot,
                    two died and had their bodies tossed
                    into the lake, the other has severe
                    hypothermia, possible dementia and
                    will probably be a multiple amputee
                    by week's end...if he even lives
                    that long.
          
          Darwin, uh-oh...
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I ain't even heard abou--
          
          --Oops.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (even more menace)
                    You "ain't"--
                        (beat, teeth clenched)
                    You have any idea how close to death
                    I've been? You understand that I'm
                    dying now? That I've survived bullets
                    and frostbite and raging fever--
                        (holding up hand)
                    missing fingers and every fucking
                    imaginable horror in between?
          
          Darwin...speechless...he's done.
          
                                ELMORE (CONT'D)
                    And I'm asking you now, "Is that
                    your car" and you can't even come
                    clean and do me the decency of a
                    straight answer, with the fucking
                    state that I'm in!?
          
          Elmore, that Colt looking like a cannon this close to Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm
                    sorry.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You shot me and murdered my friends.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I did. We-- yeah, I know.
          
                                                                   111.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And threw us into the lake.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Pretty much, yep.
          
          Elmore, still nodding.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And this is your car, isn't it?
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Mmm-hmm.
          
                                ELMORE
                    But there were more of you?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make
                    it.
          
                                   ELMORE
                    Two of 'em?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                        (nods, tears flow)
                    Thass' right.
                        (beat, wiping eyes)
                    I got other brother's though, so it
                    ain't so bad.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You were here huntin' a man named
                    Israel, weren't you? Your name is
                    Tremor.
          
          Darwin gazes up at Elmore, some fraternal bond forms.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I was. It is...That who you was here
                    for? Israel?
          
          A pause. Elmore nods.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    Well...we both got beat out then,
                    didn't we?
          
          Darwin, slowly lowering the Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    Yes we did...
                        (long pause, then)
                    Now, give me your car keys. And get
                    the fuck out of here.
          
          Darwin, sifting through his pockets, tossing Elmore the keys.
          
                                                                     112.

                    S'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.
          
          Elmore brings the Colt back up.   Darwin, hands up, hold on--
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    No, no, no, I'm done with all that.
          
          He reaches in, pulls a joint off the dashboard, forages,
          finds matches, lights up, starts off.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                        (to 'Cuda)
                    Probably needs to be tuned. Air
                    filter's old. Plugs might be bad.
                    Heater and AC ain't worked in forever.
                        (seeing Elmore waver)
                    There's some good drugs in the glove
                    box there, homespun, keep you smiling,
                    semi-lucid at leas'...
                        (beat, puffing away)
                    Well, God's speed t'ya then. Sorry
                    'bout all that. S'way a'the world
                    though, winners and losers y'know.
                    S'way it's always goin' be...
          
          Darwin, walking away, taking huge hits off that joint,
          traipsing down the steps, getting stoned out of his mind.
          Elmore, considering, re-considering, looking at that Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    ...Oh, fuck that...
          
          --As he back shoots Darwin with all six rounds from the
          Python, blowing holes through him. Darwin goes lop-sided,
          legs failing, lit-joint still smoking in his mouth as dies
          standing, only to fall like cut timber seconds later.
          
          Elmore acts quickly, sliding into the 'Cuda and starting it,
          that big block Hemi roaring to life under the hood.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- DAY
          
          Pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the Nomad,
          the bottleneck bogs traffic down, making it impossible to
          move. Elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel
          cross in front of the car... Slowly, the crosswalk begins to
          thin and then finally clear...save a single man:
          
          Messner...standing right in front of the Barracuda, staring
          at the tires, staring at Elmore. The two lock eyes as he
          moves around to the driver's side, reaching into his pocket--
          
          --Elmore lifts the Colt up off his lap, putting his heavily
          bandaged hand on the wheel. Then he sees Messner's FBI creds,
          clipped to his belt-- can't tell if this one's legit.
          
                                                                   113.
          
          He sets the Colt down on the floorboard as Messner walks up,
          pulling a plastic bag from his pocket: The one containing
          three severed fingers. He glances down at Elmore's mummified
          left hand, holding out the bag for him to take.
          
          Elmore, unsure, accepting the bag, seeing what's inside,
          embarrassed by it-- he sets it down on the seat next to him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Your friends were taken to Carson
                     City Memorial, they're going to be
                     autopsied and shipped back for burial.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I'll take care of it.
          
          Messner, nodding. A beat.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Who owned this car?
          
          Beat.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     The ones that killed 'em.
          
          Beat.   Messner nods.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Where are they now?
          
          Elmore looks up at him-- what does it matter...
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I just want to go home man...I just
                     want to go home and forget this
                     fucking place even exists.
          
                                 MESSNER

          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- LAS VEGAS NEVADA -- DAY
          
          Messner walks in, cleaned up, pressed suit, no tie. He badges
          himself past the front desk. An ORDERLY approaches.
          
                                                                      114.

          Messner nods.
          
                                ORDERLY (CONT'D)

          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- THIRD FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Messne exits the stairwell. Droves of Feds and justice
          department types crowd the third floor hallway, around the
          I.C.U. The mood is subdued. The Swede exits a per-op suite,
          dressed in scrubs and a surgical gown, talking with Dr. Gill,
          who is also dressed for surgery.
          
          Messner searches the hall for a familiar face...finds
          it...Locke, far end, talking with an aide.
          
                                LOCKE

                    Basic bullet points-- despondent
                    over the turn his career had taken,
                    troubles with the law, history of
                    substance abuse and so on--
          
          The aide sees Messner approach. Locke follows her eyes, turns.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Where's Israel?

                    --no, we need to handle it now.
          
          Locke, angered, handing his clipboard to the aide, taking
          Messner by the arm, leading him away.
          
                                LOCKE

          A gun is in Locke's side now-- against his ribs-- he looks
          down, stunned...Now it's Messner who's leading him away.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       You're going to tell me why no call
                       was made to inform us that the Israel

          Locke, pale, shook up.

                           (jams gun into ribs)
                       The Swede isn't a hitman, is he?
                       He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't
                       want Israel's heart for a trophy, he
                       wanted it for a transplant...why?

          Locke and Messner enter. In an oxygen tent erected on one
          side of the room, sits the shrunken figure of Primo Sparazza.
          On the other, a barely conscious Buddy Israel. Both men are

                        (after a moment)
                    What do you mean "Who Sparazza
                    actually was..."
          
          Locke says nothing...Messner levels his gun on him.

          Locke reluctantly hands Messner the confidential package we
          saw delivered to him earlier in the film. Messner pulls the
          photos of a post-op Primo Sparazza--

                    You realize that Sparraza has had
                    thirty-six major medical procedures
                    performed on him since 1953? Elective
                    plastic surgery, every single one--

                    to save his life. And it wasn't
                    cosmetic, it was reconstructive...Look

          Jersey Turnpike. The past: A '51 Ford Fairlane, flush with
          an embankment, bullet perforated, dead-body draped. A top-
          coated man stalks the vehicle's sole survivor, FREEMAN HELLER,
          shooting him in the back. He rolls over and is shot point
          blank in the face. THE CAMERA TILTS UP to the top-coated
          gunman, who returns the pistol to its holster, revealing...

                    Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias.
                    He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed
                    under for over ten years, amassing
                    materials against the mafia and other
                    criminal syndicates. He may have
                    ripped the organization wide open,
                    pre-Appalachia, but his superiors
                    were convinced that he had gone rogue,
                    swapped allegiances...So they gave
                    the order to terminate his cover.

          perverting...then, inexplicably...those blue eyes blink.

                    He survived the shooting but the
                    injuries he sustained triggered a
                    degenerative bone disease that
                    required constant surgery, forever
                    altering his features...so he assumed

                    The agents of that era are all dead

                    op predates the second world war.

          Locke, not getting it as Messner takes aim on the oxygen
          tent containing Sparazza. Locke's eyes inflate, he reaches-

     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT

     Fog.  Penetrated only by sound.  The LAPPING of sea at a drifting
     hull.  Tendrils of mist part, revealing...

     ...a face.  Strong and blond and handsome.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  SEPTEMBER 15, 1954

     LONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross
     spar of his mast.  He has pulled a SHUTTLE of TWINE from his rubber
     overalls, and is LASHING a LANTERN in the cloud of mist, as MAIN
     TITLES BEGIN...

     ANGLE...the tiny, meticulously neat cabin.  Empty, silent.  A tin
     COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.  The battery well open, revealing
     two large BATTERIES in place.  PAN to...

     ...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.  The fishing net stretched
     from the huge DRUM into the sea.  Keep PANNING to the bow, where...

     ...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching
     as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.  The silhouette of a
     FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.  As fragments of fog part,
     we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see...

     ...his eyes.  They are Asian.  SMASH CUT to...

     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - MORNING

     Blinding sun.  Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water.  As CREDITS
     CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.  SHERIFF ART
     MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.  Only the eyes
     reflect his disquiet.  His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts
     anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.  As the net brings
     silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to...

     ...the cabin.  Tidy as before.  Only two things have changed.
     CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the
     floor.  PAN above the open battery well, where a third MARINE
     BATTERY now stands next to the wheel.  CUT to...

     ...the stern, as the raveling net LIFTS from the water's surface...

     ...the face of Carl Heine.  Turned to the sun.  SMASH CUT to...

     INT. CORONER'S LAB - DAY

     WHITE fills the frame.  A hand PULLS back the blanket-shroud
     revealing Carl's face.  As CREDITS CONTINUE, tilt up to the
     coroner, HORACE WHALEY, gazing down.  A shading of regret behind
     the professional mask.  A series of QUICK CUTS...

     ...Whaley's hand pulls the SHUTTLE of TWINE from Carl's pocket...

     ...examines the open, empty KNIFE SHEATH at Carl's belt...

     ...Carl's wrist, its WATCH stopped at 1:47...

     Whaley bends over Carl's body, presses on his solar plexus,
     watching pink FOAM rise from Carl's mouth and nose.  And then.
     He sees something more.  His fingers gently pull back the hair
     from above Carl's left ear, to reveal...

     ...a skull wound.  The bone caved in.  Four inches across.

     EXT. SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY

     Snow falling on cedars.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  DECEMBER 6.

     The heavens descend softly onto our island.  Exquisite, silent,
     hypnotic.  An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against
     the limitless scope of nature.  As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of
     QUICK ANGLES...

     ...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned
     school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows...

     ...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens
     waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene...

     ...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels
     blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building
     a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water,
     and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes...

     ...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and
     flawless as the Sahara...

     Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can,
     people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we
     FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to...

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on impassive EYES.  They are Asian.  We have seen them
     before.  PULL BACK to see...

     KABUO MIYAMOTO.  Early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt.  He sits
     ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a
     storm of movement in...

     ...the assembling COURTROOM.  A packed gallery of buzzing locals,
     the scent of anticipation.  A bank of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS,
     cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries
     from the civilized world.  As we PAN their ranks...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It was the first murder trial on
                     the island in thirty-one years.

     ...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's,
     dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on
     his right leg.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Our only newspaper was the San
                     Piedro Review, a four-page weekly
                     that I operated alone.

     He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     What, I wondered, could the Seattle
                     boys know of the hearts of these
                     people...

     To the JURY BOX.  Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober
     neckties.  A waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Neighbors, sitting in judgement.
                     On their neighbor.

     To the neighbor.  The ramrod-still defendant.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid
                     grace of a Samurai warrior.  As if
                     detached from his own trial.

     Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee,
     until...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Did he know how dangerous his demeanor
                     could be?  With this jury.

     ...it falls with a CLATTER of pages.  He reaches with his right
     hand, replaces the pad on his thigh.  Around him, CAMERAS are being
     swung to the ready.  Ishmael looks to see...

     ...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom.
     A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable
     box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more,
     unheeded.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Hatsue Miyamoto had been without
                     her husband for 77 days.

     Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad.
     For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated
     left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He was in jail.  When his baby son
                     learned to walk.

     Through his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first
     row.  And sensing her presence, her husband turns.  Their eyes
     meet.  A string of FLASHES...

     But none from Ishmael.  He hesitates.  As if considering whether he
     will violate this woman's privacy.  The camera lowers.  HOLD on his
     face...

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

     MATCH CUT to Hatsue's face.  Staring, impassive, empty.  PULL BACK
     to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door.
     Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap.  Her demeanor as
     removed from this place as is her husband's.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Earlier, I noticed her in the
                     corridor.

     PULL BACK to see him alone, in shadow.  It is more than a notice.
     Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as
     she gathers her thoughts.  A moment of decision.  He approaches.
     Stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her
     personal space.  And softer than we might have imagined...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Are you all right?

     She turns her head only slightly.  It is enough.  Her voice quiet
     and firm at once...

                               HATSUE
                     Go away, Ishmael.

     There is no anger.  Only directness and resolve.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Please don't be like th...

                               HATSUE (softer)
                     Go away.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     PAN the back of the courtroom.  Twenty-four citizens of Japanese
     ancestry fill the last row, dressed in their most formal clothes.
     Shades of Atticus Finch.  As one, the Japanese-Americans watch...

     ...the prosecutor, ALVIN HOOKS, a crisp, even dapper man.  There is
     a quickness about the eyes, a tendency to sharpness of manner, that
     he works carefully against...

                               HOOKS
                     ...four inch gash, skull crushed,
                     and your thought was, what...?

     JUDGE FIELDING, tall and gray and rawboned, leans on his elbows,
     his eyelids droop slightly, a deceptive masking of keen attention.

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     That he...fell?  Hit his head on
                     the gunnel going over?

     The witness is Sheriff Moran.  He answers as if this were a sincere
     question.  As if he had never heard it before.

                               MORAN
                     Well, Carl was six-four, went 235.
                     He was a grizzly bear and an able
                     seaman...

     Ishmael watching.  Thinking on that.

                               MORAN (O.S.)
                     For him to just...go over.  Crush
                     his skull like that on the way in...

     HOLD on Ishmael.

     INT. TEAM BUS - DAY

     Teenage BOYS in football uniforms.  They ride with their helmets in
     their laps.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He was a mountain, all right.
                     Anchored the line for us little
                     fellers.

     CLOSE on Carl and Ishmael at 18, riding together.  Ishmael, dark
     and rugged even then, is scarcely little.  But dwarfed by the blond
     giant at his side, who glares out the window, at...

                               CARL
                     Chambers.  Y'see the geese?

     ...snow geese landing in low flooded wheat.  The grace of it holds
     both boys.

                               CARL
                     Picture'd be nice.  In your pa's
                     paper.

     Ishmael nods absently.  They stare, side-by-side.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Lucky I got the camera in my
                     helmet.

     They never look at each other.  They never smile.  But you can
     almost hear one in...

                               CARL
                     Careful, Chambers.  That was almost
                     a joke.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium.
     Like chatting with the Sheriff across the back fence...

                               HOOKS
                     And you weren't there, when the
                     coroner examined the wound.

                               MORAN
                     Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid...
                     to tell Mrs. Heine.

     And his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the
     prosecutor's table.  Taking the glances of the jury with it.
     SUSAN MARIE HEINE is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her
     modest black dress.  Composure and dignity.  Against her grief.

     EXT. HEINE HOME - DAY

     Moran climbs from his vehicle, as Carl's young SONS dash around the
     corner of the house.  Seeing the Sheriff, they stop cold.  Silent,
     shirtless, barefoot.

                               MORAN
                     Hey there, men.  Is your mother
                     home a-tall?

     He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper.  And as the younger boy
     nods across the distance...

                               SUSAN MARIE (O.S.)
                     Sheriff Moran, hullo.

     She has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle-marked baby's
     diaper across her shoulder.  And he smiles back.  Tells the boys...

                               MORAN
                     You go on and play, now.

     But they don't.  So he follows into her entryway, closing the door
     behind him.  And at the foot of her curving staircase...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     What can I do for you, Sheriff,
                     Carl's not home y...

                               MORAN
                     That's...

     Too quick.  He stops himself.  And she sees that.

                               MORAN
                     It's why I'm here.  I'm afraid I
                     have some...very bad news to tell
                     you, the...worst...kind of news.

     She looks at him, uncomprehending, the smile only beginning to
     fade, before...

                               MORAN
                     Carl died last night.  In a fishing
                     accident.  In White Sand Bay.

     She only blinks.  As if translating the words from a foreign
     language.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     No, Carl's fine, h...

                               MORAN
                     We found him, Mrs. Heine.  Tangled
                     in his net.

     And with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she
     stumbles back one step, sitting down HARD on the bottom stair of
     her curved staircase.

     He doesn't know what to do.  She digs her elbows into her lap, and
     begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands.  Her
     face is more terrible than tears.  It is frightened.  She murmurs
     to herself, so that we can barely hear...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I told him this could happen.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on Hooks, nodding.  As if, slowly, digesting something in his
     mind.

                               HOOKS
                     So, no...immediate suspicion,
                     no...general talk of enmity
                     between the two.

                               MORAN
                     These are fishermen, Alvin.  They
                     don't talk at all to each other
                     and less to me.  Specially gossip.

     EXT. DOCKS - DAY

     Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf.  Purpose in his stride...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     A gill-netter works through black
                     nights with only himself to talk
                     to.  And learns to be silent.
                     They were lonely men and products
                     of geography.

     Up ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock.  Moran stands
     chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...men who, on occasion, realized
                     that they wished to speak, but
                     couldn't.

     As he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting.  Not happy to see him.
     Of course, neither is anyone else.

                               MORAN
                     Figure you'da heard by now.

     Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness.  WILLIAM GJOVAAG, a
     sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp
     cigar butt.

                               GJOVAAG
                     You go fishing, it happens.

                               ISHMAEL (to Moran)
                     You see Susan Marie?

                               MORAN
                     I did.  Boy.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Three kids.  What's she going to do?

                               GJOVAAG (disgusted)
                     Well, what can she do?  Jesus Christ.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Excuse me, Gjovaag.

                               GJOVAAG
                     I don't need to excuse nothin'.
                     Fuck you anyhow, Chambers.

     Everybody laughs.  It is all good-natured, sort of.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Like the Sheriff, I did not work
                     the sea, and could never merit trust.
                     Or respect.

                               MARTY JOHANSSON
                     Sheriff's been askin' which boats
                     followed Carl out last night...

                               MORAN (quickly)
                     Only to see if somebody talked to
                     him out th...

                               ISHMAEL
                     So who talked to him?  Out there.

     Staring.  At each other.  Eye contact holds during...

                               JAN SORENSEN (heavy Danish)
                     So far, we figured the guys who went
                     to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry,
                     Hardwell, Moulton, Miyamoto...

                               GJOVAAG (spits)
                     Japs.

                               MORAN
                     All right, look, if you see these
                     boys...

                               GJOVAAG
                     Never saw you so hard-ass, Art.
                     Ain't this just an accident?

     Moran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmael's.  Which are right there,
     waiting.  Moran looks away.

                               MORAN
                     Course it is, but a man's dead,
                     William.  I got to write my report.

     ANGLE...Ishmael and Moran, walking alone back up the wharf.  The
     Sheriff is worried.  Finally...

                               MORAN
                     I'm not gonna see some article
                     about an investigation, am I?

                               ISHMAEL (quietly)
                     You want me to lie?

                               MORAN
                     No, I wanna be off the damn record,
                     that's what I want.

     No answer.  They keep walking.

                               MORAN
                     I mean, if there is a killer, why
                     would you want him all alerted?

     Silence.  Silence.  And slowly...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Let's say...someday I need some
                     cooperation from you on this thing.
                     Do I get it?

     And looks over.  Like the guy holding all the aces.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Moran fidgets on the stand.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     No sign of a struggle, you say.

     SEE him now.  NELS GUDMUNDSSON, attorney for Kabuo Miyamoto, stands
     beside his impassive client.  Nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a
     little shaky.  His body is winding down.

                               MORAN
                     Well, the coffee cup was layin' right
                     in the middle of the floor, like I
                     said.  And with a fella so neat as
                     Carl, that did seem peculiar.

     And Nels begins to walk toward him.  Limping, as he comes.

                               NELS
                     As peculiar as a struggle between
                     a 235 pound man, and an assailant
                     strong enough to subdue him...that
                     leaves only a single overturned cup
                     in its wake?

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     Objection, asking the witness to
                     speculate.

                               NELS
                     My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to
                     object every time you did that?

     A real.  Friendly smile.

                               JUDGE (wearily)
                     That's quite enough horseplay,
                     Nels, why don't you act your age?

                               NELS
                     If I did that Your Honor, I'd
                     be dead.

     Some gentle laughter.  Judge Fielding doesn't even bother to look
     annoyed.

                               JUDGE
                     Any more homely loveable tricks,
                     and you'll be worse than that.
                     Proceed, gentlemen.

                               HOOKS
                     There's an objection, Your H...

                               JUDGE
                     And it's overruled, answer the
                     question.  If you can recall it.

                               MORAN
                     Maybe the assailant straightened
                     the cabin.  And forgot the cup.

                               NELS
                     Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.

                               MORAN
                     Maybe.

     Nels nods to himself, as if considering that.  So that the jury

                               NELS
                     I think you testified all the
                     lights were on.  Cabin, mast,
                     net lights, picking lights...

                               MORAN
                     Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.

                               NELS
                     And yet you started the engine
                     right up.  With all those lights
                     drawing all night, the batteries
                     had that much charge.  Did that
                     strike you odd?

                               MORAN
                     Didn't think about it at the time.
                     So no, it didn't strike me odd.

                               NELS
                     Does it now?

                               MORAN
                     A little.  Yes.  You have to
                     wonder.

                               NELS
                     You have to wonder.

     And lets that sit.  Scratches his neck.

                               NELS
                     You found three batteries, you
                     say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well.
                     And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor.
                     Correct?

                               MORAN
                     It is.

                               NELS
                     Now I did some measuring down at
                     the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch
                     wider than a D-8.  It would be too
                     large for the deceased's well.

                               MORAN
                     He's done some on-the-spot refit-
                     ting.  You could see the side flange
                     was banged away to make room for
                     the D-6.

                               NELS
                     But he had a spare D-6, you said.
                     Right there.  Why not use that?

                               MORAN
                     It was dead.  We had it tested.
                     Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he
                     had to use it.

     Ah.

                               NELS
                     Maybe he carried a spare that
                     was too large to fit.  So he'd
                     have to bang out the flange to
                     squeeze it in?

     No answer to that.  The silence rests.

                               NELS
                     Sheriff, how many batteries and
                     what size did you find on defendant's
                     boat?

                               MORAN
                     Two D-6's.  That's the kind his
                     well was fitted for.

                               NELS
                     No spare.

                               MORAN
                     No.

                               NELS
                     So the defendant went out fishing
                     for the night with no spare battery,

                     Apparently.

                               NELS
                     I'm curious.  The D-6 that was
                     refitted into the deceased's well.
                     Was it exactly the same brand and
                     model as defendant's?

     A beat.

                               MORAN
                     I believe so.

                               NELS
                     Now you've testified that the
                     deceased was a heavy man, and hard
                     to bring out of the net.

                               MORAN
                     I don't think so.

                               NELS
                     You don't.  Think so.

                               MORAN
                     He was heavy, but we were real
                     careful.  But I don't remember him
                     hitting anything, anywhere.

                               NELS
                     You don't.  Remember.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Horace Whaley, the county coroner, folds his stork-like limbs
     uncomfortably.  Searching for the appearance of ease.

     EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAWN

     Mist of early light.  Two dark figures, little more than
     silhouettes, measuring each other with their lethal bokken staffs.
     We may think of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, for one is a full-
     grown man.  The other, eight years old.  Dialogue plays in
     subtitled JAPANESE...

                               ZENHICHI
                     Hips, stomach, cut.  Stomach muscles
                     tighten as stroke advances...

     And STRIKES a fearsome blow, which the child REPELS with startling
     proficiency.  We can see ZENHICHI's stony face, now.  If he is
     impressed by his son, he does not show it.

                               ZENHICHI

     WHAP!  The child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his
     father's HEAD.  It has been blocked.  The staffs rest against each
     other, just above Zenhichi's ear.  There is no anger in either
     warrior.  That we can see.

                     Elbow soft.  A little better.

     LATER...father and son sit on the ground, eating a small meal.
     The sun has risen, angling light across the undulating fields.
     They are alone in beauty.  A long silence.  Dialogue in subtitled

                     If you begin to concentrate.

     Eyes on his food.  As if alone, as if speaking to himself.  The boy
     darting glances, unseen, at his father's profile.

                               ZENHICHI
                     You must choose now, Kabuo.  At eight
                     years.  If you want this.

                               KABUO (boldly)
                     I want it.

     The father keeps eating.  Never turns.

                     So this...foam you found in the

                               WHALEY
                     As I testified.  It occurs when
                     water, mucus and air are mixed by

                               NELS (slightly confused)
                     But a drowned person can't breathe.

                               WHALEY
                     Of course not.  The foam means
                     that he went in breathing.

     Ah.

                               WHALEY
                     That's why the autopsy report
                     identifies drowning as the cause
                     of death.

                               NELS
                     Meaning that he wasn't murdered
                     first, say on the deck of the boat,
                     and then thrown overboard.

                               NELS
                     Your report says death by drowning,
                     which means he went into the water
                     alive and breathing.  And the report
                     is accurate...?

                               WHALEY (bristles)

                     Of course, it is.  Now as to the
                     head injury.  You say made by an
                     object narrow and flat.  That is
                     your inference, correct?

                               WHALEY (really pissed)
                     It's my job to infer, that's what
                     coroners do.  You get hit with a
                     crowbar, or a ball-peen hammer, or
                     fall off a motorcycle, the injuries

                     sustained before or after death?

     Whaley thinks.

                               WHALEY
                     For certain, no.

                               NELS
                     But you are certain that he died
                     by drowning.

                               WHALEY
                     For the third time, yes.

     Nels nods.  Whaley is beyond frustrated.

                               WHALEY
                     Can I say something, here?

                               NELS
                     Yes, you can tell me about the
                     minor cut you found on the deceased's
                     right hand.  The report says 'recent
                     origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24
                     hours before death?

                               WHALEY
                     Absolutely not.  Probably one or two
                     hours.  Four at the most.

     A pause.

                               NELS
                     Are you absol...

                               WHALEY
                     Yes, I'm sure.

     Nels nods.  Silence.

                               NELS
                     Thank you, Horace.  No more
                     questions.

     Horace wants to say more.  Doesn't immediately move.

                               JUDGE
                     We'll take our luncheon recess.
                     Reconvene at...2 o'clock sharp.

     The gavel CRACKS onto the block.  Judge Fielding stands to leave,
     and the BAILIFF begins to usher the jury from its box.  Abel
     Martinson, the deputy, stands near as Kabuo rises.  As he puts his
     hand gently on Kabuo's arm, the defendant turns smoothly...

     ...to face a woman.  Standing at the rail.  And beneath the
     courtroom buzz...

                               KABUO
                     How are the kids?

     The voice so colloquially American, we are taken back.  Having
     envisioned Kabuo as a silent Samurai.

                               HATSUE
                     They need their father.

     The look holds.  Abel increasingly uneasy.

                               KABUO
                     Well.  Just a few more days.

                               ABEL (coughs)
                     Look, Art's gonna want me t...

                               KABUO (ignoring him)
                     You look beautiful.

     Abel grasps his arm.

                               HATSUE
                     I look terrible.  Don't sit so
                     straight like Tojo's soldier.  The
                     jury will be afraid of you.

     He thinks about that.  Abel tugs him.

                               KABUO
                     Okay, I'll hide under the table
                     from now on.  That make you happy?

     And for the first time.  He smiles.  And seems suddenly very
     American indeed.  She stares back, her heart in her eyes.  Abel
     tugs harder, but he can't budge the defendant.

                               KABUO
                     I'm not going until you smile.

     But she doesn't.  So his fades.  One last look.  And he lets Abel
     lead him away.

     HOLD on her.  Watching him go.

     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT

     Stars above a desert.  Wind gusts.  PAN barbed wire, rows of dark
     barracks blurred by swirling dust, to...

     ...a fragile tar paper structure, its 'walls' rippling pre-
     cariously.  And inside, to see that it is...

     INT. BUDDHIST CHAPEL - NIGHT

     ...a makeshift sanctuary.  Candles, offerings of fruit.  A young
     COUPLE together before a Buddhist PRIEST.  Kabuo and Hatsue.
     Becoming one.

     INT. BARRACKS - LATER

     A cramped, ramshackle room.  Dust blowing through gaps in the
     flimsy beams.  Kerosene light.  FUJIKO IMADA hangs the last of
     the woolen army blankets to divide the room in half, as her four
     youngest DAUGHTERS watch.  We PUSH THROUGH the blankets to the
     other side, to see...

     ...the newlyweds.  Standing at a window in their wedding clothes.
     Kissing.  Slow and full.  Until she whispers into his ear...

                               HATSUE
                     They'll hear everything.

     And her young husband turns.  Speaks to the curtain.

                               KABUO (loud)
                     There must be something good on
                     the radio!

     She giggles.  His hands trace her body.

                               KABUO (louder)
                     Wouldn't some music be nice?

     And in a moment.  The MUSIC begins.  Glenn Miller.  A song that
     sent our boys off to war.  And our young American prisoners...

     ...begin to undress each other.  Her slender fingers find the
     buttons of his shirt, deftly undoing it, as he kisses her face.
     He unclasps her dress.  And as it falls from her shoulders, falls
     to the floor, we PUSH INTO her eyes, and...

     INTERCUT her MEMORY of...

     ...a beach.  Two 10-year-old CHILDREN floating on the water.
     Clinging to a wooden box, with a glass bottom for fish-watching.
     The girl is Asian.  The boy is not.

                               HATSUE
                     Ishmael.  See the yellow one?

     And the boy wriggles around, leans over the box, as if seeking a
     better view.  And KISSES the girl.  Full on her startled mouth.

     BACK TO...the newlyweds.  On their cot now.  Close together.  Naked
     and hungry for each other.

                               KABUO (loud)
                     Can the music be louder, please?
                     We can't hear so good in here!

     The girl laughs soundlessly.  And as the music BLARES, he has slid
     his body above hers.  A whisper...

                               KABUO
                     Have you ever done this?

     A whisper back, sure and strong...

                               HATSUE
                     Never.  You're my only.

     And as he enters her.  As she holds him close with all her
     strength.  Her lips breathe into his ear...

                               HATSUE
                     ...so right.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hatsue watching her husband disappear through a door.  RACK FOCUS
     to see across the way.  A man stares at her.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Course, we grew up together.

     INT. IMADA PARLOR - DAY

     Hatsue at 12, sits with an OLD WOMAN who guides her silently,
     exquisitely, through the ritual of the tea ceremony.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Her mom had this Mrs. Shigemura
                     come on Wednesdays.  Teach her
                     how to be Japanese.

     The woman turns the cup in her hands.  One-quarter turn.  Bows
     slightly, as she presents the tea.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Dances, calligraphy.  Doing her hair.
                     How to sit without moving...

     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY

     Hatsue and Ishmael, both 12, are sprawled on the ground, sheltered
     in the hollowed-out base of a cedar tree.  They watch the rain as
     it pummels the woods around them.  She is speaking, carefully,
     thoughtfully.  He listens with complete attention.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     She would tell me stories of
                     this woman and her lessons.  As
                     if complaining, or at least ex-
                     plaining her world...

     He shifts his position, his body brushing against hers, which makes
     him reflexively pull away.  She seems not to notice.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     But I always fantasized.  The
                     lessons were for me.

     INT. BEDROOM - DAY

     Hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror.  Mrs. Shigemura watching
     analytically, as Hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     No.  You must never look at a man
                     directly.  This is part of grace.

     The girl smiles a small sour smile.  Speaks quietly...

                               HATSUE
                     I don't think the boys on this
                     island.  Are impressed.  By grace.

     The old woman studies her without irritation.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue.

     Apparently, the girl has heard this before.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     This is why they fear death.  Because
                     life here is separate from Being.

     The girl takes a long pin.  Begins carefully to fasten her hair.
     Breaking eye contact with the mirror.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     It is why they have no soul.

     Is the girl even listening?  The old woman's voice never rises.
     Remains patient.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     Life embraces death, includes it.
                     This truth brings tranquility.  You
                     must see yourself...

                               HATSUE
                     ...as a leaf.  On a great tree.

     No irony in the girl's voice.  No disrespect.  The old woman reads
     the young face in the mirror.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     The pin.  Could be better placed.

     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - DAY

     CLOSE on 12-year-old Ishmael.  Neutral eyes.  Eating an apple.  A
     horrific CLANGING surrounds us.  The clash of metal on metal.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     My lessons came from my father.  They
                     were different.  Or seemed so, at the
                     time.

     See ARTHUR CHAMBERS now, at the printing press, an enormous lime
     green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast-
     iron housing.  The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient
     locomotive.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He operated the Review alone, with
                     an integrity and passion for principle
                     that made him a figure of respect.  If
                     slightly larger than life.

     Arthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun-metal rimmed
     spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves.  He wears the soft,
     perpetual smile of an Oxford Don, as he gracefully ducks in and
     out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He never spoke of wanting me to
                     succeed him.  And, in truth, it was
                     the last job on earth I thought I'd
                     ever want.

     The boy rises now.  Sets his apple carefully aside.  And under his
     father's supervision, takes his place operating the press.  His
     arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     When I was five, he casually mentioned
                     that if his sleeve got caught in the
                     press, he'd be instantly popped open
                     like a child's balloon, and splattered
                     across the walls.

     Watch Ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with
     complete concentration.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Even his bones would disappear, to
                     be discovered later on the floor,
                     as strips of white confetti.

     Arthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence.  Picks
     up the boy's apple.  A crisp BITE.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Which, of course, made me certain that
                     life would have no meaning until I
                     could run that teakettle.

     EXT. MAIN STREET, AMITY HARBOR - SUNSET

     Arthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of
     what seems a festive carnival.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He was, for better or worse, the
                     only God in my life.  I guess it's
                     our nature to resent those we know
                     we can never measure up to...

     They are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games.
     A genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races
     heedlessly mingling.  A community.  Arthur unselfconsciously slips
     his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...which keeps us from accepting
                     the warmth.  The way we should.

     Up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse.
     Something's up.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Every summer, after harvest, the
                     Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor-
                     ite story to cover.  Good news was
                     his preference.  Making him an oddity
                     among journalists.

     As we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the
     courthouse steps.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Highlight was crowning the Strawberry
                     Princess.  Always a Japanese girl,
                     sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
                     to the concept of racial harmony.

     We are there now.  Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael
     would use years later.  Focusing up at the MAYOR, as he places the
     crown on the radiant young girl...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Senior Year.  It was Hatsue.

     And as the applause ripples through the crowd.  As the Strawberry
     Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on...

     ...Ishmael.  She drops him a wink.  And a special wave.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     She winked at me.  In public.
                     Which was unusual.

     EXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY

     Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach.  Digging for clams in the mud.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I had kissed her once, when we
                     were ten.  Looking at fish through
                     a glass-bottomed box.  It was just
                     an impulse, and no big deal.

     Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to
     reach down.  We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in
     geoduck clam.

                               HATSUE
                     He's still got a good grip.  We
                     need to dig more.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     At school, she kept mostly to the
                     Japanese kids, and sort of ignored
                     me.  As if all of our times alone
                     together...in the hollow cedar,
                     everywhere...were a secret.

     They are digging now, together.  Carefully.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I told myself that was good.  That
                     it made our friendship special.  And
                     didn't mean she was ashamed of it.
                     Necessarily.

                               HATSUE
                     Easy.  Slow is best.

     Gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I thought about her.  Sometimes,
                     all the time.  I knew I was unhappy.
                     But I knew if I told her...

     She lifts it clear.  And as she admires its size and roughness with
     her fingertips.  As she washes it in the shallows.  He watches her
     movements.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It might be a mistake.  I could
                     never correct.

                               ISHMAEL (quietly)
                     I like you.

     The words make her turn.  Not startled, exactly.  Alerted.  But
     neutral, without affect.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Do you know what I mean, Hatsue?
                     I've always liked you.

     There is no answer.  He leans slightly closer, and she looks
     down.  This is the moment.  Afraid and driven, he moves slowly
     to her face.  And puts his mouth against hers.  She lets him and,
     encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue...

     ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to
     support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a
     long moment, before...

     ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the
     beach like a deer.  He stands slowly.  To watch her go.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I knew in my heart that we would
                     love each other forever.

     His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness.
     Contemplating this truth.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     The way she kissed me.  She knew
                     it, too.

     EXT. IMADA FARM - DUSK

     Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm, in near-darkness.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     She avoided me for a week.

     Across the distance, the screen door opens, light slips across the
     porch.  Hatsue appears with a wicker basket, to take the laundry
     from the line.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     So this way, I could see her
                     without...bothering anyone.

     He watches, rapt, as she unpins and folds the clothes, clenching
     the clothespins in her teeth.  Then reeling the line again, elegant
     hand over elegant hand...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I was certain everything would
                     work out.

     She corrals the long sweep of her hair, knotting it deftly, before
     heading inside.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     And frightened.

     EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAY

     Children working fields in sunlight.  Kneeling in the rows.  Hatsue
     with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly
     sheened with sweat.  She works with efficiency and grace, filling
     her flat.

     Three rows away.  Ishmael watches.  The fear not far beneath the
     surface of his quiet, dark features.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     By two weeks, I knew I had made
                     the defining mistake of my life.

     Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks
     DOWN rapidly at his work.  Cheeks burning, certain she is watching.
     Which she is not.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I'd ruined everything.

     LATER...end of day.  The young pickers turning in their flats as a
     gentle rain begins.  Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her
     pocket, and...

     ...runs lightly off, into the growing rain.  Ishmael sees.
     Stricken to his soul with longing.  And indecision.

     EXT. CEDAR GROVE - DAY

     Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of
     the hollow cedar.  The rain is driving now, and she glances up.
     At something we don't see.  And watches it.  Finally...

                               HATSUE
                     You followed me, huh?

     PULL BACK to see him.  Rain pelting off his poor soaked form.  She
     is waiting for an answer.  So...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Sorry.  It sort of...happened, I
                     just...I followed you.  I'm sorry.

     She pulls her hair behind her ears.  A movement which stretches her
     body.

                               HATSUE
                     I'm all wet.

     She starts refastening her hair now, looking away.  He comes
     inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can.  Which is
     close.  He watches her, watches her, and...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry I kissed you on
                     the beach.

     No reaction.  As if she hasn't heard.  Now his heart is beating
     straight through his chest.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Let's just forget about it.
                     Forget it happened.

     She picks up her damp straw hat.  And, eyes down, tracing a finger
     around its brim...

                               HATSUE
                     Don't be sorry.  I'm not sorry
                     about it.

     His heart bursts within him.  And he struggles to keep it from his
     face.  Even though she isn't watching.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Me neither.

     She turns her face to him, and offers a small smile.  It is
     genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy.  She lies back on
     the ground.  Her eyes so unafraid and direct.

                               HATSUE
                     Do you think this is wrong?

     He swallows.  Staring at her lying there so comfortably.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     The best part was that there was a
                     'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Your friends would.  Your dad would
                     kill me with a machete.

                               HATSUE
                     We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael.
                     He'll slice you up with a ceremonial
                     sword.

     Ah.  Better.  They are both grinning now.

                               HATSUE
                     My mom.  Would be the problem.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Why?  We're only talking.

     Her eyes flicker.  The synapse that a woman can offer a man.

                               HATSUE (softly)
                     Sure.

     And touches his hand.  With her fingertips.  The barest whisper...

                               HATSUE
                     I can't hear you.

     Thus invited, he leans down over Hatsue.  Kisses her mouth with all
     the tenderness in him.  This time, her eyes close gently.  And her
     body arches slightly, into his.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     We kissed for half an hour, that
                     first time.  And I knew there would
                     never be another day like it.

     Rain POUNDING now.  A curtain of water, sealing them from the
     world.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     No matter how long I lived.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on Ishmael, once more in the row of reporters.  Absently
     kneading the stump of his amputated arm.  The way some men drum
     their fingers.

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     ...you were acquainted with the
                     defendant and his family.

     ETTA HEINE is a linebacker in a dress.  Stout and German and wary.
     She is 57, and pulls her hem down tight below her knees.

                               ETTA
                     Him and his folks and two brothers
                     and two sisters worked our land.
                     Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

                               HOOKS
                     So the defendant knew the deceased,
                     your son, even then.

                               ETTA
                     They fished t'gether.  Went to school.
                     Carl Junior treated him like a white
                     person.  Like any friend.

     Said not with pride, but regret.

                               HOOKS
                     But the dispute began.  With the
                     father, yes?

     INT. HEINE FARMHOUSE - DAY

     Etta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor
     window, as her husband CARL SENIOR strools the strawberry fields
     with Kabuo's father Zenhichi.  Carl is a huge rawboned man, and
     puffs a pipe as Zenhichi stops, sweeps his arms this way and that.
     Etta knows trouble when she sees it.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATER

     Etta pours her husband's coffee.  It is very quiet.

                               ETTA
                     Don't sell, Carl.  You'll regret it.

                               CARL SR.
                     Only seven acres, and the worst
                     seven, at that.  They're decent
                     folks.  They got five hunnerd to
                     put down now.

                               ETTA
                     Don't go wavin' new church clothes
                     at me.  We're not such paupers as
                     sell to Japs, are we?  For what, a
                     pouch of fancy pipe tobacco?

     She walks about the kitchen with her arms folded.  Too upset to
     be still.

                               CARL SR.
                     They work hard, live clean, don't
                     spend nothin'.  Even kind to the
                     Indjuns.  People is people, comes
                     down to it.

     Etta turns sharply.  Glares at the big man.  He just blinks
     blandly, puffs his pipe.  She can see this ship has sailed.

                               ETTA
                     You wear the pants, doncha?  Go
                     ahead, sell our land to a Jap and
                     see what comes of it.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks pacing, slow and calm.  This part needs to be clear.

                               HOOKS
                     But back in '34, Japanese-born
                     could not own land.  So...?

                               ETTA
                     Carl held it for 'em.  Called it
                     a lease.  They make payments every
                     June and December...

                               HOOKS
                     Why?  If they could never take title.

                               ETTA
                     Their kids was born here.  So when
                     the oldest, that one there, was
                     twenty...last payment gets made,
                     and he could own it.

     She folds her hands.  Looks Kabuo square in the eye.

                               ETTA
                     But they missed their last two
                     payments.  So that was that.

     INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

     Carl Sr. and Zenhichi sit at the table.  There is coffee.  But it
     is untouched.  Etta watches by the stove.

                               ETTA (V.O.)
                     March 1942, orders came down.  Japs
                     had eight days before the Army was
                     gonna cart 'em off.

     Carl lights his pipe.  Compassion in his broad weathered face.

                               CARL SR. (softly)
                     Eight days.  It ain't right.

                               ZENHICHI
                     We must leave everything.  If you
                     like, you can work our fields, sell
                     berries, keep the money.  Otherwise,
                     they just rot.

                               ETTA (V.O.)
                     Japs are shrewd.  Offer berries he
                     can't use.  Soften us up about those
                     two payments still to come.

     And sure enough, Zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills.  Puts
     them on the table.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Today, I have $120 toward next paym...

                               CARL SR.
                     Absolutely not, Zenhichi.  I'm not
                     gonna take your savings at a time
                     like this.

     The small man spreads the bills out.  On the table.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Please, you take.  Then, I send more
                     from where I'm going.  If not enough,
                     you still have seven acres strawber...

                               ETTA
                     Thought you was givin' us those.

     And everything.  Stops.

                               ETTA
                     Didn't you come in here givin' them
                     away?  Now you want $130, after our
                     labor and fertilizer.  Is that what
                     you come here hopin' on?

     Zenhichi keeps his anger within.  His face is stone.

                               ETTA (V.O.)
                     I spit on him, and he's pretending
                     it didn't happen that way.  How could
                     anyone trust people like that?

                               ETTA
                     You want more coffee?

                               ZENHICHI
                     No, thank you.  Take money, please.

     But Carl is staring at his wife.  She stares right back.  Carl
     turns, slides the money toward Zenhichi.

                               CARL SR.
                     Etta's been rude to you, and I
                     apologize for that.  You keep this
                     money, and those payments will work
                     out fine.  Somewhere down the road.

     INT. PARLOR - TWILIGHT

     Silence.  Palpable.  Two figures sit at opposite ends of this
     darkening room, each under a lamp.  Carl Sr. is reading the paper.
     His face is stone.  Etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills
     and ledgers.  Her face is angry.

     A screen door opens.  Slams shut.  Big footfalls coming.  No one
     looks up.

                               CARL JR.
                     Look at this!

     He stands in the doorway.  A bamboo fishing road in his giant hand.

                               CARL JR.
                     Kabuo loaned it to me.  Til he
                     gets back.

     And his parents stare back him.

                               CARL JR.
                     It's great for sea-run cutthroat.
                     The ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped.

                               ETTA
                     Take that back.  And do it now.

     The big young face is stunned, hurt.

                               CARL JR.
                     I told Kabuo I'd take ca...

                               ETTA
                     Those Japs owe us.  I don't want
                     nothin' confusing that.

     The boy looks to his father.  Who says nothing.

                               ETTA
                     I said now, boy.  Supper's in
                     forty minutes.

     Crestfallen, defeated, the boy backs away.  Hear his footfalls.
     The screen door SLAM hard.

     And Carl Sr. looks at his wife.  No sound, until...

                               CARL SR.
                     We ain't right together.

     The words are flat and straight.  Etta stoic.

                               CARL SR.
                     You and me.  We just ain't right.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks settles back.  His butt on the edge of the prosecutor's
     table.  The soul of patience and clarity.

                               HOOKS
                     You said neither of the last two
                     payments were made.  But your husband
                     told defendant's father that he could
                     pay them...what, 'down the road'.

     And straight back...

                               ETTA
                     Road ended October 1944, when my
                     husband passed away.

     She nods.  That's all there was to it.

                               ETTA
                     I sold all the land to our
                     neighbor, Ole Jurgensen.  Got
                     a fair price, this time.  And...

     Straightens her spine.  To deliver the clincher...

                               ETTA
                     Sent all their equity back to those
                     Japs down in California.  Which I
                     didn't have to do.  Specially since
                     my boy was out in the Pacific, gettin'
                     shot at by Japs at the time.

     Hooks pauses.  As if drinking this in.

                               HOOKS
                     Now defendant's father had also
                     died by that point.  Where was
                     the defendant?  When you sent
                     his family their equity.

                               ETTA
                     In the war.  Europe, I believe.
                     They could hardly send him to the
                     Pacific, could they?

     Kabuo watching the woman.  Eyes as hard as her own.

                               HOOKS
                     And when he came home.  Did he
                     write you about this?  Or phone,
                     perhaps.

                               ETTA
                     Just showed up at my door, big as
                     life and twice as mean.  Wanted to
                     talk to my son.

     INT. ETTA'S APARTMENT, AMITY HARBOR - DAY

     Kabuo stands at the open door.  No one is inviting him inside.

                               ETTA
                     He's over the ocean, fighting the
                     Japs.  They're just about licked.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Just about.

     And there it sits.

                               ETTA
                     When Mr. Heine passed away, I
                     couldn't farm the place myself,
                     could I?  You're gonna have to talk
                     to Ole abou...

                               KABUO
                     I just did.  He didn't know we were
                     one payment away.  You didn't tell
                     him Mr. Heine promised my fath...

                               ETTA
                     I was s'posed to tell him there's
                     some illegal contract muddling things
                     up?  You folks didn't make your pay-
                     ments.  In America, bank comes in and
                     repossesses your land.  I didn't do
                     anything wrong.

     Kabuo stands.  Calm, unblinking.

                               KABUO
                     Nothing illegal.  Wrong is a
                     different mat...

                               ETTA
                     Get out of here.

                               KABUO
                     You sold our land out from under
                     us, Mrs. Heine.  You took advantage
                     of the fact that we were gone.  You...

     SLAMM.  The door has closed in his face.  And Kabuo stands there.
     As if deciding.

     Whether to break it down.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks standing at the jury box now.  Looking at them, as he asks...

                               HOOKS
                     What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?

                               ETTA
                     Well.  Every time I see him in
                     town or somewhere, he's starin'
                     at me with these narrow eyes.
                     Givin' me his mean face.

                               HOOKS
                     When your son came back from the
                     war, what did he say about all this?

                               ETTA
                     That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto.
                     Watch out for him.

                               HOOKS
                     Did he see some danger from defen...

                     Objection.  Asking witness to
                     speculate about deceased's state
                     of mind.

                               HOOKS
                     All right.  What did your son say
                     to that effect?

     She looks up.  As if trying to recall.

                               ETTA
                     He said he wished Kabuo would forget
                     about his seven acres, and stop
                     lookin' at us cross-eyed.

     Hooks stares at the jury.  Holds the moment.

                               HOOKS
                     Your witness.

     And goes slowly back to his seat.  Nels waits until his opponent is
     seated.  Then, rises.

                               NELS
                     Just three questions.  The Miyamoto
                     family bought your seven acres for
                     $4500?

                               ETTA
                     Tried to.  Defaulted on their
                     payments.

                               NELS
                     Second question.  What did Ole
                     Jurgensen pay you per acre?

                               ETTA
                     A thousand.

                               NELS
                     So that makes what would have been
                     $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If
                     you sent the equity back, you had
                     a profit of $2500.

                               ETTA
                     Is that your third question?

                               NELS
                     It is.

                               ETTA
                     You done your math right.

     The old man wears a thin, cold smile.

                               NELS
                     You, too.  No further questions.

     HOLD on Kabuo.  As he watches Etta rise heavily from the box.

     EXT. DEEP FOREST - FIRST LIGHT

     Mist of moments before dawn.  As tendrils part, there is enough
     light to see...

     ...eyes.  They are Asian.  They are razor-keen.  PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     ...Kabuo alone in G.I. gear and helmet.  Rifle up high, sweat
     on his face, moving soundlessly, turning in a circle as he goes,
     until...

     ...he stops.  A heartbeat of silence.  Then...

     ...the BLAST of automatic tracer TEARS through trees, as he WHIRLS
     and RETURNS FIRE in a single motion, until...

     Silence.

     His heart is pounding.  He waits.  Waits.  Weapon at the ready, he
     pushes THROUGH the dense foliage to see...

     ...the 15-year-old German SOLDIER, splayed on the forest floor, his
     chest torn and bloodied.  Kabuo's gaze LOCKS with the boy's.  The
     young soldier's empty left hand reaches out in a a plea, and as
     Kabuo steps forward, the boy's right hand comes suddenly...

     ...INTO view, metal GLINTING in motion, as Kabuo...

     ...BLOWS the boy AWAY with staccato rifle BURSTS that JUMP the
     already-lifeless body like an electric jolt.  And falling from the
     kid's hand, not a pistol, but...

     ...ID TAGS.

     No expression on Kabuo's face.  None at all.  He moves on.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     OLE JURGENSEN wobbles slightly in the witness box, hands resting on
     the cane planted unsteadily between his frail legs.  His eyes leak
     water, his beard is wispy and unkempt.

                     And then your stroke came this
                     summer.  And you put your property
                     on the market, I believe you said
                     September 7.  Which, remember, is

                     But Carl was a fisherman.  And

                     a farm.  He was sorry I got sick.
                     But pretty excited to get back his
                     father's place.

                               HOOKS
                     And later, that same day.  Only
                     eight days before Carl Heine died.
                     Did another prospective buyer appear?

     EXT. FARMHOUSE PORCH - DAY

     Ole sits in a wicker chair at a wicker table.  His wife LIESEL is
     setting out cold drinks.  But their visitor stands rigid,
     disbelieving.

                               LIESEL
                     I'm sorry to tell you, we took his

                     Come November, he'll sell his boat,
                     and take over the farm.

     Kabuo is thunderstruck.

                               KABUO
                     But your sign...

                     He just come ten o'clock.

     Kabuo nods.  His voice is soft, but his eyes are steel.

                               KABUO
                     It's my fault.  I should have come
                     earlier.

     He looks so odd, perhaps he's ill.  Liesel looks concerned.

                               OLE
                     If you want t'buy them seven

     INT. COURTROOM - EVENING

     The witness box is empty.  The snow outside the windows is falling
     in darkness.  And Judge Lew Fielding is leaning his frame toward
     the jurors...

                     I apologize for keeping you folks
                     from your families in a storm like
                     this.  I do hope you'll be reasonably

                     anniversary of the attack on Pearl
                     Harbor.

     Slight pause.  To make sure they are listening.

                               JUDGE
                     Which has no relationship to this
                     trial.  Which is why I mention it.

     Gavel CRACKS down.

                               JUDGE
                     10 o'clock tomorrow, folks.  Stay
                     warm.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

     Hatsue walks briskly down the crowded hallway, her eyes searching
     the benches lining the corridor ahead.  Her view obscured by the
     crowd hurrying to fight the storm.  Suddenly...

     ...she stops.  Because there.  On a bench.  Sits Ishmael.  Next to
     him, a round Japanese-American baby boy of 11 months.  Before him,
     squat the boy's sisters, eight and four.  All are watching
     Ishmael...

     ...manipulating a COIN.  It rolls across his knuckles and back
     again, with amazing dexterity.  Then, he snatches it into his palm.
     Holds up his fist.  All little eyes are glued.  The fist...

     ...opens.  It is EMPTY.  There are GASPS.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Know where it is?

     They don't.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's in my other hand.

     The four-year-old LAUGHS.  Her big sister socks her.  And Mom steps
     in.  The man looks up, with the sweetest smile.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Your mother went to the bathroom.
                     She said I could show them a trick.

                               FOUR-YEAR-OLD
                     HE DOESN'T HAVE A OTHER HAND!

     Hatsue is not smiling.  Nor is she angry.  Even awkward comes to
     her in a graceful way.  She scoops up her son.

                               HATSUE
                     Thank you for your help.
                           (to the girls)
                     Let's go find obaasan.

     And without even glancing at him, she heads off at a brisk pace.
     The girls following.  The four-year-old turning back to wave once.

     And then they are gone.

     INT. JAIL - NIGHT

     Kabuo stands outside the open steel door of his tiny cell, as Abel
     Martinson clumsily unfastens the manacles.  A cot, a toilet without
     a seat, a bare bulb hanging from a wire.  No windows to the outside
     world.  Only the small barred one in the cell door.  As the
     manacles fall away...

     ...Abel removes two objects from his pocket.

                               ABEL
                     This is from Nels, I can't see the
                     harm.  Don't tell Art, okay?

     Hands him two CANDY BARS.  A Snickers.  And a Baby Ruth.  Kabuo
     looks at them...

     In spite of himself.  Kabuo smiles.  Remembering...

     INT. JAIL - DAY

     Kabuo sits in jailhouse overalls on the edge of his cot.  Motion-
     less.  On a private journey of the mind.  The door CLANGS open...

                               MORAN
                     This here is Nels Gudmundsson,
                     he's your attorney.

     Kabuo looks over.  That flat, unsmiling gaze.  The old man has a
     folded chessboard and a Havana cigar box under his arm.  Their eyes
     lock, as if the Sheriff weren't even here.  And Moran leaves,
     closing the door with respectful quiet.

     Nels doesn't smile, doesn't speak.  Opens the chessboard on the
     cot.  Opens the cigar box filled with chess pieces, two cigars,
     a Snickers and a Baby Ruth.  He puts the candy bars by Kabuo's
     pillow, a silent gift.  Begins to set up the chessboard.

                               KABUO
                     What makes you think I play?

                               NELS
                     Your daddy played.  I asked, down
                     at the Japanese Community Center.
                     You smoke cigars?

     And offers one up, rough and black.

                               KABUO
                     I'm not sure.  I better check
                     down at the Center.

     Kabuo smiles only with his eyes.  Nels nods, maybe you better.
     Lights his own cigar.  Puts the matches and the other cigar at
     Kabuo's side.

                               NELS
                     White or black?

                               KABUO
                     You mean, do I like to take the
                     offensive?  Or hang back and wait.

     That seems answer enough for Nels.  He turns the board around to
     where he has white, and makes the first move.

                               NELS
                     Nice.  When two fellas understand
                     each other.

     Kabuo picks up the cigar.  STRIKES a match.

     ...........................................................
     white.  Kabuo moves a black bishop.  Nels' eyes shoot around the
     table.  He reaches and KNOCKS OVER Kabuo's black king.  Kabuo
     blinks, studies the board silently.  Then smiles.

     He unwraps the Snickers bar.  Breaks it in half.  Hands one piece
     across to his lawyer.

     SERIES OF ANGLES...

     RAPID CUTS, different days, Nels in different suits, chess pieces
     in different positions, each time Nels reaching to topple Kabuo's
     king.  The last time...

     Kabuo has to study the board for a beat.  Shakes his head.

                               KABUO
                     You must think I like losing.

                               NELS
                     I think you like learning.

     And leans his old bones back against the hard wall.

                               NELS
                     Me, too.  That's why I come.

     Pulls out two cigars.  Kabuo looks at them.

                               NELS
                     Bet there's a few things you
                     could teach me.  Kendo, for one.

                               KABUO
                     Sure.  I could take a fishing
                     gaff and split your head open.
                     Right above your left ear.

     No smile.  Steady gaze.

                               KABUO
                     You wouldn't even see it move.

                               NELS
                     You're wonderin'...how come I
                     never ask.  If you did it.

     Hands one cigar.  Across the chessboard.

                               NELS
                     Now, you've told me you killed
                     four men.  In Germany.  So I know
                     you are the kind of man who can
                     kill.  When there's a reason.

                               KABUO (very quiet)
                     Guess I am.

     Takes the cigar.  Rolls it between his thumb and forefinger.

                               NELS
                     You feel guilty.  That you took
                     their lives.  That's in your eyes.

     STRIKES a match.

                               NELS (softly)
                     Jury sees what I see.  More often
                     than not.

     Reaches stiffly.  Kabuo bends toward him.  Accepts the flame.
     Takes a puff.

                               NELS
                     Prosecutor thinks.  What was
                     your reason?  To kill Carl Heine.

     Kabuo says not a word.

                               NELS
                     Well, there is the land itself.
                     Raise your children where you
                     were raised.  Sleep with your
                     wife at night, 'stead of bein'
                     alone on the sea.

     Brings the match to his own cigar.  Careful.  Expert.

                               NELS
                     There's fairness and honor.  You
                     were cheated by that old bitch.
                     Boy, she is something.

                               KABUO (simply)
                     She's not alone.

     Worlds within those words.

                               NELS (a murmur)
                     None of us are.

     And in those.

                               NELS
                     And prejudice, like you say.  Your
                     people locked in a concentration
                     camp.  You go off to fight for our
                     country's freedom.  Come back to this.

     Shakes his head.

                               NELS
                     But Mr. Hooks has missed the one
                     reason.  One reason.  You coulda
                     done it.

     A flicker.  Behind the defendant's eyes.

                               NELS
                     I read you Etta Heine's deposition.
                     So I could watch your mind.  Like I
                     do when you move your rook, or when
                     I move mine.

     A smile now.  Very kind.  Very sad.

                               NELS
                     And you weren't thinking about her.
                     Or about land.  Or about you.

     No, you weren't.  And in the gentlest voice...

                               NELS
                     No, someone cheats you, you can
                     rise above that.  You're a family
                     man.  You put them ahead of you, hmmn?

     He sighs.  But...

                               NELS
                     Wasn't you she dishonored.

     And the old watering eyes are rock steady now.

                               NELS
                     Your father was a strong and
                     tireless man.  Honest to a fault.
                     Kind, and humble as well...

     There is a silence.  And then...

                               KABUO (real quiet)
                     Nice.  When two fellas.  Understand
                     each other.

     They let that sit.

                               NELS
                     Now this jury is gonna be lookin'
                     at the evidence with one eye.
                     And at you with the oth...

                               KABUO
                     Mr. Gudmundsson, we know what
                     that jury is looking at.

     He won't let hs eyes lie to this man.

                               NELS
                     Your father needs you.  To return
                     to your family.

     Silence.

                               NELS
                     So every time you think about
                     showing that jury strength.  Or
                     honor or composure.  Or dignity.

                               KABUO
                     I should show them an American?

     Nels sees the rage.  It breaks his heart.  It makes him feel old
     and helpless.

                               NELS
                     Show them an innocent man.

     What he stares at now.  Is a neutral mask.  As powerful and opaque
     as the voice is quiet.

                               KABUO
                     Shame you couldn't play chess with
                     my dad, sir.  He'd kick your ass.

     INT. ISHMAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Through glass, snow is tumbling in endless cascades, the world
     dwarfed by a descending heaven.  A sound, a strange soft CLICK.
     PAN across...

     ...the small, well-kept bachelor apartment.  Neat stacks of books
     on the floor, catching the overflow of shelves crammed full.
     Someone likes to read.  Another soft CLICK.  To...

     ...the kitchen now, along the floor.  An awkward high-top SHOE, its
     buckled straps above elastic LACES that fasten across the instep.
     The shoe steps on a crude wooden PEDAL.  And we hear another CLICK.
     PAN up along a vertical strip of mesh WIRE to...

     ...a plywood CONTRAPTION, held by a partially closed drawer.  A
     piece of spring steel holding a set of NAIL CLIPPERS.

     Ishmael inserts his pinkie carefully.  CLICK.  Finishes clipping
     the fingernails of his only hand.  And looks out.  At the magic of
     white.

     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY

     Safe within their haven, the 18-year-olds kiss and hold each other
     urgently.  Their tongues exploring each other's mouth, her legs
     open beneath her skirt, pressing her body up against him.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I gave her all of my soul to love.
                     I knew someday we would live in
                     France.  Italy.  Somewhere.  Far
                     from the things that upset her.

     ANGLE...later, they lie so quietly.  Her head nestled in the crook
     of his arm, he gently plays with her hair.  Her face so still, so
     thoughtful and grave.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     You don't have to be so tragic,
                     you know.

     Ah.  Her dark eyes flicker.

                               HATSUE (dry)
                     Kind of magical, the way you know
                     how to comfort a girl.

     She cuts the irony by sending her fingertips to stroke his.

                               HATSUE
                     I can just feel my spirits soar.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well, I don't do it for just
                     anybody.

     And kisses her head.  But her eyes still stare off into the tangle
     of her worries.  He draws a breath...

                               ISHMAEL
                     There can't be any wrong in
                     this, Ha...

                               HATSUE
                     I lie to my parents every day.
                     And every night.

     His light tone against the fear...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well.  Since I never told your
                     folks, I guess I'm lying to 'em,
                     too.  But you don't hear me
                     complaining about it.

     She winds her fingers with his.  Loyalty against her doubt.
     Very soft with...

                               HATSUE
                     I'm in awe.  Of your strength.

     INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

     Hatsue sits with the Japanese kids.  Ishmael with his friends.  The
     bus filled with stone-faced teenagers listening to the DRIVER, who
     brandishes his newspaper at the Japanese side of the bus...

                               DRIVER
                     ...not just Pearl, they're attackin'
                     all over the Pacific, the whole
                     fleet's destroyed.  The FBI's in
                     Seattle right now...

     And pauses.  His eyes moving from one Japanese face to the next.
     Are you listening?

                               DRIVER
                     ...arresting Jap traitors, the
                     spies and everything.  There'll
                     be a blackout tonight, so keep your
                     radios off.  So the Japs don't pick
                     up no signals.  You get the message?

     Stares them down.  Until, from across the bus...

                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)
                     Hey, Mr. Lamberson, over here!

     The driver's eyes snap around.  The tall boy is waiting.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I have a radio, too.  Don't you
                     want to be sure I got the message?

     Ishmael sees the anger.  He's not afraid of it.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Just checking.

     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - LATE NIGHT

     The horrid CLANGING of the great rattletrap press, Arthur Chambers
     ducking nimbly among the rollers.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It was a special edition, an extra.
                     My father wrote, 'These people are
                     our neighbors, they have sent their
                     sons to the United States Army...'

     Print flying onto paper as it rolls through the green metal
     gauntlet.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     'They are no more an enemy than
                     our fellow islanders of German or
                     Italian descent.'

     Belary-eyed Ishmael, pulling finished copies from the bin.  As
     he stacks them for delivery, he reads aloud, above the CLASH of
     metal...

                               ISHMAEL (sleepy and loud)
                     LET US SO LIVE THAT, WHEN IT IS OVER,
                     WE CAN LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE.
                     AND KNOW WE HAVE ACTED HONORABLY.

     Big yawn.  It's really late.  He turns, and sees...

     ...his father.  Staring at him.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I guess courage never inspires the
                     young.  Until the danger of it bites
                     their butt.

     EXT. WOODS - TWILIGHT

     They walk slowly up the path.  An arm around each other's waist,
     their bodies brushing as they go...

                               HATSUE
                     My father can't get our money from
                     the bank.  We have a few dol...

                               ISHMAEL
                     It'll be over soon.  I can get
                     you money.

     She stops.  By a weathered fence, covered in vines.  It's growing
     dark.

                               HATSUE
                     It's not going to get better, okay?

     She sighs.  He moves close, looks so grave.

                               HATSUE
                     They arrested Mr. Shirazaki,
                     because his farm is near a navy
                     transmitter.  And his family can't
                     leave their house.

     What can he say.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's just Pearl Harbor.  People
                     are a little crazy, right n...

                               HATSUE
                     Look at my face.  It's the face of
                     the people who did that.  My father
                     hardly speaks English.  We're in
                     bad trouble, you have to see that.

     He reaches.  Touches this face that he loves with all his heart.
     Forces up a smile.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe we can fix your eyes.

     She leans up.  CROSSES her eyes in a goofy expression.  Then kisses
     his mouth.  When she pulls back...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Don't let this hurt us, okay?
                     Whatever happens.

     And she studies this boy.  Knowing more than he can ever
     understand.  And chooses to whisper...

                               HATSUE
                     It won't.  You'll see.

     INT. IMADA FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

     Hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table, as
     snow drifts down beyond the window.  Plates and flatware.  Glasses
     and napkins.  Slowly, in silence, as if a ritual bonding mother and
     daughter.  She glances to the next room...

     ...her mother Fujiko plays with the babies.  Her father HISAO reads
     the paper.  Smoking his pipe.

     And Hatsue is motionless for a moment.  Watching him.

     INT. IMADA FARMHOUSE - DAY

     CLOSE on Hatsue at 18, staring with silent anger greater than her
     fear.

                               HISAO (O.S. shaky)
                     We are loyal.

     PULL BACK to see the room.  Hatsue and her sisters side by side,
     staring at the table.  On it rests a shotgun, four boxes of shells,
     a ceremonial sword.  An FBI AGENT, a small man in a dark suit, is
     tagging each item.  He wears a light, perpetual, insincere smile.

                               FUJIKO
                     Everyone on the island has
                     these things.

     Fujiko at her husband's side.  She is quietly indignant.  He is
     frightened.

                               AGENT (overly casual)
                     Well, they'll hold this stuff for
                     a little bit, then ship it back to
                     you.  It's nothing to worry about.

     And walks over to the tansu, a chest of drawers, and begins to
     remove items...

                               AGENT
                     You folks have been real polite,
                     and we'll be outta your hair in
                     just a second...

     ...a silk kimono with gold brocaded sash...

                               AGENT
                     That's very nice.  From the old
                     country, it appears.  Very high class.

     And lays it on another table.  Next to a bamboo flute, a stack of
     shakuhachi sheet music.

                               AGENT
                     These are real nice things.
                     They'll take special care of 'em.

     Hisao sees his wife's sudden alarm.  And, as respectfully as he can
     manage...

                               HISAO
                     The flute is precious.  The kimono,
                     the music.  Must you take th...

                               AGENT
                     ...oh yeh, any old country stuff,
                     we have to take.

     And sees on the sofa, an open album.  Strolls over.

                               FUJIKO
                     This is only my daughter's
                     scrapbook.  For her memories.

     So he picks it up.  Doesn't see Hatsue stiffen with repulsion, as
     he wanders, thumbing through it, toward the hallway...

                               AGENT (calling out)
                     Wilson?  Don't go pawing through
                     the underwear!

     And chuckles.  He knows they appreciate a joke.  It means there's
     nothing to be afraid of.  Stops turning pages now.  Looks up, his
     eyes moving until they find Hatsue.

                               AGENT
                     Strawberry Princess, huh?  You
                     musta been flattered by that.
                     Looks just like y...

     The soft slamming of a screen door.  Another AGENT, large and
     shambling in his too-small suit, is carrying a crate.  And a
     telling look.

                               AGENT #2 (quiet triumph)
                     Dynamite.  Twenty-four sticks.

     And the crate BANGS onto the table.  Just beside the kimono.  Lifts
     out two sticks and holds them high.  Proof.

                               HISAO
                     You must believe.  This for tree
                     stumps.  For clearing land.

     The small man's smile fades now.  First time.  And his eyes fix
     Hisao before he speaks.  As if reading his mind.

                               AGENT
                     Maybe.  Maybe.  But this is still
                     bad, y'see.

     Fujiko slips her hand into her husband's.  To give him strength.

                               AGENT
                     It's illegal contraband, you were
                     s'posed to turn this stuff in.
                     We, uh...

     Slight shrug.

                               AGENT
                     We gotta arrest you.  Have to
                     take you to Seattle.

     Fujiko's breath catches.  One of the daughters whimpers.  The
     silence hangs thick and frightening.  The bigger agent unhooks a
     pair of handcuffs from his belt, but...

                               AGENT
                     Naw, you don't need those.  Mister
                     Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act,
                     a real gentleman.

     The younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters.  The
     agent regrets this.

                               FUJIKO
                     Please, reconsider.  He has done
                     no bad th...

                               AGENT
                     Well, nobody knows that yet, do
                     they?  So, best for an honest man
                     to clear his name for godd and all.

     Ain't that right?

                               AGENT
                     Only a few questions in Seattle,
                     okay?  Few questions, few answers,
                     the whole thing is over.

     He puts his hand on Hisao's arm.  Not roughly, but much firmer than
     the ease of his voice...

                               AGENT
                     Simple as that.

     INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Eight pages of a letter, carefully written in Kanji characters,
     folded neatly on a table.

                               FUJIKO (O.S.)
                     Why do I read you this distres-
                     sing letter?  From your father.
                     From this hakujin...work camp, it
                     is called.  In Montana.

     PULL BACK to see mother and five daughters around the table.  Even
     the youngest girls somber, attentive.  As if they have aged these
     past few weeks.

                               FUJIKO
                     Because you need to know the
                     darkness.  In the hearts of the
                     hakuj...

                               HATSUE (blurts)
                     Not all of them.

     The silent wake of her outburst, her interruption, lingers.  Her
     mother studies her.

                               FUJIKO
                     The whites are enslaved by their egos,
                     Hatsue.  Each believes his aloneness
                     is everything.  We seek union wi...

                               HATSUE
                     ...the ones seeking union with the
                     Greater Life bombed Pearl Harbor.
                     They are not humble.  I am not part
                     of them, I'm part of here.

     Her voice so loud, so insistent.  Her sisters are afraid for her.
     To have shown such disrespect.  They look down at their hands.  Or
     away, as if not hearing.

                               FUJIKO (quietly, slowly)
                     I see this.  This lack of purity
                     is a mist around your soul.  I see
                     it every day, it haunts your face
                     in unguarded moments.

     The room is still as the grave.  The mother's eyes burn silently.

                               FUJIKO
                     I see it in your eagerness to
                     leave here.  And walk the woods.
                     In the afternoon.

     What does she know?  Hatsue's heart pounding.  And to her surprise,
     her mother's voice softens...

                               FUJIKO
                     If you lose your true self, Hatsue.
                     True self...

     The stern warning, the unrelenting judgement, has become a plea.

                               FUJIKO
                     There is no way back.

     INT. ISHMAEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Ishmael washing his supper plate.  His fork and knife.  His coffee
     mug.  His skillet.  Hard labor with one hand.  And as he works, he
     looks at...

     ...the window above his sink.  Darkness and moonlit snow.  And his
     own reflection.  CLOSE on his face in the glass, and MATCH DISSOLVE
     to...

     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - NIGHT

     ...Arthur Chambers.  Weary.  Worn behind the smile of knowing ease,
     as he sips coffee from a mug of his own.

     His boy sits across from him in the silent press room.  Feet up,
     reading their paper.  Its headline, ISLAND JAPANESE ACCEPT ARMY
     MANDATE TO MOVE.

                               ISHMAEL
                     See, you bring it on yourself.
                     23 ladies honored by the PTA, you
                     single out three names.  And they're
                     all Japanese.  That isn't journalism.

                               ARTHUR (quietly)
                     Because...?

     Ishmael has heard this gently prodding word all his life.  He
     sighs.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Because journalism.  Is just the
                     facts.

                               ARTHUR
                     Which facts?  You can't print
                     them all.  Journalism is balance.
                     Finding the facts folks need to know.

     The boy looks dryly at his father.  SLAPS the page with the back of
     his hand.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Hence.  The letters.

     Arthur closes his eyes.  Recites from memory...

                               ARTHUR
                     'Seems like you're favoring the Japs,
                     Art.  Writin' all about their
                     patriotism and loyalty with nothin'
                     'bout the treachery.'

     A smile in the voice.  A sad one.

                               ARTHUR
                     'Your newspaper is an insult to
                     all white Americans.  Please cancel
                     my subscription and send refund.'

     Now the smile is on his face.  Even sadder.

                               ARTHUR
                     The calls are better. 'Jap lovers
                     get their balls cut off and stuffed
                     down their...'
                              (shrugs)
                     Missed the rest.  Hanging up will
                     do that.

     Silence.  Two men.  Watching each other.

                               ARTHUR
                     We lost the Price-Rite ads.  And
                     Lottie Opsvig's shop, and Larsen's
                     Lumberyard and the Anacortes Cafe.
                     And 30 percent of our subscribers.

     A deeper silence.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Integrity is expensive stuff, huh?

                               ARTHUR
                     Valuable things.  Sometimes are.

     Toasts his son.  With coffee.

                               ARTHUR
                     But.  I've got the answer.

     A wink.  A swallow of Joe.

                               ARTHUR
                     Print four pages.  Instead
                     of eight.

     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DUSK

     They lie so close.  Their bodies touching, not moving.  Their faces
     inches apart, so that every word is a murmur...

                               HATSUE
                     You're like me.  You've learned
                     to be devious.

     He's never seen her this fragile, this scared.  He knows he has to
     be strong for her.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's not devious, it's what we have
                     to do.  You're leaving tomorrow...

     He unties her hair.  So gently.  Tries to keep his smile calm,
     steady...

                               ISHMAEL
                     You write to my house, and put
                     Kenny Yamashita's name on the
                     return address.  It's no big deal.

     He brings his face to her hair.  Kisses it.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You smell like cedar.

     Her eyes are wide.  They move over his face.  A murmured...

                               HATSUE
                     So do you.  It's your smell I'll
                     miss as much as anything.

     He looks in her eyes.  And words come from his heart, before he can
     stop them...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Let's get married, okay?

     Her eyes fill with tears.  Are they from happiness?

                               ISHMAEL
                     I want to marry you.  Is that okay?

     Her face so still.  One tear falls, and he kisses it.

                               ISHMAEL (a whisper)
                     Just say yes.

     No answer.  Not knowing what to say, she winds an arm behind his
     head, and brings him nearer.  His mouth opens into hers, with more
     force, more of his heart, than he has ever given.  Deep and tender.
     His hands reach beneath her dress...

     ...peel her panties down her thighs...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     When something that means your
                     whole life.  Is the last time ever...

     And suddenly, he is OVER her, drawing her legs up around him...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     God should tell you.  Or it's not
                     fair.

     Her head tilts back, her eyes squeeze closed.  And as he enters
     her...

                               ISHMAEL (whispers)
                     Please say yes...

     ...her hands GRASP his upper arms.  And push away.

                               HATSUE (softly)
                     No.

     And he blinks.  As if waking from a dream.  Everything has stopped.
     Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret.

                               HATSUE
                     No.  No.  It isn't right.

     So he draws away.  Stunned, uncomprehending.  Watching with blank
     eyes, as she stares up at him.  Then, with dignity and tenderness,
     he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...

                               ISHMAEL
                     It felt right to me.  It felt
                     like getting married.

     She draws her legs up.  Kneeling now, putting her hands on his
     face...

     But no words come.  No words.  Until...

                               HATSUE
                     I'll write you.

     And KISSES him fiercely, and BOLTS up before he can grab her,
     RUNNING off like a deer, while he...

     ...kneels.  His mouth open.  Like a silent scream.

     EXT. AMITY HARBOR FERRY - MORNING

     An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air.
     Hesitantly, looking in all directions, Fujiko, Hatsue, and her four
     sisters climb from the truck, to see...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     On Monday, March 30, 1942, the
                     United States Army graciously
                     transported the Imada women to
                     the docks.

     ...a ferry, the KEHLOKEN, stands waiting.  Soldiers are dis-
     tributing tags for luggage and coats.  The evacuees, mostly women,
     stand in the cold, trying to smile bravely for each other.  And
     lined against the railing...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Lifelong neighbors came to watch.
                     Curiosity masked as kindness...

     ...a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors
     file toward the ferry.  A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who
     casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting.  And
     just as they reach the gangway...

     ...Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance,
     among a group of students.  She pauses.  Her eyes hold his for a
     heartbeat...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...with some exceptions.

     The wisp of a smile.  And she is gone.

     EXT. IMADA FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

     Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch.  Snow is no
     longer falling.  She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively.
     The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain
     impenetrability of her Asian exterior.  She closes her eyes, and...

     ...draws deep on the smoke.  The act seems to cause her pain.  When
     the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded.  Nowhere to turn.
     The next puff looks desperate, and she FLIPS the cigarette out onto
     the snow.  Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her
     feet against the cold, the helplessness.  And looks out...

     ...strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered
     moonlight, become...

     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT

     ...a moonlit DESERT.  PAN the barbed wire, the distant barracks,
     the desolation.  Come to...

     ...two women walking alone.  The younger one glancing at her mother
     as they go.  Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead.
     The barracks, everything, in distance behind them.

                               HATSUE
                     You think we're far enough
                     away now?

     No sarcasm in the voice.  She lets the words carry her irony.
     Her mother stops.  Looks at her so directly, so strong.  Even her
     tough-minded daughter flinches slightly.

                               HATSUE
                     Mom, whatever this is, they don't
                     keep war secrets this carefully.

     Fujiko thinks that over.  Nods.

                               FUJIKO
                     Secrets are hard to keep.

     She goes over to a large, flat rock.  Sits down.  Pulls two sheets
     of paper from her coat.  And waits.  As her daughter comes and
     crouches at her feet.  Fujiko clears her throat.

                               FUJIKO
                     This letter.  Was opened.
                     By mistake.

     And watches.  As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask.
     Silence.  Then...

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'My love.  I still go to our
                     cedar tree in the afternoons every
                     day.  I shut my eyes, waiting.'

     Hatsue has turned to stone.  To ice.  Wind blows.

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'I smell your smell.  And I dream
                     of you.  And I ache for you to come
                     home.  So I can hold you and feel
                     you near.'

     Fujiko scans the page silently.  Turns to the second...

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'After all these years that we've
                     been together, I find you're a
                     part of me.  Without you, I have
                     nothing.  All my love, forever...'

     And looks up.  Her eyes calm, quiet.

                               FUJIKO
                     The neighborhood boy.  Who taught
                     you to swim?

     The look holds.  And holds.

                               HATSUE
                     You shouldn't have opened that.
                     It was mi...

                               FUJIKO (so quiet)
                     How deceitful of me.

     Anger only at the edges.  Like finely-honed steel.

                               FUJIKO
                     How can I ever hope.  For your
                     forgiveness.

     The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them.  They seem not to
     notice.

                               FUJIKO
                     I have written this letter to
                     the boy's parents...

     She pulls out a single page.  Hands it down to her daughter.
     Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words.

                               FUJIKO
                     Attraction is no crime, certainly
                     among children.  The dishonor
                     lies in the concealment.  From
                     your families.

     Watches her daughter reading.  And quietly...

                               FUJIKO
                     I know that you know this.  I know
                     you have suffered.  Even if the
                     hakujin could not.

     Silence.  Hatsue's eyes cast down.  She folds the page.

                               FUJIKO
                     There will be no further letters.
                     No contact of any k...

     And stops.  Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two.  She looks
     up.  Into her mother's shock.

                               HATSUE
                     One more letter.  I will write
                     it.  You may read it, and send
                     it for me.

     Her mother's anger fades.  Into interest.

                               HATSUE
                     I deceived more than you.  I
                     deceived this sweet boy.  And
                     myself.  It was never love.

     Never love.  The mother's face changes.  There is understanding,
     acceptance.  Even pride.

                               HATSUE
                     I will work hard.  To earn your
                     forgiveness.

     A sigh.  A sadness deep, beyond her years.

                               HATSUE
                     I can never hope for his.

     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Mother and daughter enter their crude quarters.  They find Hatsue's
     sisters sitting on the wooden floor, watching...

     ...a team of young MEN, working with tools and pieces of lumber.
     One is building shelves, two others, a chest of drawers.  Their
     leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the
     floor.  One girl beams at her mother...

                               SUMIKO
                     These boys are buildings us
                     a mansion!

     The leader grins and rises.  Bows slightly to Fujiko.  He is, of
     course...

                               KABUO
                     I'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada.

     The woman smiles.  Bows slightly in return.

                               FUJIKO
                     We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san.
                     How are your parents, your family...?

                               KABUO
                     My father is sick with the camp
                     food.  The rest of us are fine.
                     Don't speak of dept, please, we
                     just want to help.

     And glances.  To the eldest daughter.  In the doorway.

                               KABUO
                     Hi, Hatsue, remember me?

     She looks back, without expression.  There is much on her mind.
     His smile is handsome, easy.

                               KABUO
                     I was a senior when you were a
                     junior.  But I've seen you around.

     She tosses her hair free of the parka.  Gathers it in her hands.
     Saying only...

                               HATSUE
                     Hello.

     Can't win a smile, but he doesn't seem to mind.

                               KABUO
                     Nice to see you.

     EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE REAR PORCH - NIGHT

     Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch.  He draws from
     his coat a black CIGAR.  Box of matches.  The cigar goes into his
     mouth.  With amazing dexterity...

     ...he slips a single match from the box, turns his face to the
     wall, and still palming the box, STRIKES a match on the buckle of
     his belt, bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical
     puffs before the match dies.  He turns toward...

     ...the fields.  Stretching treeless, endless, seemingly to the
     horizon.  Bathed in filtered moonlight, they become...

     EXT. TARAWA ATOLL - NIGHT

     ...the shimmering Pacific.  We are with Ishmael in an LCVP landing
     craft, as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon.  Bobbing past two
     DESTROYERS firing in waves at the beach.  Ishmael and his platoon
     mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw
     fire on the sand, one exploding in flame.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Her letter reached me on the North
                     Island of New Zealand.  So I had a
                     month to think it over...

     Men around him are shouting, cursing, jostling against each other,
     frightened out of their minds, as SHELLS POUND the ocean, horrify-
     ingly huge and near.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I wrote her four times.  'I hate
                     you with all my heart.  I hate you,
                     Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'

     Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef.  They are
     still 300 yards from shore.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I never sent the letters.  I wanted
                     to kill as many Japs as possible.

                               SQUAD LEADER
                     MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT,
                     LET'S GO!!

     The SQUAD LEADER goes over the side, Ishmael and others follow,
     struggling with 85 pound packs.  As Ishmael hits the water, the
     squad leader is SHOT in the face, a man five yards from Ishmael has
     the top of his head BLOWN AWAY, men are DROPPING in numbers under
     the WITHERING BURSTS of fire, the deafening ordnance sweeping over
     the SHRIEKS of terror and agony, and Ishmael...

     ...submerges behind his pack, splashing hard, keeping its bulk
     ahead of him as a shield, until he can wade and swim and plunge
     toward shore, as hellfire CRASHES everywhere, dead bodies floating,
     machine-gun blasts WHIPPING the water's surface, Ishmael at...

     ...the shallows now, men rising to make a run at the seawall, being
     CUT DOWN, Ishmael crouching in the water, watching other men draw
     fire, and in a moment's lull, four of them and Ishmael...

     ...GO for it, lungs BURSTING, pounding MADLY up the sand, one
     SHOT DEAD, another SCREAMS as his knee is blown away and goes down
     writhing, as three men...

     ...MAKE IT to the wall.  Gasping, puking, shivering with cold and
     fright.  They have no gear, no weapons.  One of them is Ishmael.
     He looks back to...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death.
                     Thirty yards away.

     Bullets FLYING everywhere, CHEWING up the sand.  The young man
     twitching, pleading...

                               BLEDSOE (crying)
                     Oh, shit, please, please help me
                     you guys, come on, help me, fucking
                     help me, PLEASE...!

     And flat against the seawall, three men watch.  Not daring to look
     at each other.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I knew nothing could save him.  Hell,
                     I didn't have so much as a band-aid.
                     I also knew I was a coward.  For not
                     giving up my life to try.

     EXT. SEAWALL - DAY

     Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others.  Sixty or
     so men mill in the shadow of the seawall.  The beach is littered
     with dead marines and wounded, calling for help.  As Ishmael
     glances up, a SERGEANT leaps ONTO the seawall, cigarette dangling
     from his mouth...

                               SERGEANT
                     You pussies are the kinda chickenshits
                     deserve to have your balls chewed
                     off real slow when this is over!

     Stands with his hands on his hips.  The men below him properly
     mesmerized.

                               SERGEANT
                     Any man who won't follow me over
                     this wall is a cornhole-fucker with
                     a half-inch hard-on wh...

     The words CUT OFF by the shell that RIPS THROUGH his spine, OPENING
     his shirt front as he PITCHES forward FLAT upon the sand.

     No one looks.  No one speaks.  It never happened.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I wanted to live.  And I didn't
                     know why.

     EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

     Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete.  PULL BACK to reveal
     300 MARINES all down the wall, a striking force assembled from the
     survivors of multiple landings.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Some colonel came down the beach.
                     Any man who didn't go over the wall
                     at 2100 would be court-martialed,
                     disgraced and imprisoned...

     Every man lining up now, rifles at the ready.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     The captain who followed said shot
                     on sight.

     They seem more resigned, or is it stunned numb, than terrified.
     There is no interaction.  Each man dealing with his own insides.
     And suddenly...

     ...squad leaders go OVER THE WALL, the firing ERUPTS, and three
     hundred marines SCRAMBLE into the teeth of it, mortar and machine-
     gun BARRAGE lighting the sky from the row of battered palm trees,
     Ishmael SPRINTING, the man next to him goes DOWN, Ishmael TURNS
     instinctively, and a shot...

     ...RIPS into his left bicep, SPINNING him OFF his feet in SLO-MO,
     falling to dirt as all goes...

     BLACK.

     INT. SHIPBOARD OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael feverish, writhing unconscious against the straps that
     hold him to a table.  All around him, a hell of men and blood
     and doctors and limbs and shouted curses they never showed us
     on M.A.S.H.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     My arm was dealt with by a
                     pharmacist's mate, whose surgical
                     career was four hours old.

     Ishmael LURCHES, his eyes pop OPEN, wild and bleary...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He used a handsaw.

     ...seeing there, in a corner, on a pile of blood-soaked
     dressings...

     ...his left arm.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I dream of it, now and then.
                     The way my fingers curled.
                     Against the wall.

     He blinks at it.  Realizing at last that the arm is his...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...fucking goddam Jap bitch!

     An ORDERLY turns at the words.  Nods.  As if he knows.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It was all I could think of to say.

     His eyes squeeze shut.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     There was nothing more to say.
                     For a long while.

     INT. KABUO'S CELL - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on a dark blue suit.  Clean shirt.  Hanging on a hook against
     the green wall.  PAN ACROSS the bars in the cell door's tiny
     window.  All is dark out there, and silent.  Here...

     ...the bare bulb glows.  Its light throws shadows of castles and
     horses across the chessboard.

     Kabuo cross-legged on the floor, alone.  His back erect.  His eyes
     calm.  Stare at the pieces.

     EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

     Kabuo at 19 sits on the earth.  By a shovel.  By a lantern.  This
     place is shielded by trees.  PAN across the ground to...

     ...his father.  Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap
     sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth.  Wooden swords, hakama
     pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care.  Dialogue plays in
     subtitled JAPANESE...

                               ZENHICHI
                     Your great-grandfather was a
                     samurai, a magnificent soldier.

     The father never looks at the son.  Only at his work.

                               ZENHICHI
                     He killed himself.  On the
                     battlefield.  At Kumamoto.

     The boy knows this.  Yet his entire being is focused on every word.

                               ZENHICHI
                     He went to battle with a sword.
                     Against rifles, mind you.  Knowing
                     what honor required.

     An elegant SWORD.  Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light.

                               ZENHICHI
                     He was angry.  To the point of
                     being crazy, yes.  But he knew
                     what honor.  Required.

     A separate sack, just for this.  Folded with respect.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Honor can require loyalty.
                     Revenge.  Death.

     It goes into the ground.  With the others.  He seems nearly
     overcome now.  By some emotion that sweeps through him.  Prompting
     the boy to murmur...

                               KABUO
                     These are safe, father.  The
                     hakujin will never f...

                               ZENHICHI (quietly)
                     ...it is the only scale...

     Meaning, be still.  So the boy is still.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Only scale.  In which our worth.
                     Is weighed.

     The man gazes into the hole.  At his treasures.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Every life ends.  And if it ends
                     dishonored.  It is as if...

     And turns to his son.  To complete the words.

                               KABUO (in English)
                     ...we have never lived.

     There is love.  There is strength.  There is no more to say.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Sheriff Moran sits in the witness box, blade-thin and fidgeting
     ever so slightly.  Uncomfortable in the limelight.  In his hands
     are four pieces of ROPE.

                               MORAN
                     Well, this one here comes off
                     Miyamoto's boat.  Matches all his
                     others, worn equal and so on.  But
                     this one here...

     Holds it up for Hooks.  So the jury can see.

                               MORAN
                     ...comes off third cleat from the
                     stern, port side.  And it's brand
                     new.  Unlike the rest.

                               HOOKS
                     And the next one...?

                               MORAN
                     From Carl Heine's boat.  All his
                     were like this one, three-strand
                     manila, new condition, braided in
                     loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.

                               HOOKS
                     And the last...?

                               MORAN
                     Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard
                     side, second cleat from the stern.
                     But it doesn't match Carl's lines.
                     It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.

     Ah.  Hooks nods.  Significant.

                               HOOKS
                     So if defendant had tied up
                     to deceased's boat.  With that
                     last one.  Would those cleats
                     have lined up?

                               MORAN
                     You bet.  And if Miyamoto there
                     had been in a hurry to cast off,
                     he coulda left this line behind
                     on Carl's boat.

                               HOOKS
                     And replaced it later with the
                     new one.  That's your inference?

                               MORAN
                     Pretty darn clear.

     I see.  Hooks begins to pace.  Toward the jury.

                               HOOKS
                     And when you visited defendant on
                     his boat.  The evening after Carl
                     Heine's death.  Did it seem pretty
                     darn clear to him?

     EXT. THE ISLANDER - NIGHT

     Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat.  He is sliding a
     new BATTERY into place.  Beside its older companion.  He bolts it
     down.  Starts his engine.  He is visibly tense.  As he steps onto
     the deck, he sees...

     ...two figures at the pilings.  Sheriff Moran makes a cutting
     motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line.

                               MORAN
                     Cut your engine, we're coming
                     aboard.

     Kabuo doesn't move.  The tension has fled beneath the surface.  His
     face now a mask.

                               KABUO
                     What for, Sheriff?

                               MORAN
                     We have a warrant.  To search
                     your boat.

     He holds it up.  Abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything.

                               KABUO
                     Well, what are you looking f...

                               MORAN (calmly)
                     A murder weapon.  We think you
                     might be responsible for the death
                     of Carl Heine.

     Kabuo blinks.  As if hearing a foreign language.  Words that do not
     compute.

                               KABUO
                     Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl,
                     it sure as hell wasn't me.

     Moran steps from the dock ONTO the boat, Abel awkwardly following.

                               MORAN
                     Then let's get this over with, so
                     you can get to fishin'.  Now, cut
                     yor engine.

     And walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across
     everything.  Kabuo follows, killing the engine.  And in the sudden
     silence, Moran's beam finds...

     ...the still-open battery well.

                               MORAN
                     You always run with the well open?

                               KABUO
                     I was checking the cables.

     Moran's light moves over the batteries.

                               MORAN
                     D-6s, huh?

     And says no more.  Runs his beam once more around the cabin.

                               MORAN
                     We'll come back, let's take a
                     look at the stern.

     Off he goes.  Kabuo's glance goes to the open well.  Then follows,
     noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow.  But in the stern,
     Moran is shining his light.  Third cleat.  Port side.

                               MORAN
                     See you replaced a mooring line,
                     lately.  This one's new.

                               KABUO
                     Naw, I had that around for a while.

                               MORAN
                     Sure you did.  Help me with this
                     hold cover, willya?

     So Kabuo slides the cover away.  They peer in.

                               KABUO
                     There's nothin' to see.  I need to
                     get out there fi...

                               ABEL (O.S.)
                     Art.  Looka this.

     He has the fishing GAFF.  Three-and-a-half feet long.  Steel hook
     at one end.  Hands it to Moran.

                               ABEL
                     There's blood on it.

                               KABUO
                     Fish blood, I gaff fish with that.

     Moran carefully examines the object.

                               MORAN
                     You gaff with the hook end.
                     Blood's on the butt.  Where
                     your hand goes.

                               KABUO
                     Sure.  Blood gets all over your
                     hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.

     Moran takes out a handkerchief.  Holds the gaff with it.

                               MORAN
                     Gonna have this tested.  Now you
                     go home, okay?  Wait til you hear
                     from me.

     Kabuo's heart is racing.

                               KABUO
                     Sheriff, I can't afford not to
                     fish toni...

                               MORAN
                     Look, no way I'm lettin' you out
                     there.  In a half hour you could
                     be in Canada.

     Kabuo's face has gone dead.  Which makes it seem somehow fierce,
     almost threatening.  And the sheriff is watching that.

                               MORAN
                     I'm sorry, son.  But you're under
                     arrest.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Moran still on the stand.  The ropes are gone now.  His hands
     interlock across his narrow thighs.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Now your testimony was interrupted
                     yesterday, when that power line
                     set fire to your mother-in-law's
                     farmhouse...

     Art looks really irritated.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     How is your mother-in-law?

                               MORAN
                     She's alright, Nels, thanks
                     for asking.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     And her farmhouse...?

                               MORAN
                     The damage was considerable.
                     But she's insured.  Thanks, again.

     See Nels now.  Avuncular as hell.  Bemused by Moran's annoyance.

                               NELS
                     Well, just to put it back in
                     our minds, could you repeat what
                     you told us.  About the type of
                     batteries you found.  One Carl's boat.

     Moran sighs.  Tries to be patient.

                               MORAN
                     One D-6 and one D-8 in the well.
                     And a dead D-8 on the deck.

                               NELS
                     Which you inferred was replaced by
                     the D-6, which must have been a spare.

                               MORAN
                     What else could it be?

                               NELS
                     Even though a D-6 is too big, and
                     the flange had to be banged out to
                     squeeze it in.
                              (beat)
                     Which makes it a peculiar choice.
                     For a spare.

                               MORAN
                     You said that.  That was your
                     testimony.

     Everybody laughs.  Including Nels.

                               NELS (chuckling)
                     I guess I'm a pretty smart feller,
                     after all.  And what were the type
                     batteries you found on defendant's
                     boat?

                               MORAN (bland)
                     D-6s.  Like I sa...

                               NELS
                     No further questions.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     DR. STERLING WHITMAN sits in his expensive suit, a giant of a man
     whose towering frame ill fits the witness box.  His eyes are small
     and blue, and carry the weight of superiority with practiced ease.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So the blood on the gaff was not
                     fish blood at all.  It was human,
                     yes?  Type B positive.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     Carl Heine's type.

     Nels nodding.  Seemingly unconcerned by this fact.

                               NELS
                     But you can't say with any certainty
                     that the blood was his.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     No, but as I say, the type is rare.
                     Ten percent of Caucasian males.

                               NELS
                     And the blood could not have
                     belonged to defendant.  Seeing
                     that his type is O negative.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     That's obvious.

                               NELS
                     You scraped the dried blood from
                     the butt of the gaff.  Where a fella's
                     hand goes.  And what did you see under
                     your microscope, besides the B positive
                     blood and the wood scrapings...?

     And the witness stops.  A curious question.  But Nels is waiting.
     With an expectant smile.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     Bits of blood and wood.  What else
                     would there be?

                               NELS
                     No bits of bone, no particles of
                     scalp, no strands of hair?

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     None.

                               NELS
                     Well, if the blood got onto the
                     gaff by crushing a man's skull...

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was
                     asked only t...

                               NELS (gently persistent)
                     ...would that seem logical?

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     I don't know.

                               NELS
                     You don't.

     Nels lifts the gaff off the table.  Looks at it.

                               NELS
                     The coroner testified that Carl
                     Heine had a cut.  A fresh cut.
                     Probably one or two hours old.

     And grasps the butt end.  Of the gaff.

                               NELS
                     On the palm.  Of his right hand.

     Walks, dragging one leg just slightly, toward the box.  And holding
     the butt of the gaff toward him...

                               NELS
                     With no bone or scalp or hair
                     present.  Would it be more probable
                     that the blood came from crushing
                     a man's skull...

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.

                               NELS
                     ...or from the cut on his hand.
                     Which is more probable?

     Whitman won't be badgered.  His smile carries only a trace of
     coldness...

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     It is not my function.  To weigh
                     those probabilities.

     Nels looks him over.

                               NELS
                     You're right.

     And turns his back.  Walks away.

                               NELS
                     ...that's the jury's job.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks in pin-stripe serge today.  Pommaded hair, glossy wing-tips.
     He is crisp.

                               HOOKS
                     Now this regiment you were training,
                     the 442nd, this was all Nisei boys...

     First Sergeant VICTOR MAPLES wears his green dress uniform,
     splashed with decorations.  Thick and powerful, no neck, razor cut.
     The eyes are alive.

                               MAPLES
                     They were Japanese-American boys,
                     yes sir.

                               HOOKS
                     And you were generally experienced
                     in training men for hand-to-hand
                     combat.

                               MAPLES
                     It was my specialty, sir, I trained
                     several thousand over the years.

                               HOOKS
                     So.  Wide cross-section of men to
                     evaluate.  And the day that the
                     defendant volunteered for this...
                     demonstration.  Did you find him
                     eager?

                               MAPLES
                     More than eager.  He was out to
                     make a point.

     Hooks finds that interesting.  Begins to pace.

                               HOOKS
                     And what point.  Was that.

     EXT. TRAINING FIELD, CAMP SHELBY, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     The squad of Nisei recruits, one hundred young Asian faces,
     surround Sgt. Maples.  He paces before them, holding up a wooden
     staff, looking in their eyes...

                               MAPLES
                     Anyone.

     And Kabup steps forward.  Bows slightly.  Then salutes...

                               KABUO
                     SIR!

     Maples stares.  Hard.

                               MAPLES
                     You don't salute me, you don't
                     call me 'sir', soldier, I'm an
                     enlisted man.

     Kabuo stares back.  Blank.

                               MAPLES
                     And nobody bows in this man's
                     Army, you're in America, son.
                     Not Japan.

                               KABUO
                     I'm sorry, sir, force of habit.

                               MAPLES
                     No more 'sir'.  That's the last
                     of that.

     Tosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet.  A little hard.  As Kabuo
     slips the helmet on...

                               MAPLES
                     The exercise is avoiding thrusts.
                     Now, first y...

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Ready, sergeant.

     Cut off in mid-word, Maples glares back.  Are you?  THRUSTS
     sharply, but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more
     than an inch.  Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, Maples unleashes...

     ...a SAVAGE series of THRUSTS at blinding SPEED, and Kabuo...

     ...SLIPS them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move.  As a man
     might toy with a child.  Maples studies the face for any trace of
     mockery.  And sees nothing at all.  STABS out, only to have Kabuo...

     ...SLASH Maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to
     be nearly invisible.  Maples clearly STUNNED by the display.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Excuse me.

     He bends, picks up Maples' staff, hands it to him.  And bows.
     Slightly.  The sergeant is hot.  He looks into the faces of this
     Nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk.  There is none.

                               MAPLES
                     Are you ready for some simulated
                     combat, soldier?

                               KABUO
                     For combat.  Sergeant.

     And Maples LUNGES with surprising speed, to be SWEPT off his feet
     in a BLUR, lying FLAT on the earth, his head PINNED to the ground
     by the tip of Kabuo's staff.

     A hush.  Kabuo withdraws his staff.  Retrieves Maples'...

                               KABUO (just above a whisper)
                     Your weapon, sergeant.

     And bows.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Maples smiling easily.  Like a guy telling the story in a bar.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, what then, sergeant?

                               MAPLES
                     What else?  I had the boy teach
                     me kendo.  Including...the importance
                     of the bow.

     Everyone laughs.  Maples the loudest.  Hooks smiles like a regular
     Joe.

                               HOOKS
                     And your evaluation of the
                     defendant?  Could he kill a much
                     larger man with a fishing gaff?
                     So quickly, there would be no
                     sign of struggle?

                               MAPLES
                     Oh, in a heartbeat.

     And the smiles are gone.  All around.

                               MAPLES
                     Able and willing.  Like few men
                     I've ever seen.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks sits against the prosecution table.  His demeanor gentle,
     respectful.  His voice soft.

                               HOOKS
                     So the plan was for your husband
                     to fish through the prime season.
                     Then, in November, sell the boat.
                     And you would move onto the farm.

     In the box, the widow sits in lovely dignity.  Blonde and alabaster
     and modest, in her black dress of mourning.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     That was his plan, yes.

     In the press row, the boys are attentive.  An angle they know they
     can sell.  Ishmael among them, watching with neutral eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Whatever she said, she was Hooks'
                     star witness.  The jury, especially
                     the men, would not betray this fine
                     lady with a not guilty verdict.  How
                     could they face her?

     Hooks walks slowly toward her.  As if she were a precious object,
     deserving of reverence.

                               HOOKS
                     Can you think back for me to the
                     morning of September 8?  The day
                     after your husband purchased the
                     farm.  One week before his death.
                     Can you recall that morning?

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I can.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     A bright bathroom, filled with STEAM, filtering the sunlight.  PUSH
     toward the opaque shower door, TOWARD the sound of rushing water.
     And of breathing.  THROUGH it to...

     ...Susan Marie and her husband.  Her arms are wound about his neck.
     Her legs wrapped around his body, feet locked behind the small of
     his back.  Carl holds her high with his strong hands, so he can
     lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow, slow thrusts.  Her wet
     blonde hair is pasted across her face, and her eyes are closed.
     The intensity holds us.

     INT. PARLOR - MORNING

     CLOSE on a paint brush.  It rests across the lid of a can of wood
     stain.  See now...

     ...Susan Marie kneeling by the table she is refinishing.  But her
     hands, her body, are motionless.  Her eyes stare out the window...

     ...across the yard.  Her towering husband walks beside a smaller
     man.  Carl is doing the talking.  Kabuo's face is stone.

     INT. PARLOR - LATER

     Susan Marie sits quietly in a rocker, nursing her baby.  Her hands
     tenderly stroke the feeding infant.  But her eyes are attentive.
     Concerned.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     What could I tell him?  There's
                     my mother to think about.  You
                     know what she'd say?

     Susan Marie knows.  What Etta would say.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     I said I'd think it over, talk
                     with you.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Did he go away angry?

     See Carl now, pacing his own parlor like a caged bear.  Agitated in
     a way we could not have expected.

                               CARL
                     He kept talkin' about those seven
                     acres belonged to his father, and
                     how honorable and decent his father
                     was.  His meaning was pretty clear.
                     And I didn't much like it.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     You had a scrap.

     Nursing her baby.  Calm, direct.

                               CARL
                     I couldn't...talk to him.  Look,
                     Kabuo's a Jap.  And I don't hate
                     Japs, but I don't like 'em neither.
                     It's hard to explain if you weren't
                     in the war, you know?

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     He's not a Jap.  You don't mean
                     that.  You and he were friends.

     And Carl turns.  Looks at her.  A full beat.

                               CARL
                     We were kids.

     He looks helpless.  Frustrated.  He doesn't want his anger to spill
     onto her.

     He leaves the room.  Without a word.  HOLD on her.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Susan Marie's cornflower eyes are set.  Wary.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So your husband said he's think
                     it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto
                     to believe he might sell to h...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I wouldn't say encouraged.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Well, he didn't say 'no', did he?
                     Didn't say no hope existed.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Not in those words.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So the defendant was encouraged
                     to hope.  Or could have been.

     She thinks about this.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I guess so.

     Nels is nodding.  Nodding.

                               NELS
                     I guess you'd have to guess.
                     Not having been there with them.
                     Having to guess whether your husband's
                     report was word for word accurate.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Carl never lied.

                               NELS
                     Of course not.  But it was
                     emotional.  A friend's plea set
                     against his mother's attitude.

     And then.  As if it had just occurred to him...

     CLICK.  All the lights in the courtroom go OUT.  A loud murmur.  A
     FLICKER of light.  Then, they go OUT again.

     The crowd BUZZES, laughs, the gavel RAPS.  The lights come ON.  A
     collective sound of relief.  The gavel AGAIN.  Finally, silence.

                               NELS

     She arches her throat.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     And we can't ask him anymore.

     INT. ISHMAEL'S DESOTO, CENTER VALLEY - TWILIGHT

     Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry
     fields of Center Valley.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     My father had bought the DeSoto
                     fifteen years before.  Driving it
                     reminded me of him.  Which I
                     considered a neutral fact...

     He turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for
     his convenience.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Actually, it was pleasant.

     Following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Snow made all the fields into one.
                     The notion that one man might kill
                     another for a small patch, made no
                     sense.

     Up ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch.  A middle
     aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     But I knew such things occurred.
                     Having been to war and all.

     The man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter
     working with a shovel behind the car.  Ishmael pulls up behind
     them.  And gets out.

     He crunches over to where Hisao works...

                               ISHMAEL
                     May I give you folks a lift?

     Hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair
     from her eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I didn't look at her.  I thought
                     that would be best.

     Her eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side.
     Murmurs to him in Japanese.  WHen he answers, she turns to face
     Ishmael...

                               HATSUE
                     My father is grateful for your
                     kindness.  But he will free his
                     car, shortly.

     Ishmael smiles softly.  This car isn't going anywhere.  He goes to
     Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Okay, I'll help.

     INT. DESOTO, SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT

     Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I know it's caused you trouble.
                     But don't you think the snow is
                     beautiful, coming down?

     His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror.  She stares out
     the side window, concentrating on the world.  Two strands of wet
     hair pasted against her cheek.

                               HISAO
                     Yes, very beautiful.

     Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart
     away.  Hers hold.

                               HATSUE
                     This trial is unfair.  You should
                     write about that in your newspaper.

     He keeps driving.  And he keeps his eyes on the road.

                               ISHMAEL (calmly)
                     What should I say?

                               HATSUE
                     Just that.  This trial is wrong,
                     they are calling a good man a killer.
                     It is only about prejudice, and that
                     is unfair.

     He thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him.

                               ISHMAEL
                     We all expect the world to be fair.
                     As if we have some right t...

                               HATSUE
                     I don't mean everyone.  Just people
                     who can do things because they can
                     arrest people or convict them.  Or
                     run a newspaper.

     And his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe I should write a column.
                     What do you think?

     She studies his face.

                               HATSUE
                     What do you think?

     No smile.  On either side.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I think people.  Should be fair.

     His eyes on the road now.  The farmhouse seen through the drifting
     screen of white.

                               HATSUE
                     Will you write that?

     Her voice is soft.  The difference is palpable.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I might just.

     His voice is kindness and friendship.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I was part of her life again.  I
                     was a person.

     EXT. COAST GUARD LIGHTHOUSE, POINT WHITE - DUSK

     A tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the
     sea.  Ishmael's hand in his pocket.  Trudging toward it.

     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - DUSK

     Ishmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling
     with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags.  Our host is
     LEVANT, a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a
     huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair.  He gestures around the
     room at all the records.  Voila.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You have the night watch?  On the
                     radio.

                               LEVANT
                     Since September.  Last guys got
                     transferred.

     Ishmael looks around.  There is a lot of stuff.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And you keep the records, or
                     contribute to 'em.

                               LEVANT
                     Shorthard the radio transmis-
                     sions, write 'em up, file 'em
                     in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks.
                     Just take up space.

     Ishmael nods.  Guess so.

                               ISHMAEL
                     All kinds of radio transmissions?
                     Fisherman in trouble, and such.

     Innocent question.  Random example.

                               LEVANT
                     All kinds.  Make yourself at home.

     And leaves.  Ishmael looks at the task before him.  Then, out
     the window.  Dark now.  His reflection stares back.  As troubled
     as he is.

     INT. PETERSEN'S GROCERIES - DAY

     Ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a
     grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the
     elbow.  He turns the corner to see...

     ...three people in line at the register.  The second is Hatsue.  An
     infant carried at her shoulder.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I'd been back two months.  It was
                     the first time I'd seen her.

     He joins the line.  The CHECKER glances his way, then looks
     awkwardly down.  This makes the others turn.  And Hatsue's eyes.
     Meet his.

                               HATSUE
                     Hello.

     The voice, the face, are cool and formal.  There is no anger, no
     unkindness.  Only the absence of warmth.  Ishmael nods.  His face
     hard, stricken.  His heart pounds in his throat.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I couldn't say anything.  I just
                     stood there, hating her.

                               HATSUE
                     I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and
                     I.  Are very sor...

                               ISHMAEL
                     The Japs did it.

     No one knows where to look.  Down, away, anything.  But Hatsue
     never blinks.

                               ISHMAEL
                     They shot it off.  At Tarawa.

     She holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow.  Somewhere between
     compassion and pity.  Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her
     shoulder.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that.

     All the feeling comes to his eyes.  Everything he will never tell
     her.  A murmur...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry about everything.  All
                     of it.

     He drops his milk and crackers on the counter.

     And walks away.

     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael sits alone.  Beyond the glass, a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the
     sea, the snow-covered shore.  But Ishmael stares at a folder.  Open
     in his lap.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     September 16.  At 1:42 A.M., the
                     dead of night.  The S.S. West Corona,
                     a Greek-owned freighter, was lost.
                     In heavy fog.

     His finger.  Traces a line of the report.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     They radioed to the lighthouse.
                     They would have to dogleg, bisecting
                     Ship Channel Bank.  And Seaman Philip
                     Milholland wrote that down.  In his
                     report.

     Ishmael closes his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Carl Heine drowned.  In Ship
                     Channel Bank.  And his watch
                     stopped.  At 1:47.

     He looks out through the glass.  As if he could watch it happen.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     A huge freighter plowing through.
                     Throwing a wake big enough to fling
                     any man overboard.

     And Ishmael removes the page from the file.  Slowly, he folds it
     into quarters.  Slides it into his coat pocket.

                               ISHMAEL (calls out)
                     Seaman...?

     And closes the file.  Slips it back into the cabinet.  Levant
     appears, vaguely irritated by the summons.  So Ishmael smiles.
     Sorry, nothing important.

                               ISHMAEL
                     How long you have this detail?

                               LEVANT
                     Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch
                     September 16.

     Ishmael's face.  Just to clarify...

                               ISHMAEL
                     You mean, early morning the 16th?

                               LEVANT
                     No, night of the 16th, morning the
                     17th.  We replaced two guys named
                     Miller and Milholland.

     Oh.  Ishmael nods.

                               LEVANT
                     They got transferred that day.
                     Out to Cape Flattery.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Some seaman's loast report.
                     Stuffed in a cabinet, good as
                     lost forever.  No one knows.

     Ishmael rises, stiffly.  Starts to pull on his coat.

                               LEVANT
                     You get what you come for?

     And Ishmael looks at the youngster.  A little oddly.  Admits...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Guess I'm not completely sure.
                     What that was.

     EXT. FLETCHER'S BAY - MORNING

     Ishmael at 24, crouched among trees.  Above a sunlit stretch of
     beach.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I left the grocery, and wrote a
                     letter.  I apologizes from my heart.
                     I should never have said that word
                     to her.  I never would again.

     CLOSE on his face.  Eyes gazing down.  At something.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It sat in my desk for two weeks.
                     Before I threw it away.

     He sighs.  Rises slowly.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I knew her car.  And sometimes
                     when I'd see it, I'd...drive that
                     way.  At a distance.

     See Hatsue down on the beach.  Alone, raking for steamer clams.
     Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella.

     Ishmael walks down to the sand.  Crosses to where she works.  And
     squats down.  At a respectful distance.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Can I talk to you?

     She must have seen who was coming.  Because the words do not
     startle her.  Or slow her work.

                               HATSUE
                     I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't
                     right for us to be alone.  People
                     will t...

                               ISHMAEL
                     There's no one here, and I've got
                     to talk to you.

     Her back is to him.  She is motionless.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Don't you owe me that?

     And she turns.  Her eyes go first to her sleeping child.  Then she
     walks over, and sinks to the sand.  Just before him.  Near enough
     to touch.

     She looks in his eyes.  And waits.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm like a dying person.

     The words just came out.  His eyes move over her face.  His aching
     for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I don't sleep.  I tell myself this
                     can't go on, but it goes on anyway.

     He seems at the edge of insanity.  Or tears.

                               HATSUE
                     I did a terrible thing, Ishmael.
                     I knew what you felt.  And what I
                     didn't.

     Sadness in her voice.  But strength as well.

                               HATSUE
                     And I never found the courage to
                     tell you.

     His eyes swim with tears.  He chokes them back, he has to.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You'll think this is crazy, but all
                     I want is to hold you.  Just once.
                     And smell your hair.

     She absorbs this.  No sign of repulsion or anger.  Her eyes seem
     wise.  And very sad.

                               HATSUE
                     You have to hear this, I can
                     never touch you, Ishmael.  Not
                     once, not ever.  There's no half-
                     way.  As much as I know it hurts
                     you, you have to let this go.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Look, I want to forget you, I do.
                     I think if you hold me, just this
                     once, I can walk away and never
                     speak to you again.

     She just keeps looking at him.  There is a bravery to her steady
     gaze.  Her calm resolve.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Please?  As one human being to
                     another, just because I'm miserable
                     and don't know where to turn.  I
                     need to be in your arms.  If it's
                     just for thirty seconds.

     His pleading look holds her for a moment.  In the silence...

                               HATSUE
                     I hurt for you.  Whether you'll
                     ever believe that or not.

     Feeling behind her eyes.  First time she lets it show.

                               HATSUE
                     I feel sick sometimes, with the
                     guilt of what I've done to you.
                     And I can't make it right.

     She rises slowly.  Brushes the sand from her skirt.

                               HATSUE
                     To hold you would be wrong and
                     deceitful.  You're going to have
                     to live without holding me, that
                     is the truth of the way things are.

     She takes one step back.

                               HATSUE
                     Things end.  They do.  Get on
                     with your life.

     And turns away.  She gathers her baby in her arms.  Takes her
     blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail.  He watches, never
     moving, as she gathers her things.  Gathers them as if he wasn't
     there.  And with her back turned...

                               HATSUE
                     Get on with your life.

     She walks slowly away.  Her baby cries.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a steaming soup kettle, resting on a woodstove.  A woman's
     hand stirs with a wooden ladle.  PULL BACK to see...

     HELEN CHAMBERS, slender and strong and keen.  She is not yet 60.  A
     code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned
     features.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I drove from the lighthouse to
                     my mother's place.  I brought
                     her some groceries.

     Beyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever.  Silent.
     Spellbinding.

                               HELEN
                     Your father thought that heavy snow
                     was God's kindness.  Despite the
                     hardship, it brought us beauty...

     Ishmael at the rustic table.  Watching her back.

                               HELEN
                     ...and reminded us.  Of our place
                     in things.

     Softer.  Not bitter, but regretful that...

                               HELEN
                     You don't believe in God anymore.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve,
                     Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.

     She begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls.

                               HELEN
                     We don't know God, we feel Him.  You
                     felt Him as a child.  I remember.

     And turns.  Looks at him.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's a long time ago.  What a
                     child feels...that's different.

     She studies him silently for a moment.  Then brings the bowls to
     the table...

                               HELEN
                     Spend the night, will you?  Don't
                     go back out into all that snow.

     Sets them down.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I felt Milholland's report in my
                     pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't
                     telling her.  Telling someone.
                     What I'd found.

                               HELEN
                     You've been busy with that trial,
                     I suppose.  Such a travesty...

     She takes her seat.  As he watches her.

                               HELEN
                     They only arrested that poor soul
                     because he's Japanese.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They
                     say the evidence is rock solid.

     She begins to eat.  Eyes on her bowl.

                               HELEN
                     They're not his neighbor, like
                     you are.  He is a husband, a father,
                     he risked his life for their country.
                     The same as you.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Those aren't the facts that matter.

     She looks up.  Straight to his eyes.

                               HELEN
                     Well, folks are pretty cold.
                     And folks who believe in nothing
                     else...they're cold, too.

     No mistaking her meaning.  He swallows.  Uneasy as always, in the
     path of her disapproval.

                               HELEN
                     I've tried to understand your
                     unhappiness, all these years.
                     Having gone to war, losing your arm...

     The directness of her gaze.  He can't turn from that.

                               HELEN
                     But other boys came back.  And
                     pushed on.  They found girls, and
                     married, had babies...

     He doesn't flinch.  His voice too quiet with...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Someday I'll get lucky, too.

     Too quiet to conceal the hurt.  She thinks it is hurt she has
     caused.  It changes her tone to a plea...

                               HELEN
                     Your father fought at Belleau
                     Wood, it took him years to get
                     over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...

                               ISHMAEL
                     ...but he found you.

     Their eyes locked.

                               HELEN
                     It isn't the war, Ishmael.  All
                     those years growing up.  You never
                     had a real girl of your own.

     And now he looks down.  He sees that his fist is tight around the
     handle of his spoon.

                               HELEN
                     And I know you have it in you
                     to love.  I know that much.  I
                     wish I knew more.

     His fingers open, and the spoon clatters softly on the wood.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'll stay tonight.  Thanks
                     for asking.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael wanders through a silent room.  A bed, a dresser.  Work
     table and lamp.  A room denuded of all decoration, all possessions,
     all sign of life.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I came back from the war to
                     this room.  I stayed a few
                     months.  Until my father passed.

     EXT. VETERAN'S CEMETERY - DAY

     Ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned
     at the elbow.  The diggers are filling a grave in distance.
     Mourners mingle, some casting glances back at Ishmael.  Keeping
     their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect.

     One man comes to him.  MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail.  But his
     voice is clear...

                               NAGAISHI
                     The Japanese people of the island
                     are saddened by this loss.  Your
                     father was a man of great fairness
                     and compassion for others...

     He stands at a respectful distance.  Ishmael clears his throat.  He
     nods, thank you.  No words to say.  So the small man adds...

                               NAGAISHI
                     A friend to us.  And to all people.

     Silence.  They are a tableau of stone.  Finally...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well...

     And no more.  The man takes a step back...

                               NAGAISHI
                     We know you will follow in his
                     footsteps.  And honor his legacy.

     Which changes Ishmael's face.  To something harder.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I thought it then.  And often since.
                     A balance, he's said.  Finding the
                     facts.  That folks needed to know.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael stands at an open closet.  Cardboard boxes have been set
     aside.  One has been searched for treasure.  The page is in his
     hand.  Only slightly discolored by age.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     Dear Ishmael.  These things are
                     very difficult to say.  I can't
                     think of anything more painful
                     than writing this letter.

     He closes his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     Think of reading it.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     I don't love you, Ishmael.  There
                     is no more honest way to say it.

     He carries the letter to the twin bed.  Where he slept alone.
     Thinking of her.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     Whenever we were together, I knew
                     it.  I loved you and I didn't love
                     you at the same moment.

     He sinks slowly.  As if beneath the letter's weight.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     The last time.  At the cedar tree.
                     I knew we could never be right
                     together.  And that soon I would
                     have to tell you.

     His eyes are dry.  The letter has used up his tears long ago.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     This is the last time I will write
                     to you.  I am not yours anymore.

     He sets the letter on the bed beside him.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     I wish you the very best.  Your
                     heart is large and you are gentle
                     and kind.  I know you will do great
                     things in the world.

     He reaches now to his inside coat pocket.  Withdrawing...

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     I must say good-bye to you now.
                     Our lives will move on.  The best
                     we can.

     ...a page.  Folded in quarters.  Sets it near the letter.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Milholland's report was like her
                     letter.  Something no one else.
                     Would ever read.

     He stares at them.  Side by side.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Thing about having only one hand.
                     It's hard to tear pages up.  And
                     I wasn't carrying a match.

     He lies back.  Across the bed.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     So I thought of my father.  The man
                     who would have taken this report to
                     Judge Fielding.

     Tears stand in his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     But every reporter.  Chooses his own
                     balance.  FInds the facts that matter.

     Shuts the eyes.  Against them.  Against everything.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     After all, the freighter was only
                     a theory.  It proved nothing at
                     all.  There were other facts.
                     That mattered.

     We CLOSE on his face.  The tightness of the muscles.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Tomorrow I would write a column.
                     About prejudice.  And she would
                     be grateful.  For my large...and
                     gentle...heart.

     The eyes open, they are blank.  Staring...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Her husband would be judged.  And
                     she would be alone.

     ...at the future.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Alone.  The past looks different.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hatsue Miyamoto in the witness box. Graceful, erect, her porcelain
     beauty accessible, eager to cooperate.  Humble.

                               HATSUE
                     Hopeful.  Is the word I would use.

     And Nels seems slightly surprised.

                               NELS
                     But Carl didn't say yes.

                               HATSUE
                     He didn't say no.  That was Kabuo's
                     point.  Given how Carl's mother
                     felt, Carl was still willing to
                     consider selling to us.  It was a
                     good sign.

     Nels considers that.

                               NELS
                     Well, in the week that followed,
                     the week before Carl's death...
                     did your husband pursue him?

                               HATSUE
                     No.  Kabuo did not wish to beg,
                     he respected Carl's right to
                     reflect.  He was sure Carl would
                     do the honorable thing.

                               NELS (right back)
                     And did he?

     She nods.  Only once.  Her eyes bright.

                               HATSUE
                     The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped
                     Carl at sea.  With his dead battery.

     Nels raises his eyebrows.  To give the point its weight.

                               HATSUE
                     Right there, on the boat, they
                     agreed.  $8400 for the seven acres,
                     $800 down.  They shook on it.  Kabuo
                     was so excited when he came home.

     Nels lets that sit.  And sit.

                               NELS
                     And when did you first learn.
                     That Carl had drowned?

     The slightest pause.  As if hesitant to confess...

                               HATSUE
                     One o'clock, that afternoon, from
                     a clerk at Petersen's.

                               NELS (turning to Hooks)
                     Your witness.

     And Alvin Hooks rises.  Perches on the edge of the prosecutor's
     table.  And looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion.

                               HOOKS
                     Your husband came home agitated,
                     after his encounter with the
                     deceased?

     No impatience across her perfect features.  Only earnestness
     will do.

                               HATSUE
                     I said 'excited'.  Not agitated,
                     he was excited in the sense of
                     being overjoyed.

                               HOOKS
                     You were...overjoyed yourself, to
                     hear the news?

                               HATSUE
                     Happy for him.  And relieved.

                               HOOKS
                     So, then, you...and your husband...
                     must have called friends, relatives,
                     to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?

                               HATSUE (calm, respectful)
                     No.

                               HOOKS
                     Really?  Didn't call your mother,
                     your sisters, about starting a new
                     life.  Your husband never tells
                     his brothers that the family honor
                     is vindicated.

     Hatsue shifts in her chair.  Smooths her skirt.

                               HATSUE
                     We hear how Carl...passed away.
                     Only a few hours later.

                               HOOKS
                     Your husband returned at, what,
                     seven o'clock?

                               HATSUE
                     Closer to eight.

                               HOOKS
                     So, five hours.  Plenty of time for
                     a call.  He was 'excited', you say.
                     In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.

     She nods, he was.

                               HATSUE
                     We are...cautious people.  You
                     would say conservative.  There
                     would be time for celebrating
                     with others when a paper was signed.

     Hooks pouts.  He allows himself that.

                               HOOKS
                     You thought the deceased might...
                     break his promise?

                               HATSUE
                     Of course not.  We're just not
                     quick to run and boast.  In case
                     something went wrong.

                               HOOKS
                     And then, something did.  Carl
                     Heine was found dead.  With his
                     head crushed.

     She weathers that last part.  As if taking no notice.

                               HATSUE
                     Yes, and then, what was there
                     to call about?  Everything was
                     up in the air.

                               HOOKS
                     Up in the air?  Was that your
                     reaction?

     And he rises.  Tastefully indignant.

                               HOOKS
                     I would suggest that more happened
                     than a land sale evaporating.  A
                     man died, Mrs. Miyamoto.  A husband
                     and father of small children had
                     his skull bashed in!

                               HATSUE (quiet dignity)
                     If you mean to imply that we were
                     callous about Carl's death, that is
                     wrong and insulting.

                                HOOKS
                     I see.  Well, did you come
                     forward to tell Sheriff Moran
                     what you knew?  The encounter in
                     the fog, the...dead battery, was it?

     Silence.

                               HATSUE
                     We discussed that.  And decided
                     not to.

                               HOOKS
                     Why not?

     She looks at him with the directness we've seen before.

                               HATSUE
                     Because the facts could be
                     misconstrued as murder.

                               HOOKS
                     But if truth was on your side,
                     whatever were you worried about?

     Her eyes cut to Nels.  He smiles, to blunt the harm she's done by
     looking to him for support.  Her gaze goes down now.  And then...

     ...back up.  Straight to Hooks.

                               HATSUE
                     Trials aren't only about truth,
                     Mr. Hooks.  Even though they
                     should be.  They're about what
                     people believe is true.

                               HOOKS
                     So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.

                               HATSUE
                     We were afraid.  Silence seemed
                     better.  To come forward seemed
                     like a mistake.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, it seems to me...

                               NELS (gently)
                     Objection.  Mr. Hooks can give
                     his view in his summation.

                               HOOKS
                     Doesn't it seem to you, Mrs.
                     Miyamoto, that your mistake was
                     in being deceitful?  Concealing
                     information during the course of
                     a sheriff's investigation.

                               HATSUE
                     It seems human.  To me.

     Oh.  Hooks raises his brows.

                               HOOKS
                     I suppose that you mean this excuses
                     concealing the truth.  Then why
                     ahouls any of us believe you now?

     And in the silence...

                               HOOKS
                     Question withdrawn, you may
                     step down.

                               HATSUE
                     You're implying th...

                               HOOKS
                     I said.  No further questions.

     Anger flashes across her eyes.  Her face colors.  She draws a
     breath...

                               JUDGE
                     That's enough, Mrs. Miyamoto, not
                     another word.  Step down, please.

     She looks to Nels in her desperation and regret for making things
     worse.  he chuckles and waves.  It's quite all right.  She sits for
     a frozen moment.  And as she rises...

     The boys in the reporter's row are scribbling furiously.

     All but one.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     JOSIAH GILLANDERS folds his blunt, thick hands across his belly.
     Nearly 50, sporting a walrus moustache and the watery, dull eyes of
     an alcoholic, he is a man ready to make the most of his fifteen
     minutes of fame.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Thirty years fishing alone.  Ever
                     had an occasion to board another
                     man's boat except in an emergency?
                     Maybe to socialize or some such?

                               GILLANDERS (ready for this)
                     Never.  Only boarded some fella's boat
                     five, six times in thirty-one years.
                     Dead engine, broken hip, only in need.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Now, Mister Gi...

                               GILLANDERS
                     Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't
                     bother each other, stick to ourselves.
                     Ask anybody.

     Nels is wandering over to the jury box.

                               NELS
                     Now if you wanted to kill a man.
                     Think you'd try boarding against
                     his will, and hitting him with a
                     fishing gaff?

                               GILLANDERS
                     It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's
                     boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come
                     aboard?  All against Carl's will?
                     It's the stupidest suggestion I
                     ever heard of.

                               NELS
                     I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't
                     mine in the first place.

     Gentle laughter.  Even some on the jury.

                               NELS
                     So the fishing gaff method wouldn't
                     make sense?

                               GILLANDERS
                     Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd
                     just shoot the feller.  Then tie
                     up, throw him inta th' drink.  And
                     skip bein' the first gill-netter
                     in history to make a successful
                     forced boarding.

     More laughter.  Hooks at his table.  Simply smiles.

                               NELS
                     Now the sheriff believed that the
                     D-6 battery in Carl's well was
                     Carl's own spare.  Even though it
                     was too large f...

                               GILLANDERS
                     No sense to have any at all.,
                     even the right size.  It's like
                     having an extra battery in the
                     trunk of your car.  Nobody does.

     Nobody.  No way.

                               GILLANDERS
                     Boat has two batteries.  Lose one
                     you run off the other til morning.
                     Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto
                     there gave him one a his.

                               NELS
                     Course, if Carl lost both batteries,
                     dead in the water, his radio wouldn't
                     work.  So how would he signal for help?

                               GILLANDERS
                     Compressed air horn, most likely.
                     Hope to God some man hears you in
                     that fog.

                               NELS
                     All right, what if the defendant
                     heard?  So Carl let him aboard, to
                     help.  And then the fishing gaff?

     Gillanders grins.  Wide.

                               GILLANDERS
                     You mean Miyamoto followed him out
                     there, and sucker-punched him?

                               NELS
                     Well, what if?

                               GILLANDERS
                     Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know
                     in advance?  That Carl loses two
                     batteries.  Must happen once ever'
                     20 years or so.

     Another chuckle or two from the gallery.

                               NELS
                     Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank
                     you for coming down, in this cold
                     weather.

                               GILLANDERS
                     Well, it does seem mighty warm in
                     here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.

     And looks at the prosecutor.  Who rises, easily.  A most polite
     fuck-you smile.  Hooks strolls now.  Slow and steady.  Straight to
     the witness box.  Rests his hands on the rail.  Leans in.

                               HOOKS
                     What if the defendant follows Carl.
                     And pretends his own batteries are
                     dead?  Would Carl tie up and help?

     And the smile on Gillander's face.  Stops.  Cold.

                               HOOKS
                     Is the word you're groping
                     for...'yes', perha...

                               JUDGE (O.S.)
                     Alvin!

                               HOOKS
                     Rephrase.  Do you agree that he
                     might tie up to the defendant's bo...

                               GILLANDERS
                     So why's the D-6 in Carl's well?

                               HOOKS
                     Who's to say?  Maybe it was just
                     a spare, after all.  Or maybe the
                     defendant left it, as a potential
                     alibi.  In case somebody saw him
                     in Ship Channel Bank.
                              (beat)
                     In case we put two and two
                     together, knowing of the hostility.
                     Between the families.

     Gillanders.  Actually thinking about that.

                               HOOKS
                     My question is.  Could Carl have
                     tied up to help the defendant?

     A beat.  A cleared throat.

                               GILLANDERS
                     It coulda happened.  And if I start
                     to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y
                     say 'no further questions', right?

     Once more, laughter.  Enough to bring the gavel DOWN.

                               HOOKS
                     Right about that.  And right that
                     it 'coulda happened'.

     Turns his back, walks away.

                               HOOKS
                     Thanks for your help.  Hope the
                     witness box wasn't too warm for
                     your comfort.

     All eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits.  Except for the
     defendant.  His stare forward.  Recalling...

     INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT

     Kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell, leaning back
     against the wall.  Leaving the cot.  For his guest.

                               NELS
                     But the toughest scenario.  Is the
                     one Hooks will never raise.

     Kabuo watching.  Quiet.  Takes a breath...

                               KABUO
                     And what's that?

                               NELS
                     That you came upon Carl by accident.
                     Like you said.  Gave him the battery.
                     Like you said.  Asked him about the
                     seven acres.  Like you said.

     The hardest.  Straightest.  Look.

                               NELS
                     Only.  He said no.

     Silence.

                               NELS
                     And something...happened.  That
                     you'd never planned.  Because
                     you're not a cold-blooded killer.

     Nobody flinches.  Nobody blinks.

                               KABUO
                     I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh?
                     Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.

                               NELS
                     You won't hear that from Hooks.
                     Because the charge is first-degree
                     murder, which requires premeditation.
                     He can't change the charge.

     Do you understand?

                               NELS
                     So if the jury thinks you did kill.
                     but only in the heat of anger.  They
                     have to acquit.

     Do you?

                               NELS
                     And you couldn't.  Be.  Re-tried.

     Kabuo's face is stone.  A warrior's mask.

                               KABUO
                     You want me to say that.

                               NELS
                     I want you.  To tell the truth.

     There is no kindly smile tonight.  No candy bars.

                               KABUO
                     You think that is the truth.

                               NELS
                     I told your wife.  Trials aren't
                     always so much about actual truth.
                     As about what folks believe is true.
                     That's sad.  And it's real.

                               KABUO
                     And what do you believe?

     Nels sighs.  Cocks his head just to one side.

                               NELS
                     A question first.  Why do you want
                     to know?

                               KABUO (straight back)
                     Because you're my friend.

     The old man thinks about that.  Studies his client.

                               NELS
                     I believe you are a good man.  Who
                     belongs with his family.

     And then the feeling comes.  To the watery eyes.

                               NELS
                     And I believe.  You didn't do it.

     EXT. SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT

     Fog.  The sound of water.  Lapping at the hull of a boat.  The mist
     drfits, revealing...

     Eyes.  They are blue.  The heavy brows above them dark gold, matted
     and damp.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     My batteries are drawed down, both
                     of 'em.  ALternator belts were loose.

     PULL BACK to see him.  With his keroses lantern and his air horn.

                               KABUO (O.S.)
                     No sweat.  We'll pull one a mine,
                     get ya started.

     PULL BACK to see him now, leaning on his gaff.  Squinting up.  At
     the top of Carl's mast.  We follow his gaze to see...

                               KABUO (O.S.)
                     You lashed up a lantern?  'Gainst
                     a fog like this?

     See it now.  SWAYING as the helpless boat bobs in the night.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     Lantern and a air horn.  That's
                     all I got, without my juice.

     INT. CARL'S CABIN - LATER

     CLOSE on a battery well.  One battery sits in place, one spot is
     empty.  And...

     ...CRASH!  The butt end of a fishing gaff BANGS against the metal
     flange.  Again.  Again.  AGAIN.  And as the next blow is STRUCK,
     the huge hand...

     ...slips, and the soft metal SLICES Carl's flesh across his palm.
     He stops.  Then SMASHES away, twice more.  We PULL BACK to see...

     ...two batteries lie above the well.  Carl sucks the blood from his
     cut.  Then lifts Kabuo's D-6 into place...

                               CARL
                     Don't know how long it's take to
                     get a charge...

                               KABUO
                     Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish.
                     I'll see ya back on the docks...

     Kabuo takes his gaff.  Heedless of Carl's blood on the butt end.
     Carl looks up, still crouching above his well.

                               CARL (quietly)
                     Hold on.  You know as well as
                     I do, we got somethin' to talk
                     about.

     No response from Kabuo.  He stands above the larger man.  Silent,
     neutral.  Waiting.

                               CARL
                     Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what
                     you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious,
                     is all.

                               KABUO
                     What are you sellin' 'em for?
                     Why don't we start there.

     Which makes the big man smile.  Just a little.

                               CARL
                     Did I say I was selling?  But
                     if I was, I'd have to figure you
                     want 'em real bad.  Oughta charge
                     a sall fortune, maybe...

     A slight shrug.  Of giant shoulders.

                               CARL
                     Then again.  Maybe you'd want
                     your battery back.

     Kabuo doesn't grin back.  His face shows nothing at all.

                               KABUO
                     The battery's in, that's done
                     with.  Besides, you'd do the
                     same for m...

                               CARL
                     ...might do the same.  I have to
                     warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm
                     not screwed together like I used
                     to be.

     Kabuo's face remains impassive.  Patient.  And the big man squints
     up into it.  Holding a handkerchief to his injured hand.

                               CARL
                     Hell, I'm sorry, okay?  About
                     the whole damn mess.  If I'd a
                     been around, my mother wouldn't
                     a pulled it off that way.

     He is sorry.  And with that, Kabuo's face eases.  Becomes like
     Carl's own.

                               CARL (grins)
                     I was out there at sea.  Fightin'
                     you Jap sons-a-bitches.

                               KABUO (no grin)
                     I'm an American.  Did I call you
                     a Nazi, you big Nazi bastard?

                               CARL (softly)
                     Not that I recall.

                               KABUO
                     I killed men who looked just like
                     you, pig-fed German bastards.  And
                     their blood don't wash off so easy.

     Still no smile.  Carl staring up.

                               KABUO
                     So don't talk to me about Japs,
                     you big Nazi son of a bitch.

     Carl laughs.  And Kabuo chuckles, right along with him.  Having
     kept his poker face the longer.

                               CARL
                     I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun
                     Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still
                     got your bamboo fishing rod.

                               KABUO
                     Oh, yeh?

                               CARL
                     Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess
                     a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in
                     my closet.

                               KABUO (very softly)
                     You can have it.  The hell with it.

     The look between them now.  Is very wonderful.  In the subtlety of
     its connection.

                               CARL
                     $1200 an acre, that's what I paid
                     Ole, won't take a dime less.  You
                     got no choice on that.

                               KABUO
                     Didn't say I was buyin' did I?
                     What you want down?  Just bein'
                     curious, is all.

     The handkerchief comes away from Carl's palm.  And rising, his hand
     extends toward the smaller man.

                               CARL
                     A thousand down.  We'll sign
                     papers t'morrow.

     The hands grip.  And they hold.  And the length of this clasp, and
     the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment.
     Wash years away.

                               KABUO
                     Eight hundred.  And it's a deal.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on eyes.  They are Asian.  Unblinking.

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     For the life of me, sir, I cannot
                     imagine why you kept this story from
                     the sheriff.

     PULL BACK to see Kabuo in the witness box.  Ramrod straight.  Face
     composed.

                               KABUO
                     As my wife testified, we were
                     considering it.

                               HOOKS
                     Actually, she said you had decided.
                     Decided not not come forward.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     I was thinking about it.  Every
                     minute.

                               HOOKS
                     Except even when Sheriff Moran
                     arrested you.  You said nothing
                     about seeing Carl.

     Turns to the jury.  Openly bewildered.

                               HOOKS
                     At that point, you were already
                     under suspicion.  The battery story
                     explained things.  If the story was
                     true...and not simply something you
                     thought up later...

     Turns back.  To the defendant.

                               HOOKS
                     Why.  Didn't you.  Tell it?

     No reaction from the defendant.  Nothing anyone can see.

                               KABUO
                     Sheriff said right off, I was
                     under suspicion.  I didn't have
                     a lawyer...

                               HOOKS
                     But even after you had an
                     attorney.  You still claimed to
                     know nothing.  Claimed not to
                     have seen Carl. Am I correct?

     A beat.

                               KABUO
                     Yes.  Initially.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, 'initially' is an interesting
                     word, sir.  You'd been arrested,
                     you had a lawyer, and you still
                     claimed ignorance!

     Silence.

                               KABUO
                     I should have told everything
                     right away.  I know that now,
                     and I regret it.

                               HOOKS
                     Should have told 'everything'.
                     Meaning, you should have told
                     the truth.

     We can just discern the anger.  At the edge of Kabuo's steady gaze.
     Silence.

                               HOOKS
                     Nothing to say?

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     I didn't know that was a question.
                     It sounded like a speech.

     And Hooks smiles.  Loving it.  Walks toward the witness, stalking
     him.

                               HOOKS
                     My apologies.  Do you regret
                     not telling the truth?

                               KABUO
                     I have told the truth.

                               HOOKS
                     You mean, this morning.  The
                     new story, the battery story.
                     That one is the truth?  That's
                     a question, sir.

                               KABUO (even quieter)
                     Yes.  And I told it long before
                     this morning.

                               HOOKS
                     I see.  Now what happened the
                     day Carl Heine was found?  Before
                     your arrest.

                               KABUO
                     I slept til one-thirty, when my
                     wife woke me up with the news.  We
                     talked for a few hours.  I left at
                     six and went straight to my boat.

                               HOOKS
                     Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands,
                     no purchases?  Just straight to the
                     boat.  That's the truth.

                               KABUO
                     Yes.

     Hooks leans over the box.  Ever so slightly invading Kabuo's space.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, the sheriff found two batteries
                     in your well.  If you left one with
                     Carl Heine, how is that possible?

                               KABUO
                     I had a spare battery in my shed.
                     I brought it down, and put it in
                     just before the sheriff showed up.

     Ah.  I see.

                               HOOKS
                     Conveniently, in your shed.  Only
                     you didn't mention that a moment ago.
                     Why does this battery story change
                     every time a new question is raised?

     Kabuo looks at him, evenly.

                               KABUO
                     You asked if I went straight to the
                     boat.  I did.  With the battery.

     Hooks steps back.  Looks the witness over.

                               HOOKS
                     You're a hard man to trust, sir.

                     that count for something, or sit
                     down and be done with it.

     Silence.  The judge staring hard.  Hooks never flinching.

                               JUDGE
                     Shame on you.

     Hooks turns his eyes to Kabuo.  Stares him down, so the jury can
     watch Kabuo's implacable stare in return.  And softly...

                               HOOKS
                     I apologize to the court, for
                     letting my feelings get the
                     better of me.

                     No other questions.  We'll go to
                     summation.

     As he returns to his table.  As Kabuo steps down from the box.
     We PAN...

     ...reporters' row.  The boys are writing as fast as their hands can
     move.  Only Ishmael is not writing at all.  He stares at the pad

     One word circled.  The word 'lantern'.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Alvin Hooks stalks the jury box now.  Prowls before them along the
     rail.  As their eyes follow.

                               HOOKS
                     ...believing that Etta Heine's son
                     would never sell him the land.  Land
                     that in his mind, filtered through
                     ancient rules of behavior handed down
                     from his ancestors' culture, belonged
                     to his family by right...

     Stops.  To make sure they understand.

                               HOOKS
                     His only choice to get the land
                     would be to eliminate Carl Heine.
                     So that Ole Jurgensen would need
                     a new buyer.

     Pacing again, hand trailing along the rail...

                               HOOKS
                     In his mind.  Seen through codes
                     of revenge difficult for us to
                     fathom, this was also the only way
                     to avenge what he felt to be the
                     grievous dishonor brought to his
                     father, his family...

                               HOOKS
                     As Carl pulled alongside: 'Please,
                     Carl,' the defendant must have said.
                     'I am sorry for what has come between
                     us, but adrift here in the fog, I
                     plead for your help!'

     Imagine.  Imagine that.

                               HOOKS
                     And so this good man tied his
                     boat fast, while his enemy leaps
                     aboard, striking the treacherous
                     blow he was trained to strike by
                     his father's hand.

     Counting off the facts.  One finger at a time.

                               HOOKS
                     The feud over these seven acres
                     had festered for eight years.  He
                     argued with Carl about buying the
                     land one week before Carl was killed.
                     Carl's skull was crushed, and his

                               HOOKS
                     And after a series of lies.  The
                     defendant at last admits he was
                     there.  Alone on the boat.  In
                     the fog.  Carl Heine's blood on
                     his fishing gaff.

     A hush.  A murmur...

                               HOOKS
                     My lord.  My lord.

     Looking into the eyes now.  Of each man.  Each woman.

                               HOOKS
                     Look clearly at the defendant.
                     See the truth self-evident in him.
                     And in the facts of this case.

     And turns.  So that they will follow his eyes to Kabuo's stone-
     hard gaze.

                               HOOKS
                     Look into his eyes, ladies and
                     gentlemen, consider his face.
                     And ask yourself what your duty

                     Now here in America.  We relish
                     those chances.  Give us that one,
                     we say.  That's why we built this
                     country in the first place.

     One step back.  Just above a whisper...

                               NELS
                     Be Americans.  Make your

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     CLOSE on handcuffs SNAPPING into place.  Sheriff Moran checks their
     snugness about Kabuo's wrists, as the crowd mills through the
     courtroom in the wake of adjournment.  Grasping Kabuo's arm, Moran
     begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the
     witness box.  But...

     ...someone is there.  In the doorway.  And Moran's grip tightens as
     they approach...

                               MORAN
                     I'm awful sorry, Ma'am, but you
                     know I c...

                               HATSUE
                     What are you afraid of, Sheriff?

     The edge on that, the ballsy undertone, throws him a little.

                               HATSUE
                     Am I going to slip him a weapon
                     for a mad escape?  Perhaps a kendo
                     staff hidden in my dress?

                               MORAN
                     There's rules.

                               HATSUE
                     Well, please break them, then.
                     I won't keep you a moment.

     And she reaches past him.  To take her husband's hands.  She looks
     in his eyes, as if they are alone.

                               HATSUE
                     I love you.  And tomorrow, when
                     I make our bed.  I'm setting out
                     your pillow.

     Tears just flood her eyes.  Sudden, unbidden.  She holds tight to
     her smile.  And to his hands.

                               HATSUE (whispers)
                     You better be there.

     He smiles.  A lovely, easy, cowboy-American smile.

                               KABUO
                     Only if you ask me nice.

     ANGLE...from the gallery.  One man watches.  Watches as a woman
     brings manicled hands to her lips.  And walks quickly away...

     ...toward us.  Straight toward us, in fact.  And when she stands
     before us, her hands mangle her purse.  The eyes are hollow, flint-
     edged.

                               HATSUE
                     Did you write that column?

                               ISHMAEL
                     I did.  But the jury won't s...

                               HATSUE
                     It's not for the.  They only
                     get to convict him.

     She arches her throat.  As if facing a firing squad.

                               HATSUE
                     It's the judge who decides.  If
                     he'll hang.

     He reaches.  His fingertips find her shoulder.  She does not resist
     his touch.

                               ISHMAEL (gently)
                     None of that is gonna ha...

                               HATSUE
                     You don't think he did this.

     His hand comes away.  From his heart...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I know he didn't.

     She nods.  Nods.  Her eyes filling.  Moving over his face.

                               HATSUE
                     Come to supper, tonight.  My
                     mother would be proud to have
                     you with us.

     He hears the emotion in her voice.  He swallows hard.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I can't.

     No, I can't.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Tell your mom.  I want a rain check.

     INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT

     Kabuo sits on the cot, the way we have always seen him.  Alone in
     his mind.  Footfalls.  Kabuo oblivious, far away.  The door CLANGS
     open.

                               MORAN
                     You have a visitor, son.

     Turns to the visitor...

                               MORAN
                     You said three minutes.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Won't take two.

     And Moran leaves.  The door CLANGS shut.  They are alone.  Only one
     man smiling...

                               KABUO
                     Please, sit down...

     But the tall man doesn't.  Doesn't move.

                               KABUO
                     She told me you're writing a
                     column.  We're very grateful.

     Ishmael nods, awkwardly.  Acknowledging this.

                               KABUO
                     She.  Said you two go way back...

     Ishmael stares into Kabuo's earnest smile.

                               KABUO
                     That's nice.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You said there was a lantern
                     in his hand.  When you found
                     him in the fog.

     Kabuo blinks.  The man's tone is formal.  As if the offer of
     friendliness is somehow rejected.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And another one.  Lashed to
                     the mast?

     Kabuo's own smile has faded.  The mask has returned.

                               KABUO
                     That's right.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Two.  Lanterns.

     And Kabuo grins.  In spite of himself.

                               KABUO
                     If I did the math right.

     Ishmael leans back.  Against the door.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's the sheriff's math.  I'm
                     wondering about.

     INT. SOMMENSEN'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Blackness.  The sound of wind.  Of water lapping at wood.  CLICK of
     a key, springing a lock.  The SCRAPE of a large PADLOCK sliding
     away.  A door CREAKS open, and from the sound of it, a large one.

     Gray light seeps in.

                               MORAN (O.S.)
                     Blackmail.  That's all it is.

     See them now.  Three SILHOUETTES framed in thr barn's open doorway.
     Against the night sky.

                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)
                     I call it keeping your promise.
                     We said if I ever needed some
                     cooperation from you...

     A soft CLICK, and the LIGHTS go on.  Such as they are.  A few
     bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle
     enclosure.  A 50-year-old mildewed barn, built of creosoted
     timbers.  This is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors
     facing the harbor.

     Two BOATS are tied to wide-elbowed piers.  We've seen them before.

                               MORAN
                     You threatened me, Chambers, pure
                     and simple.  And what idiot's gonna
                     believe some cock and bull story
                     that I made a deal to keep stuff
                     outta your paper?  Not that anybody
                     reads your paper.

     Abel Martenson leads the way.  Along soaking planks.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Same idiots who'll believe you
                     cracked this case.  When I tell
                     'em you did.

     Moran snorts.  Points up to the cross spar, high on the mast of the
     first boat.

                               MORAN
                     See, no lantern.

                               ABEL (respectfully)
                     Sheriff?  That's Miyamoto's boat.

     Oh.  Moran swings his gaze up to the second boat.

                               MORAN (quiet triumph)
                     No lantern there, neither.

     Sure enough.  No lantern on the cross spar.  They keep walking.

                               MORAN
                     Never shoulda given you that
                     inventory in the first place.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's public record.  If the public
                     cares enough to read it.

     They step across the gunnel.  Onto Carl Heine's boat.  Flashlights
     working against the dim, eerie glow of distant bulbs, they enter
     Carl's cabin.

     Neat as a pin.  Ishmael scans the floor.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You said there was a coffee c...

                               ABEL (sorry)
                     I picked it up.

     And points to the cup.  Sitting on the counter.

                               ABEL
                     It's the only thing I moved, I
                     swear.  It was right there.

     The sheriff glares at the boy.

                               MORAN
                     You wanna see that in the papers?
                     Don't ever touch something at a cri...

     And stops.  Because Ishmael's gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern.
     In the corner.

                               MORAN
                     One lantern.  Like the inventory
                     says.  Sorry to disappoint you.

     But Ishmael is out the door.  Shining his flashlight.  Up the mast.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Actually.  I was hoping you got
                     it right.  What's that, up there?

     And they all squint up.  Shining their lights together.  Along the
     cross spar.

                               MORAN
                     Nothin'.  Bits of string.

     That's what it looks like.  Many of them.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Pieces of twine aren't nothing.

     And he steps to the base of the mast.  Puts the flashlight in his
     pocket.  Wraps his arm around the shaft of wood.

                               MORAN
                     Here now, what are you fixin'
                     to do?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Have a look.  At nothing.

     And wrapping his legs around the mast, he hoists himself up.

                               MORAN
                     You can't go up there, touch things...

     With all his strength.  Ishmael begins to climb.

                               ISHMAEL (grunting)
                     Trial's over, Sheriff, it's with
                     the jury now.

     Supporting himself with his legs, he struggles upward.

                               MORAN
                     You gonna climb that with one arm?

                               ISHMAEL
                     You're right.  I better use two.

     Up he goes, inching his way, Abel shining his flashlight.  Moran
     swings his beam up, too.

                               ABEL
                     There's lots of 'em, Art, look.

     And Moran is looking.  Saying nothing.  Now, Ishmael is there.

                               ISHMAEL
                     A dozen or more, all figure eights.
                     All cut clean through on an angle.

                               ABEL
                     And look at that streak of rust,
                     across the mast.

     His light playing on it.  Bracing his full weight with his legs,
     Ishmael fingers the scraps of rope...

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's on the twine, too.  But it's
                     not r...

                               MORAN
                     Don't prove there was two lanterns.
                     Coulda been the one in the cabin.

     Still supporting  himself with his legs, Ishmael pulls out his
     flashlight...

                               ISHMAEL
                     There's a stretch of ground
                     between guessin' and provin',
                     Sheriff.  I'll give you that.

     ...shines it DOWN on the deck.  Along the gunnel.  Just below the
     mast.  And as we watch the circle of light move...

                               MORAN (O.S.)
                     What do you think you're lookin'
                     at now?

     Still moving.  And in the silence, an absent...

                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)
                     Not what I'm looking at.  It's
                     what I'm looking for.

     INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT

     Eleven citizens around a walnut table.  Eleven.  Glaring at the
     twelfth.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     Well.  I guess it comes down to
                     a feeling, don't it?  If I feel
                     uncertain, I feel a doubt.  Isn't
                     that it?

     And the boat builder smiles amicably, rubs his gray beard.  No
     other smiles.  Anywhere.

                               HAROLD JENSEN
                     Alex, nobody ain't ever sure about
                     nothin'.  It's unreasonable to be so
                     stubborn that you think you're smarter
                     than eleven folks who all agree!

                               EDITH TWARDZIK
                     The man sat there and admitted he
                     lied, Mr. Van Ness.  Now why isn't
                     that enough for you?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     We're not tryin' him for lying.  Lots
                     of us told lies, one time or another.
                     Prob'ly none of us murdered anybody.

                               HAROLD JENSEN
                     But what drives a man to lie?
                     Means he's hiding somethin'.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     Not necessarily that he killed
                     Carl.  I'm not sayin' you're wrong,
                     just that I have my doubts.

                               BURKE LATHAM
                     Look, if you changed chairs right
                     now, cos you doubted that maybe a
                     chunk of the moon was gonna fall
                     through the roof, that wouldn't be
                     a reasonable doubt.

     Folks turn to Burke.  What the hell are you talking about?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS (laughs)
                     Okay, you win that one.  Now can
                     we all go to bed?

                               HARLAN McQUEEN
                     The mooring line.  Doesn't that
                     tell you something?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     I think it does.  Miyamoto was on
                     Carl's boat, or vice-versa.  Not
                     much doubt about th...

                               MARLAN McQUEEN
                     And Carl's blood on the gaff?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     There's a chance it came from his
                     hand.

                               BURKE LATHAM
                     There's a chance of everything.
                     But you add a chance from here and
                     a chance from there, the world ain't
                     made a coincidences only.

     Everyone agrees.  Almost everyone.

                               EDITH TWARDZIK
                     Look, if he gave Carl a battery
                     like he said, he'd only a had one
                     left.  Not two.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     He explained that.  He replaced it.

                               HARLAN McQUEEN
                     Only he threw that part in when he
                     got cornered.  But first time around,
                     he never mentioned it.

                               ROGER PORTER
                     Alex, stop arguin' just to argue.
                     You can see what really happened,
                     same as us.  Isn't that what we're
                     supposed to do is tell the actual
                     truth?  My God, Carl died, here.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     So I don't care Carl died, unless
                     I'm ready to reach for the hangman's
                     rope?  You oughta stop tryin' to
                     bully me into hurrying.

     Little anger in that.  It brings a silence.

                               BURKE LATHAM
                     Been six hours.  You sayin' there's
                     a way to go slower?

     INT. NELS' KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

     Nels in a ratty, frayed old robe, pouring hot water from a kettle
     into mismatched cups.  His hair is wispy and wild, his eyes puffy.
     He COUGHS horrible.  CLEARS his throat...

                               NELS
                     Well.  It's imaginative...

     And drops tea bags into the cups with a splash.

                               NELS
                     ...I'll give you that.

     Lisps over to the cluttered table.  Where his guest is waiting.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's the way it happened, I know
                     it is.

                               NELS
                     No, you don't.

     Nels sits.  Slowly.  Ishmael removes his bag.  Sips his tea.

                               NELS
                     That report.  About the freighter?
                     You didn't find that tonight, did you?

     No answer.  Ishmael keeps sipping.  Holding eye contact.

                               NELS
                     You went right to the cell.  Then
                     to the boat.  Then here.  How long
                     did you know about the freighter?

                               ISHMAEL (just above a whisper)
                     One day.

     Nels' turn.  To sip his tea.

                               NELS
                     This tastes horrible, hmmn?

                               ISHMAEL
                     You're wondering why I held it.

                               NELS
                     I'm wondering how the judge is
                     gonna like my waking up his old
                     bones.  in the middle of the night.

     And he smiles.  A wonderful smile.

                               NELS
                     Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Yes, he was.

     Another sip.

                               NELS
                     He's looking down.  And he's not
                     thinking 'bout the man you were
                     yesterday.  He's proud of the man
                     you are tonight.  That's what counts.

                               ISHMAEL
                     To my father.  Everything counts.

     Nels watches the pain in that.

                               NELS
                     What if I told you he once said
                     to me...don't matter the road we
                     take.  Just so we get there.

                               ISHMAEL (smiles)
                     Then you'd be lying.

                               NELS
                     Doesn't make me wrong.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     The jury once more in the jury box.  PAN their faces.  The faces we
     saw last night.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     All right, let's say that twine
                     had been there to lash a lantern.
                     That it had come from the shuttle of
                     twine found in the deceased's pocket.

     Edith Twardzik.  Burke Latham.  Alexander Van Ness.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Now to re-open a trial that had
                     gone to jury...new evidence should
                     be pretty important.

     See Ishmael.  Quiet, intense.  On the witness stand.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Tell us why that lantern would be
                     so significant.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well.  It shows the prosecutor was
                     wrong.  It was Carl's boat that was
                     dead in the water.  Or he'd never
                     have put up the lantern.

     Nels thinks about that.  So the jury will, too.

                               NELS
                     Now you believe there were two
                     lanterns when defendant arrived.
                     One in Carl's hand.  The second
                     lashed to the mast.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported,
                     and he'd have no reason to lie.
                     He couldn't know that it would help
                     his case.

                               NELS
                     Well, why does it?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Because the second lantern, the one
                     on the mast.  Was never found.  So
                     we have to ask...

     A slight shurg.  Stating the obvious.

                               ISHMAEL
                     ...where did it go?

     And then...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe it went.  Where Carl went.
                     Over the side.

                               HOOKS
                     Objection!  Speculation.

     Nels smiles his grandfather smile.

                               NELS
                     Your Honor, all of this is
                     speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks'
                     dramaturgy about the defendant
                     issuing a false distress call.

                               HOOKS
                     Tht was summation, Your H...

                               JUDGE (gently)
                     Overruled, Alvin.  Let's hear
                     this, hmmn?

     Nels Gudmundsson nods to himself.  Takes a stroll over to the jury
     box.  No limp today.  Something has put some spring in his step.

                               NELS
                     So how does this fit with what
                     you told us at the start?  The
                     freighter that plowed through
                     Ship Channel Bank...

     And turns.  Leaning his scrawny butt against the jury's rail.
     He'll watch this with them now.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's when he fell.

                               NELS
                     Fell.

     Ishmael settles in.  Here we go.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Miyamoto gave him the battery, and
                     left.  Carl's boat was running, he
                     goes back to fishing.  But at some
                     point, he thinks of the lantern...

                               NELS
                     Still lashed to the mast.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He figures a perfectly good
                     lantern could get banged around
                     up there.  So he climbs up.  To
                     cut it down.

                               NELS
                     Just as the freighter comes through?
                     Isn't that quite a coincidence?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Coincidences happen.  You run a
                     yellow light just as a car comes
                     out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy
                     happens every day.  Or maybe...

                               NELS
                     Maybe...?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe Carl picks up something about
                     the freighter on his radio, which is
                     now working.  Same report Milholland
                     heard.  And that makes him get the
                     lantern fast.  Before the freighter's
                     wake can bang it around.

                               NELS
                     But you could be wrong.  He could
                     have climbed up earlier.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Then where's the lantern?  And
                     where's the knife?

                               NELS
                     The knife.  What knife?

     As if he really has forgotten.  As if he wants to know.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Coroner found an empty knife sheath
                     on Carl's belt.  But they never
                     found the knife.

     He's nodding.  Yes, that's right.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He climbs up.  His hand wound still
                     bleeding.  That's the blood I found
                     on the mast.  And the twine.

     Nels' eyes are rapt.  His mouth is shut.  No way he interrupts this
     roll.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He cuts the lantern free, the
                     freighter's wake hits, the boat
                     rolls hard, his bloody hand slips.
                     tracing blood along the mast...

     A hush.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He falls.  The lantern, the knife,
                     go into the water.  Same as Carl.

     The words hang there.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And inside the cabin, a coffee
                     cup falls off the counter.

     Shakes his head.

                               ISHMAEL
                     But there's no one around.  To
                     pick it up.

     Nels ponders.  Puts his hand to his chin.

                               NELS
                     Still a coincidence.  Timing
                     and all.

                               ISHMAEL
                     The freighter started through
                     at 1:42.  The sea water seeped
                     into Carl's watch and stopped it.
                     At 1:47.

     CUT to the defendant.  Ramrod straight, nothing revealed in his
     face.  And to his wife.  Elegant, erect.  Her eyes flooded with
     tears.

                               NELS
                     Still and all.  Carl was a strong
                     swimmer, he m...

                               ISHMAEL
                     He hit his head.  On the way in.

     Silence.

                               NELS
                     You think so?

                               ISHMAEL
                     The sheriff and the deputy and I
                     inspected the deck closely.  We
                     found a small fracture in the wood
                     of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.

                               NELS
                     Well, anything coulda caused that.

     Ishmael nods.  No smile at all.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Anything.  That had a blond hair.

     And Nels is walking now.  Toward the prosecutor's table.  Pulling a
     small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket.

                               NELS
                     Request introduction of Exhibit 18.
                     One single blond hair.  Which Sheriff
                     Moran dug out of that fracture.  Below
                     the mast.  Of Carl Heine's boat.

     Lays the bag on the table.  Just in front of Hooks.  Turns to the
     judge.

                               NELS
                     We will call Sheriff Moran, who
                     will confirm this.  And Coroner
                     Whaley to testify that the damage
                     to the gunnel is of a size and
                     nature not inconsistent with the
                     deceased's skull fracture...

     Turns to the prosecutor...

                               NELS
                     But for now.  Your witness...

     And just strolls on over to his seat.  Looks in his client's eyes.
     How 'bout them apples?  Kabuo loves this old guy.  And right here,
     he lets a little of that show.

     Across the way, the prosector is rising.  He smiles.  Friendly,
     almost amused.

                               HOOKS
                     I have to start reading your
                     paper more closely.  You're quite
                     a storyteller.

                               ISHMAEL (straight back)
                     Thank you.  Coming from the man who
                     wrote, 'But here, adrift in the fog,
                     I plead for your help'...that's quite
                     a compliment.

     There is a ripple of laughter.  But no smile on Ishmael's features.
     His game face is on.  Come and get me, sucker.  And Hooks does
     come, one step at a time.  Straight to the box.

                               HOOKS
                     Everything had to happen just
                     right.  For your little story to
                     fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be
                     on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry, was there a question
                     in there?

     No love lost.  And no pretense about it.  Hatsue Miyamoto sits with
     her hand in her mother's.  Watching these men battle for her
     husband's life.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, the freighter.  The twine.
                     The blood.  The knife.  The cup.
                     The watch.  The second battery.
                     The phantom lantern.  The fishing
                     gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The
                     skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's
                     eleven things...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Twelve.

     Hooks smiles.

                               HOOKS
                     I stand corrected, sir.  And you
                     have a neat explanation for every
                     one of them.

     Hooks nods.  Yes, you do.

                               HOOKS
                     And since you confess this is
                     all pure guesswork.  What is your
                     expertise, sir, are you a detective
                     of sorts?

                               ISHMAEL
                     My expertise.  Is that I'm a
                     journalist.

     Right at his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And journalism.  Is balance.  Finding
                     the facts folks need to know.

     The words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot
     fully appreciate.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Then putting them together.  So
                     truth is revealed.

                               HOOKS
                     But isn't the truth that there are
                     several other ways to explain each
                     of these twelve pieces.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Oh, yes.

     And the prosecutor stops.  Confused for an instant by this
     confession.  Until...

                               ISHMAEL
                     But no other way.  To explain
                     them all.

     A heart-stopping hush.  As everyone, as Hooks himself, sees the
     cehckmate.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And since they all happened.
                     This is the only explanation
                     that's the truth.

     The prosecutor looks like he's been slapped.  Like every act of
     will is necessary to maintain composure.  To find the easy,
     untroubled smile.

                               HOOKS
                     Your line of work.  You must meet
                     a lot of men play fast and loose
                     with the truth.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Like you couldn't believe.

     Service returned.  Hooks leans in.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, the defendant is a liar.
                     He's confessed that much.  And his
                     explanation is...he was afraid.

     And leans in some more.

                               HOOKS
                     Afraid that the good folks of
                     this jury.  Would be too stupid
                     to understand.  Too prejudiced
                     to be fair.

     Shakes his head.

                               HOOKS
                     You buy that?

                               ISHMAEL (gently)
                     I think he was greedy.

     And once more.  The prosecutor can only blink.  Can only move
     toward the trap.

                               HOOKS
                     Greedy.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He didn't want to lose any more.

     No smile.  No smile as the trap springs shut.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He'd lost a lot in the war, you
                     see.  I had sent him away.  To a
                     concentration camp.  But a nice
                     one.  Far less brutal than the Nazis.
                     Because I'm a civilized person.

     He stops.  Lets Hooks clear his throat.

                               HOOKS
                     I asked you a question, you're writing
                     a tract, h...

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's how journalists.  Answer
                     questions.

     Turns to Judge Fielding.  With all respect...

                               ISHMAEL
                     May I answer the question, Your
                     Honor?  Anout the defendant's
                     motivation to lie?

                               JUDGE
                     I wouldn't miss it for the world,
                     son.  Now, you say you sent the
                     defendant to Manzanar?

                               ISHMAEL
                     I didn't say.  I did it alone.

     And things get real quiet.

                               ISHMAEL
                     So there he was.  His father lost
                     his health there, finally died.
                     They lost more than Etta Heine's
                     seven acres.  They lost their
                     liberty, their dignity.  Their
                     ideals about this country.

     So much feeling in this.  He has to stop.  Swallow hard.

                               ISHMAEL
                     They lost their trust in us.  We
                     had treated them worse than animals.
                     How would we now see tham.  As human
                     beings?

     Tells the jury.  Straight to their faces.

                               ISHMAEL
                     This man lost a lot in the war.
                     He didn't want now to lose his
                     babies.  Or the woman who loves him.

     Another level of quiet.  He turns to the prosecutor...

                               ISHMAEL
                     And my expertise in this, sir.  Is
                     that I lost a lot in the war myself.

     Words coming from someplace very deep.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And the fact that I am the only
                     witness.  Who placed his right hand
                     upon the Holy Bible.  Is the least
                     of it, sir.  I assure you of that.

     Silence.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, sir.  I hate to spoil the
                     soliloquy, I truly do.  But the
                     fact is...you are not on trial here.
                     Nor is Judge Fielding, or myself.
                     Nor the good people of this jury.
                     For events that took place twelve
                     years ago.

     No sir.

                               HOOKS
                     And I wouldn't blame these good
                     people if they were a mite resent-
                     ful.  At a tactic that insults
                     their intelligence.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's curious.  I was appealing
                     to their intelligence.

                               HOOKS
                     Were you, sir?  Can you prove one
                     word of all your fancy story?

                               ISHMAEL
                     No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a
                     reasonable doubt.

     And he smiles.  First time.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's fortunate that the man who
                     needs to prove his fancy story.
                     Beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is
                     someone else.

     There is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve
     the tension.  The gavel BANGS.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry, Mr. Hooks.  I apologize
                     for my tone.  This is not a contest.
                     Between you and me.

     Shakes his head.  No, it isn't.

                               ISHMAEL
                     For it is not.  As Mr. Gudmundsson
                     so wisely put it.  A small trial.
                     In a small place.

     His eyes are damp now.  Strangely enough, after all this.  He is at
     last on the brink of losing control.  Because...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I lost more in that war than
                     anyone will ever know.  So did
                     a lot of folks.  And what we got
                     back in return...

     His voice breaks slightly.  But it rings with dignity on...

                               ISHMAEL
                     ...was a country.  Where a man
                     was innocent.  Until we proved
                     him guilty.

     And the voice drops.  To just above a whisper...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Whether we all got cheated.
                     We're about to find out.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

     CLOSE on Hatsue Miyamoto, speaking earnestly, her eyes down, her
     purse in her lap, her slender hands expressing the intensity of her
     feelings as she makes her point, and we...

     PULL BACK to reveal that she is on a corridor bench, surrounded by
     a half dozen REPORTERS, who are crouching, standing, scribbling
     away.  Two PHOTOGRAPHERS pop flashes that she does not seem to
     notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we...

     PULL BACK, down the hallway to the POV of a man who sits alone,
     unnoticed.  There is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only
     hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the
     pristine cellophane.  His eyes are fixed to hatsue, holding court
     at a distance.  Fixed, as if no other sight could ever command this
     level of attention.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     All things considered...

     Hearing the voice, Ishmael looks down.  Uneasy to have been caught
     staring so intently.

                               NELS
                     ...you were adequate.

     No smile accompanies the irony.  For that would be condescending.

                               NELS
                     I could make a few quibbles, but
                     I am loathe to hurt your feelings.

     The old man sits.  Very slowly.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Cigarette?

                               NELS
                     I'll take two.  One for later.

     Ishmael tries to tear the cellophane without success.  Nels seems
     not even to notice.

                               NELS (quietly)
                     She is simply.  Beautiful.

     Ishmael's eyes cut to him.  A little quickly.  Confides...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I've always thought so.

     There it sits.  His fingers claw absently at the cellophane.  Nels
     makes no move to intervene.

                               NELS
                     If I whistle.  Those boys'll see
                     you, and come runnin'.  You're
                     the story today.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You ever been strangled by a
                     single hand?

                               NELS
                     Naw, I've seen what that can do
                     to a pack of cigarettes.

     Comfortable together.  In this hour of discomfort.  Ishmael brings
     the corner of the pack to his teeth, and tears the cellophane away.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Better take three...

     Fingers nimbly shred the seal, open the pack.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe they'll keep us waiting.

     Shake the tips free.  Holds the pack forward.

                               NELS (very quiet)
                     Maybe they won't.

     The way he said that.  Subtly ominous.  Ishmael watching Nels'
     face, as the old man takes two cigarettes...

                               NELS
                     Prejudice is like any obsession.

     Tucks one in his pocket.  And his eyes slide, unmistakably, to
     Hatsue.

                               NELS
                     There's a reason why we can't
                     let go.  Even when we want to.

     Ishmael is stone still.  Nels just gazing at Hatsue.  Until...

                               ISHMAEL
                     A reason.

                               NELS (simply)
                     We don't want to.

     Looks back to Ishmael.  Very straight.

                               NELS
                     Hate or love.  It works the same.

     In the silence...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Your client's wife ever mention?
                     We go way ba...

                               NELS (softly)
                     Her mother.  May have said
                     something.

     There it is.  Kindness in this old man's face.  He brings the other
     cigarette to his lips.  And Ishmael takes out the match box.  Never
     breaking eye contact.

                               ISHMAEL
                     We don't let go, you s...

                               NELS
                     It's a rare thing.  Takes a
                     turning point.

     Expertly, Ishmael's fingers withdaw a match.

                               NELS
                     You gave this jury three chances.
                     To turn.

     Palming the box, Ishmael STRIKES the match.  On his belt buckle...

                               NELS
                     No other way to explain it all.
                     That was one.  I caught some of
                     'em fluttering, waking up, on that.

     Reaches the flame toward the old man...

                               NELS
                     Second.  You sent him to
                     Manzanar, and you didn't do
                     it alone.  I liked that one,
                     they didn't.  No surprise.

     Nels leans to the flame.  Sucks it in.  Savors a drag.

                               NELS
                     Last.  You gave your arm.  To
                     buy this woman back her husband.
                     Are they gonna cheat you out of that?

                               BAILIFF (O.S., calling out)
                     JURY'S COMIN' IN...

     Everywhere, the buzz RISES, there is motion an expectation.  But
     Nels doesn't seem to notice.

                               NELS
                     Some let go, some don't.  Where
                     did you?

     Asked so casually.  Ishmael turns.  Hatsue is standing now,
     surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     Hooks called her deceitful.
                     And I knew she wasn't.

     He's watching her.  Across the way.  So intently.

                               ISHMAEL
                     She was an honest person.  Doing
                     the best she could.

     We follow her approach toward the courtroom door.  She has not yet
     turned to us.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     The prosecutor, the judge, cut
                     her off.  She was desperate.  Her
                     husband helpless...I was helpless...

     Nels rises.  With great effort.

                               NELS
                     You couldn't let her.  Be
                     helpless.

     Ishmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her
     mother's murmurings, as she...

     ...disappears through the door.  Never having looked our way.

                               NELS
                     When this verdict is read.  She
                     may look for your face.

     And Ishmael's eyes come up.  Because the voice commands it.

                               NELS
                     Here's what she needs to see:  This
                     is nothing.  We win it on appeal.

     The old man is stern and strong.  He wants a promise.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It'll be there.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     The hush of a hundred silences.  We can feel the air crackle in the
     stillness.  Judge Fielding is leafing through papers.  No one
     coughs, no one blinks...

                               JUDGE (clears his throat)
                     Mister foreman, has the jury
                     reached a verdict?

     He looks up.  Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury
     box.

                               HAROLD JENSEN
                     We have, Your Honor.

     And holds out a slip of paper.  Little more than a scrap.  Folded
     once.

                               JUDGE
                     Will the bailiff please bring
                     the verdict to the bench.

     The bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the
     limelight.  He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and...

     ...stops.  Staring for a hung instant.  As if seeing something
     unexpected.  he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and
     as he hands it back to the bailiff...

                               JUDGE (softly)
                     Will the defendant please rise.

     Kabuo and Nels rise together.  But it is only into the defendant's
     eyes that the judge stares.  No expression in the face of either
     man.  But something passes, all the same.

     As the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we
     SNAP TO...

     REVERSE ANGLE...every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman,
     now opening the slip of paper.

     Every pair.  But one.

                               JUDGE (O.S.)
                     Will the foreman please read the
                     verdict aloud.

     One reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines.
     Toward a woman who does not see him.  In case she needs his eyes.
     To be waiting.

                               HAROLD JENSEN (reads)
                     We the jury, find the defendant,
                     Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not
                     guilty of the cri...

     A sharp SCREAM, and the defendant's mother-in-law covers her mouth
     in embarrassment.

                               HAROLD JENSEN (continues)
                     ...of the crime with which he
                     has been char...

     APPLAUSE breaks out from the back row of the gallery, where
     citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum,
     as has...

     ...a woman who comes OUT of her seat, tears on her face, not
     even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that
     separates her from her husband.  Throughout the gallery, now...

     ...some of the citizens assembled add their applause.  Others look
     awkward, not knowing how to react.

     The gavel lies untouched, unnoticed, by a jurist who has no problem
     with anything that is taking place right now.  Saying only to the
     jury...

                               JUDGE
                     This is your verdict, so say
                     you all?

     As they assent...

                               JUDGE
                     This Court thanks you for the
                     good work you have done under
                     difficult circumstances...

     Reaches STRONG to the gavel, turns to the defendant...

                               JUDGE
                     Go home, son.  God bless.

     CRACKS the gavel on its block.  The defendant is OUT of his chair,
     and with one strong grip of gratitude to the frail shoulder of his
     counsel, he is...

     ...AT the rail, through the POPPING of flashbulbs, she is IN his
     arms, the embrace so FIERCE on both sides, everyone crowding around
     them.

     An old man's eyes sweep the gallery, looking for someone.  Only
     to find...

     ...Ishmael's back.  As he disappears through the door.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - LATER

     The Miyamotos holding court, surrounded by nearly twenty reporters
     and photographers, and countless looky-loo's of all persuasions.
     Hatsue's face is flushed and intense, unsmiling, she seems scarcely
     to have caught her breath.  She holds tight to her husband's hand,
     as he...

     ...carries his baby son in the other arm, his 8-year-old daughter
     leaning against him, her 4-year-old sister standing on the bench
     beside her mom.  Kabuo submits to questions with a boyish grin of
     humility and friendliness.  An American family.  Photogenic as
     hell.

                               REPORTER #1
                     And how about the jury?  You had
                     confidence they'd see justice done?

     Kabuo glances to his lawyer, wanna field this one?  But Nels sends
     it back with a twinkle.

                               KABUO
                     Oh, sure.  These are our neighbors,
                     you know.  They've got good
                     hearts.  We could see they were
                     following the evidence real close...

     At his side, Hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces...

                               KABUO
                     We're just grateful to every one
                     of them.

     ...looking for something she doesn't find.

                               REPORTER #2
                     And you ma'am?  You felt the same
                     as your husband, I expect?

     Her eyes move to the eager young man.  She reflects for a beat.

                               HATSUE
                     Honestly, no.

     Which catches everyone.  A little short.

                               HATSUE (quietly)
                     I felt my husband would be found
                     guilty.  Unless proven innocent.

     No apologies for the truth.  That's not her way.

                               HATSUE
                     And Mr. Chambers did that.

     INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT

     A vending machine stands in silence.  The eerie strobing glow of
     defective neon.  PULL BACK as...

     Ishmael thinks it over.  Drops in his dime.  Pulls the plunger, to
     watch a Snickers fall.  Scoops the candy from the tray, pins it
     between his body and the machine.

     ...tears the wrapper.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR

     BACK to the reporters.  The crowd of onlookers has grown.

                               REPORTER #3
                     ...can we get some background on
                     your handsome family?  I understand
                     you two were childhood sweethearts...

     And brings his Parker pen to his notepad.  His subject smiles
     easily...

                               KABUO
                     Well, no sir, not exactly.  We met
                     in the Manzanar camp, you see, so I
                     guess that was the most beautiful
                     place I've ever been.

     There is gentle laughter.  And as Kabuo looks up, he sees something
     in the rear of the crowd.  Something we do not.  And softly...

                               KABUO
                     No, her first love was another
                     fella...

     Which brings Hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze.  And there, in
     the back.  A man watches.  Eating a candy bar.

                               KABUO (O.S.)
                     I was the lucky one.

     No one sees their eyes lock.  It is only an instant.

     It is enough.

                               REPORTER #4
                     It all sounds very romantic,
                     ma'am.  Falling in love under
                     those circumstances...

     And as she looks to the reporter, Ishmael begins to walk away...

                               HATSUE
                     He went off to the Army, right
                     from Manzanar.  And that last
                     night, we danced alone in the
                     desert...

     And somehow, Ishmael catches the eye of Hatsue's 4-year-old
     daughter.  So he pulls a coin from his pocket...

                               HATSUE (O.S.)
                     I told him.  If you don't come
                     back alive, I'll kill you.

     ...Ishmael ROLLS the coin across his knuckles.  And the child
     responds...

     With her mother's smile.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DUSK

     Alone on the steps where the Strawberry Princess once winked at
     him.  Snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful.  He
     squints up...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     God's kindness, my father said.
                     Despite the hardship...it reminds
                     us.  Of our place in things.

     Our place in things.  He slides a black cigar between his teeth...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     What the hell.  Did he mean
                     by that?

     He has the match box.  Manipulating it with the dexterity we've
     come to know.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Things fall on us, I suppose.
                     From the sky.

     STRIKES the match on his belt buckle...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Wars.  Freighters plowing through...

     Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the
     cigar.  A single puff.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     And we seem...helpless.  Until we
                     understand.

     One more.  Savors it.  The sky.  The thought.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Accident rules every corner of
                     the universe...

     Down the steps.  Snow swirling between us.  Gone.

                     Except the chambers.  Of the

     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT

     Fog.  Penetrated only by sound.  The LAPPING of sea at a drifting
     hull.  Tendrils of mist part, revealing...

     ...a face.  Strong and blond and handsome.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  SEPTEMBER 15, 1954

     LONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross
     spar of his mast.  He has pulled a SHUTTLE of TWINE from his rubber
     overalls, and is LASHING a LANTERN in the cloud of mist, as MAIN
     TITLES BEGIN...

     ANGLE...the tiny, meticulously neat cabin.  Empty, silent.  A tin
     COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.  The battery well open, revealing
     two large BATTERIES in place.  PAN to...

     ...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.  The fishing net stretched
     from the huge DRUM into the sea.  Keep PANNING to the bow, where...

     ...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching
     as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.  The silhouette of a
     FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.  As fragments of fog part,
     we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see...

     ...his eyes.  They are Asian.  SMASH CUT to...

     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - MORNING

     Blinding sun.  Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water.  As CREDITS
     CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.  SHERIFF ART
     MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.  Only the eyes
     reflect his disquiet.  His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts
     anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.  As the net brings
     silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to...

     ...the cabin.  Tidy as before.  Only two things have changed.
     CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the
     floor.  PAN above the open battery well, where a third MARINE
     BATTERY now stands next to the wheel.  CUT to...

     ...the stern, as the raveling net LIFTS from the water's surface...

     ...the face of Carl Heine.  Turned to the sun.  SMASH CUT to...

     INT. CORONER'S LAB - DAY

     WHITE fills the frame.  A hand PULLS back the blanket-shroud
     revealing Carl's face.  As CREDITS CONTINUE, tilt up to the
     coroner, HORACE WHALEY, gazing down.  A shading of regret behind
     the professional mask.  A series of QUICK CUTS...

     ...Whaley's hand pulls the SHUTTLE of TWINE from Carl's pocket...

     ...examines the open, empty KNIFE SHEATH at Carl's belt...

     ...Carl's wrist, its WATCH stopped at 1:47...

     Whaley bends over Carl's body, presses on his solar plexus,
     watching pink FOAM rise from Carl's mouth and nose.  And then.
     He sees something more.  His fingers gently pull back the hair
     from above Carl's left ear, to reveal...

     ...a skull wound.  The bone caved in.  Four inches across.

     EXT. SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY

     Snow falling on cedars.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  DECEMBER 6.

     The heavens descend softly onto our island.  Exquisite, silent,
     hypnotic.  An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against
     the limitless scope of nature.  As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of
     QUICK ANGLES...

     ...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned
     school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows...

     ...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens
     waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene...

     ...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels
     blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building
     a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water,
     and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes...

     ...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and
     flawless as the Sahara...

     Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can,
     people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we
     FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to...

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on impassive EYES.  They are Asian.  We have seen them
     before.  PULL BACK to see...

     KABUO MIYAMOTO.  Early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt.  He sits
     ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a
     storm of movement in...

     ...the assembling COURTROOM.  A packed gallery of buzzing locals,
     the scent of anticipation.  A bank of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS,
     cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries
     from the civilized world.  As we PAN their ranks...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It was the first murder trial on
                     the island in thirty-one years.

     ...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's,
     dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on
     his right leg.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Our only newspaper was the San
                     Piedro Review, a four-page weekly
                     that I operated alone.

     He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     What, I wondered, could the Seattle
                     boys know of the hearts of these
                     people...

     To the JURY BOX.  Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober
     neckties.  A waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Neighbors, sitting in judgement.
                     On their neighbor.

     To the neighbor.  The ramrod-still defendant.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid
                     grace of a Samurai warrior.  As if
                     detached from his own trial.

     Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee,
     until...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Did he know how dangerous his demeanor
                     could be?  With this jury.

     ...it falls with a CLATTER of pages.  He reaches with his right
     hand, replaces the pad on his thigh.  Around him, CAMERAS are being
     swung to the ready.  Ishmael looks to see...

     ...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom.
     A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable
     box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more,
     unheeded.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Hatsue Miyamoto had been without
                     her husband for 77 days.

     Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad.
     For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated
     left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He was in jail.  When his baby son
                     learned to walk.

     Through his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first
     row.  And sensing her presence, her husband turns.  Their eyes
     meet.  A string of FLASHES...

     But none from Ishmael.  He hesitates.  As if considering whether he
     will violate this woman's privacy.  The camera lowers.  HOLD on his
     face...

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

     MATCH CUT to Hatsue's face.  Staring, impassive, empty.  PULL BACK
     to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door.
     Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap.  Her demeanor as
     removed from this place as is her husband's.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Earlier, I noticed her in the
                     corridor.

     PULL BACK to see him alone, in shadow.  It is more than a notice.
     Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as
     she gathers her thoughts.  A moment of decision.  He approaches.
     Stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her
     personal space.  And softer than we might have imagined...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Are you all right?

     She turns her head only slightly.  It is enough.  Her voice quiet
     and firm at once...

                               HATSUE
                     Go away, Ishmael.

     There is no anger.  Only directness and resolve.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Please don't be like th...

                               HATSUE (softer)
                     Go away.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     PAN the back of the courtroom.  Twenty-four citizens of Japanese
     ancestry fill the last row, dressed in their most formal clothes.
     Shades of Atticus Finch.  As one, the Japanese-Americans watch...

     ...the prosecutor, ALVIN HOOKS, a crisp, even dapper man.  There is
     a quickness about the eyes, a tendency to sharpness of manner, that
     he works carefully against...

                               HOOKS
                     ...four inch gash, skull crushed,
                     and your thought was, what...?

     JUDGE FIELDING, tall and gray and rawboned, leans on his elbows,
     his eyelids droop slightly, a deceptive masking of keen attention.

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     That he...fell?  Hit his head on
                     the gunnel going over?

     The witness is Sheriff Moran.  He answers as if this were a sincere
     question.  As if he had never heard it before.

                               MORAN
                     Well, Carl was six-four, went 235.
                     He was a grizzly bear and an able
                     seaman...

     Ishmael watching.  Thinking on that.

                               MORAN (O.S.)
                     For him to just...go over.  Crush
                     his skull like that on the way in...

     HOLD on Ishmael.

     INT. TEAM BUS - DAY

     Teenage BOYS in football uniforms.  They ride with their helmets in
     their laps.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He was a mountain, all right.
                     Anchored the line for us little
                     fellers.

     CLOSE on Carl and Ishmael at 18, riding together.  Ishmael, dark
     and rugged even then, is scarcely little.  But dwarfed by the blond
     giant at his side, who glares out the window, at...

                               CARL
                     Chambers.  Y'see the geese?

     ...snow geese landing in low flooded wheat.  The grace of it holds
     both boys.

                               CARL
                     Picture'd be nice.  In your pa's
                     paper.

     Ishmael nods absently.  They stare, side-by-side.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Lucky I got the camera in my
                     helmet.

     They never look at each other.  They never smile.  But you can
     almost hear one in...

                               CARL
                     Careful, Chambers.  That was almost
                     a joke.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium.
     Like chatting with the Sheriff across the back fence...

                               HOOKS
                     And you weren't there, when the
                     coroner examined the wound.

                               MORAN
                     Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid...
                     to tell Mrs. Heine.

     And his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the
     prosecutor's table.  Taking the glances of the jury with it.
     SUSAN MARIE HEINE is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her
     modest black dress.  Composure and dignity.  Against her grief.

     EXT. HEINE HOME - DAY

     Moran climbs from his vehicle, as Carl's young SONS dash around the
     corner of the house.  Seeing the Sheriff, they stop cold.  Silent,
     shirtless, barefoot.

                               MORAN
                     Hey there, men.  Is your mother
                     home a-tall?

     He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper.  And as the younger boy
     nods across the distance...

                               SUSAN MARIE (O.S.)
                     Sheriff Moran, hullo.

     She has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle-marked baby's
     diaper across her shoulder.  And he smiles back.  Tells the boys...

                               MORAN
                     You go on and play, now.

     But they don't.  So he follows into her entryway, closing the door
     behind him.  And at the foot of her curving staircase...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     What can I do for you, Sheriff,
                     Carl's not home y...

                               MORAN
                     That's...

     Too quick.  He stops himself.  And she sees that.

                               MORAN
                     It's why I'm here.  I'm afraid I
                     have some...very bad news to tell
                     you, the...worst...kind of news.

     She looks at him, uncomprehending, the smile only beginning to
     fade, before...

                               MORAN
                     Carl died last night.  In a fishing
                     accident.  In White Sand Bay.

     She only blinks.  As if translating the words from a foreign
     language.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     No, Carl's fine, h...

                               MORAN
                     We found him, Mrs. Heine.  Tangled
                     in his net.

     And with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she
     stumbles back one step, sitting down HARD on the bottom stair of
     her curved staircase.

     He doesn't know what to do.  She digs her elbows into her lap, and
     begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands.  Her
     face is more terrible than tears.  It is frightened.  She murmurs
     to herself, so that we can barely hear...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I told him this could happen.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on Hooks, nodding.  As if, slowly, digesting something in his
     mind.

                               HOOKS
                     So, no...immediate suspicion,
                     no...general talk of enmity
                     between the two.

                               MORAN
                     These are fishermen, Alvin.  They
                     don't talk at all to each other
                     and less to me.  Specially gossip.

     EXT. DOCKS - DAY

     Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf.  Purpose in his stride...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     A gill-netter works through black
                     nights with only himself to talk
                     to.  And learns to be silent.
                     They were lonely men and products
                     of geography.

     Up ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock.  Moran stands
     chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...men who, on occasion, realized
                     that they wished to speak, but
                     couldn't.

     As he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting.  Not happy to see him.
     Of course, neither is anyone else.

                               MORAN
                     Figure you'da heard by now.

     Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness.  WILLIAM GJOVAAG, a
     sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp
     cigar butt.

                               GJOVAAG
                     You go fishing, it happens.

                               ISHMAEL (to Moran)
                     You see Susan Marie?

                               MORAN
                     I did.  Boy.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Three kids.  What's she going to do?

                               GJOVAAG (disgusted)
                     Well, what can she do?  Jesus Christ.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Excuse me, Gjovaag.

                               GJOVAAG
                     I don't need to excuse nothin'.
                     Fuck you anyhow, Chambers.

     Everybody laughs.  It is all good-natured, sort of.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Like the Sheriff, I did not work
                     the sea, and could never merit trust.
                     Or respect.

                               MARTY JOHANSSON
                     Sheriff's been askin' which boats
                     followed Carl out last night...

                               MORAN (quickly)
                     Only to see if somebody talked to
                     him out th...

                               ISHMAEL
                     So who talked to him?  Out there.

     Staring.  At each other.  Eye contact holds during...

                               JAN SORENSEN (heavy Danish)
                     So far, we figured the guys who went
                     to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry,
                     Hardwell, Moulton, Miyamoto...

                               GJOVAAG (spits)
                     Japs.

                               MORAN
                     All right, look, if you see these
                     boys...

                               GJOVAAG
                     Never saw you so hard-ass, Art.
                     Ain't this just an accident?

     Moran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmael's.  Which are right there,
     waiting.  Moran looks away.

                               MORAN
                     Course it is, but a man's dead,
                     William.  I got to write my report.

     ANGLE...Ishmael and Moran, walking alone back up the wharf.  The
     Sheriff is worried.  Finally...

                               MORAN
                     I'm not gonna see some article
                     about an investigation, am I?

                               ISHMAEL (quietly)
                     You want me to lie?

                               MORAN
                     No, I wanna be off the damn record,
                     that's what I want.

     No answer.  They keep walking.

                               MORAN
                     I mean, if there is a killer, why
                     would you want him all alerted?

     Silence.  Silence.  And slowly...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Let's say...someday I need some
                     cooperation from you on this thing.
                     Do I get it?

     And looks over.  Like the guy holding all the aces.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Moran fidgets on the stand.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     No sign of a struggle, you say.

     SEE him now.  NELS GUDMUNDSSON, attorney for Kabuo Miyamoto, stands
     beside his impassive client.  Nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a
     little shaky.  His body is winding down.

                               MORAN
                     Well, the coffee cup was layin' right
                     in the middle of the floor, like I
                     said.  And with a fella so neat as
                     Carl, that did seem peculiar.

     And Nels begins to walk toward him.  Limping, as he comes.

                               NELS
                     As peculiar as a struggle between
                     a 235 pound man, and an assailant
                     strong enough to subdue him...that
                     leaves only a single overturned cup
                     in its wake?

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     Objection, asking the witness to
                     speculate.

                               NELS
                     My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to
                     object every time you did that?

     A real.  Friendly smile.

                               JUDGE (wearily)
                     That's quite enough horseplay,
                     Nels, why don't you act your age?

                               NELS
                     If I did that Your Honor, I'd
                     be dead.

     Some gentle laughter.  Judge Fielding doesn't even bother to look
     annoyed.

                               JUDGE
                     Any more homely loveable tricks,
                     and you'll be worse than that.
                     Proceed, gentlemen.

                               HOOKS
                     There's an objection, Your H...

                               JUDGE
                     And it's overruled, answer the
                     question.  If you can recall it.

                               MORAN
                     Maybe the assailant straightened
                     the cabin.  And forgot the cup.

                               NELS
                     Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.

                               MORAN
                     Maybe.

     Nels nods to himself, as if considering that.  So that the jury
     will do the same.

                               NELS
                     I think you testified all the
                     lights were on.  Cabin, mast,
                     net lights, picking lights...

                               MORAN
                     Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.

                               NELS
                     And yet you started the engine
                     right up.  With all those lights
                     drawing all night, the batteries
                     had that much charge.  Did that
                     strike you odd?

                               MORAN
                     Didn't think about it at the time.
                     So no, it didn't strike me odd.

                               NELS
                     Does it now?

                               MORAN
                     A little.  Yes.  You have to
                     wonder.

                               NELS
                     You have to wonder.

     And lets that sit.  Scratches his neck.

                               NELS
                     You found three batteries, you
                     say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well.
                     And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor.
                     Correct?

                               MORAN
                     It is.

                               NELS
                     Now I did some measuring down at
                     the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch
                     wider than a D-8.  It would be too
                     large for the deceased's well.

                               MORAN
                     He's done some on-the-spot refit-
                     ting.  You could see the side flange
                     was banged away to make room for
                     the D-6.

                               NELS
                     But he had a spare D-6, you said.
                     Right there.  Why not use that?

                               MORAN
                     It was dead.  We had it tested.
                     Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he
                     had to use it.

     Ah.

                               NELS
                     Maybe he carried a spare that
                     was too large to fit.  So he'd
                     have to bang out the flange to
                     squeeze it in?

     No answer to that.  The silence rests.

                               NELS
                     Sheriff, how many batteries and
                     what size did you find on defendant's
                     boat?

                               MORAN
                     Two D-6's.  That's the kind his
                     well was fitted for.

                               NELS
                     No spare.

                               MORAN
                     No.

                               NELS
                     So the defendant went out fishing
                     for the night with no spare battery,
                     hmmn?

                               MORAN
                     Apparently.

                               NELS
                     I'm curious.  The D-6 that was
                     refitted into the deceased's well.
                     Was it exactly the same brand and
                     model as defendant's?

     A beat.

                               MORAN
                     I believe so.

                               NELS
                     Now you've testified that the
                     deceased was a heavy man, and hard
                     to bring out of the net.

     Stops.  Thinking.

                               NELS
                     Is it possible his head struck the
                     transom, or the stern gunnel, or the
                     net roller, as you were bringing him
                     in?

                               MORAN
                     I don't think so.

                               NELS
                     You don't.  Think so.

                               MORAN
                     He was heavy, but we were real
                     careful.  But I don't remember him
                     hitting anything, anywhere.

                               NELS
                     You don't.  Remember.

     And clears his throat.

                               NELS
                     Operating this winch you'd rarely
                     operated before, doing this awkward
                     job of bringing in a drowned man of
                     235 pounds...is it possible.  Possible
                     that he struck his head after death.
                     Possible?

                               MORAN
                     Possible.  But not darn likely.

                               NELS (turns to jury)
                     No further questions.

     And limps back to the defendant's table.  Where Kabuo Miyamoto sits
     watching him.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Horace Whaley, the county coroner, folds his stork-like limbs
     uncomfortably.  Searching for the appearance of ease.

                               HOOKS
                     ...so when the sheriff returned,
                     you showed him the injury to the
                     deceased's head.

                               WHALEY
                     He said, 'Could it be somebody hit
                     him?'  And I said, 'You want to play
                     Sherlock Holmes, here?'

     Shakes his head, with a wry, disgusted smile.

                               HOOKS
                     Did you say more?

                               WHALEY
                     I said that if I was playing Sherlock
                     Holmes...I'd maybe look for a...
                     Japanese person.  With a bloody gun-
                     butt.  A right-handed fella, to be
                     precise.

                               HOOKS
                     And why.  Is that?

     Slight shrug.

                               WHALEY
                     Well, I was a doctor in the Jap
                     theater, in the war.  I saw those
                     kendo wounds, many times.  Looked
                     exactly like this one.

                               HOOKS
                     Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?

                               WHALEY
                     Japanese stick-fighting.  They're
                     trained as kids, y'know.  To kill
                     with sticks.

     And the prosecutor's eyes drift to the defendant.  So that the
     jury's will do the same.  HOLD on Kabuo's regal bearing.  His
     neutral mask.

                     No further questions.

     EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAWN

     Mist of early light.  Two dark figures, little more than
     silhouettes, measuring each other with their lethal bokken staffs.
     We may think of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, for one is a full-
     grown man.  The other, eight years old.  Dialogue plays in
     subtitled JAPANESE...

                               ZENHICHI
                     Hips, stomach, cut.  Stomach muscles
                     tighten as stroke advances...

     And STRIKES a fearsome blow, which the child REPELS with startling
     proficiency.  We can see ZENHICHI's stony face, now.  If he is
     impressed by his son, he does not show it.

                               ZENHICHI

     CRASH!  The father has sent a blow in mid-word, FLINGING the child
     like a doll.  The boy BOUNCES up, snatching his bokken into ready

     WHAP!  The child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his
     father's HEAD.  It has been blocked.  The staffs rest against each
     other, just above Zenhichi's ear.  There is no anger in either
     warrior.  That we can see.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Elbow soft.  A little better.

     LATER...father and son sit on the ground, eating a small meal.
     The sun has risen, angling light across the undulating fields.
     They are alone in beauty.  A long silence.  Dialogue in subtitled

                     You can be good with the bokken.
                     If you begin to concentrate.

     Eyes on his food.  As if alone, as if speaking to himself.  The boy
     darting glances, unseen, at his father's profile.

                               ZENHICHI
                     You must choose now, Kabuo.  At eight
                     years.  If you want this.

                               KABUO (boldly)
                     I want it.

     The father keeps eating.  Never turns.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Then speak quietly.  So you may be
                     heard.

     INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

     Whaley stares down the end of his needle-nose.  The air of disdain
     of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So this...foam you found in the
                     lungs.  How does it get there?

                               WHALEY
                     As I testified.  It occurs when
                     water, mucus and air are mixed by
                     respiration.  I believe I said that.

                               NELS (slightly confused)
                     But a drowned person can't breathe.

                               WHALEY
                     Of course not.  The foam means
                     that he went in breathing.

     Ah.

                               WHALEY
                     That's why the autopsy report
                     identifies drowning as the cause
                     of death.

                               NELS
                     Meaning that he wasn't murdered
                     first, say on the deck of the boat,
                     and then thrown overboard.

                               WHALEY
                     Well...

                               NELS
                     Your report says death by drowning,
                     which means he went into the water
                     alive and breathing.  And the report
                     is accurate...?

                               WHALEY (bristles)
                     Of course it's accurate, but...

                               NELS
                     Of course, it is.  Now as to the
                     head injury.  You say made by an
                     object narrow and flat.  That is
                     your inference, correct?

                               WHALEY (really pissed)
                     It's my job to infer, that's what
                     coroners do.  You get hit with a
                     crowbar, or a ball-peen hammer, or
                     fall off a motorcycle, the injuries
                     look different, that's my area of
                     expertise.

     Nels nods.  He can be quiet now.  The witness distracted from
     volunteering the opinions Nels did not wish for.

                               NELS
                     In your motorcycle example.  Those
                     injuries are produced by the head
                     being propelled against an object.
                     Rather than the reverse, yes?

                               WHALEY
                     Obviously.

                               NELS
                     Can you tell whether an object moved
                     against the head, or the other way
                     around?  Or would both look the same.

                               WHALEY
                     The same.

                               NELS
                     So if his head struck something
                     narrow and flat, the gunnel of a
                     boat, a net roller, a fairlead,
                     could that have...

                               WHALEY
                     If the head was moving fast enough,
                     but I don't see how it could be.

                               NELS
                     Is it possible?

                     Is it fair to say that you do not
                     know for certain which it was.

                               WHALEY
                     I already said that, b...

                               NELS
                     And that you can't say for
                     certain whether the head injury was
                     sustained before or after death?

     Whaley thinks.

                               WHALEY
                     For certain, no.

                               NELS
                     But you are certain that he died
                     by drowning.

                               WHALEY
                     For the third time, yes.

     Nels nods.  Whaley is beyond frustrated.

                               WHALEY
                     Can I say something, here?

                               NELS
                     Yes, you can tell me about the
                     minor cut you found on the deceased's
                     right hand.  The report says 'recent
                     origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24
                     hours before death?

                               WHALEY
                     Absolutely not.  Probably one or two
                     hours.  Four at the most.

     A pause.

                               NELS

                               WHALEY
                     Yes, I'm sure.

     Nels nods.  Silence.

                               NELS
                     Thank you, Horace.  No more
                     questions.

     Horace wants to say more.  Doesn't immediately move.

                               JUDGE
                     We'll take our luncheon recess.
                     Reconvene at...2 o'clock sharp.

     The gavel CRACKS onto the block.  Judge Fielding stands to leave,
     and the BAILIFF begins to usher the jury from its box.  Abel
     Martinson, the deputy, stands near as Kabuo rises.  As he puts his
     hand gently on Kabuo's arm, the defendant turns smoothly...

     ...to face a woman.  Standing at the rail.  And beneath the
     courtroom buzz...

                               KABUO
                     How are the kids?

     The voice so colloquially American, we are taken back.  Having
     envisioned Kabuo as a silent Samurai.

                               HATSUE
                     They need their father.

     The look holds.  Abel increasingly uneasy.

                               KABUO
                     Well.  Just a few more days.

                               ABEL (coughs)
                     Look, Art's gonna want me t...

                               KABUO (ignoring him)
                     You look beautiful.

     Abel grasps his arm.

                               HATSUE
                     I look terrible.  Don't sit so
                     straight like Tojo's soldier.  The
                     jury will be afraid of you.

     He thinks about that.  Abel tugs him.

                               KABUO
                     Okay, I'll hide under the table
                     from now on.  That make you happy?

     And for the first time.  He smiles.  And seems suddenly very
     American indeed.  She stares back, her heart in her eyes.  Abel
     tugs harder, but he can't budge the defendant.

                               KABUO
                     I'm not going until you smile.

     But she doesn't.  So his fades.  One last look.  And he lets Abel
     lead him away.

     HOLD on her.  Watching him go.

     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT

     Stars above a desert.  Wind gusts.  PAN barbed wire, rows of dark
     barracks blurred by swirling dust, to...

     ...a fragile tar paper structure, its 'walls' rippling pre-
     cariously.  And inside, to see that it is...

     INT. BUDDHIST CHAPEL - NIGHT

     ...a makeshift sanctuary.  Candles, offerings of fruit.  A young
     COUPLE together before a Buddhist PRIEST.  Kabuo and Hatsue.
     Becoming one.

     INT. BARRACKS - LATER

     A cramped, ramshackle room.  Dust blowing through gaps in the
     flimsy beams.  Kerosene light.  FUJIKO IMADA hangs the last of
     the woolen army blankets to divide the room in half, as her four
     youngest DAUGHTERS watch.  We PUSH THROUGH the blankets to the
     other side, to see...

     ...the newlyweds.  Standing at a window in their wedding clothes.
     Kissing.  Slow and full.  Until she whispers into his ear...

                               HATSUE
                     They'll hear everything.

     And her young husband turns.  Speaks to the curtain.

                               KABUO (loud)
                     There must be something good on
                     the radio!

     She giggles.  His hands trace her body.

                               KABUO (louder)
                     Wouldn't some music be nice?

     And in a moment.  The MUSIC begins.  Glenn Miller.  A song that
     sent our boys off to war.  And our young American prisoners...

     ...begin to undress each other.  Her slender fingers find the
     buttons of his shirt, deftly undoing it, as he kisses her face.
     He unclasps her dress.  And as it falls from her shoulders, falls
     to the floor, we PUSH INTO her eyes, and...

     INTERCUT her MEMORY of...

     ...a beach.  Two 10-year-old CHILDREN floating on the water.
     Clinging to a wooden box, with a glass bottom for fish-watching.
     The girl is Asian.  The boy is not.

                               HATSUE
                     Ishmael.  See the yellow one?

     And the boy wriggles around, leans over the box, as if seeking a
     better view.  And KISSES the girl.  Full on her startled mouth.

     BACK TO...the newlyweds.  On their cot now.  Close together.  Naked
     and hungry for each other.

                               KABUO (loud)
                     Can the music be louder, please?
                     We can't hear so good in here!

     The girl laughs soundlessly.  And as the music BLARES, he has slid
     his body above hers.  A whisper...

                               KABUO
                     Have you ever done this?

     A whisper back, sure and strong...

                               HATSUE
                     Never.  You're my only.

     And as he enters her.  As she holds him close with all her
     strength.  Her lips breathe into his ear...

                               HATSUE
                     ...so right.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hatsue watching her husband disappear through a door.  RACK FOCUS
     to see across the way.  A man stares at her.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Course, we grew up together.

     INT. IMADA PARLOR - DAY

     Hatsue at 12, sits with an OLD WOMAN who guides her silently,
     exquisitely, through the ritual of the tea ceremony.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Her mom had this Mrs. Shigemura
                     come on Wednesdays.  Teach her
                     how to be Japanese.

     The woman turns the cup in her hands.  One-quarter turn.  Bows
     slightly, as she presents the tea.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Dances, calligraphy.  Doing her hair.
                     How to sit without moving...

     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY

     Hatsue and Ishmael, both 12, are sprawled on the ground, sheltered
     in the hollowed-out base of a cedar tree.  They watch the rain as
     it pummels the woods around them.  She is speaking, carefully,
     thoughtfully.  He listens with complete attention.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     She would tell me stories of
                     this woman and her lessons.  As
                     if complaining, or at least ex-
                     plaining her world...

     He shifts his position, his body brushing against hers, which makes
     him reflexively pull away.  She seems not to notice.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     But I always fantasized.  The
                     lessons were for me.

     INT. BEDROOM - DAY

     Hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror.  Mrs. Shigemura watching
     analytically, as Hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     No.  You must never look at a man
                     directly.  This is part of grace.

     The girl smiles a small sour smile.  Speaks quietly...

                               HATSUE
                     I don't think the boys on this
                     island.  Are impressed.  By grace.

     The old woman studies her without irritation.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue.

     Apparently, the girl has heard this before.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     This is why they fear death.  Because
                     life here is separate from Being.

     The girl takes a long pin.  Begins carefully to fasten her hair.
     Breaking eye contact with the mirror.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     It is why they have no soul.

     Is the girl even listening?  The old woman's voice never rises.
     Remains patient.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     Life embraces death, includes it.
                     This truth brings tranquility.  You
                     must see yourself...

                               HATSUE
                     ...as a leaf.  On a great tree.

     No irony in the girl's voice.  No disrespect.  The old woman reads
     the young face in the mirror.

                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
                     The pin.  Could be better placed.

     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - DAY

     CLOSE on 12-year-old Ishmael.  Neutral eyes.  Eating an apple.  A
     horrific CLANGING surrounds us.  The clash of metal on metal.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     My lessons came from my father.  They
                     were different.  Or seemed so, at the
                     time.

     See ARTHUR CHAMBERS now, at the printing press, an enormous lime
     green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast-
     iron housing.  The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient
     locomotive.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He operated the Review alone, with
                     an integrity and passion for principle
                     that made him a figure of respect.  If
                     slightly larger than life.

     Arthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun-metal rimmed
     spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves.  He wears the soft,
     perpetual smile of an Oxford Don, as he gracefully ducks in and
     out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He never spoke of wanting me to
                     succeed him.  And, in truth, it was
                     the last job on earth I thought I'd
                     ever want.

     The boy rises now.  Sets his apple carefully aside.  And under his
     father's supervision, takes his place operating the press.  His
     arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     When I was five, he casually mentioned
                     that if his sleeve got caught in the
                     press, he'd be instantly popped open
                     like a child's balloon, and splattered
                     across the walls.

     Watch Ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with
     complete concentration.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Even his bones would disappear, to
                     be discovered later on the floor,
                     as strips of white confetti.

     Arthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence.  Picks
     up the boy's apple.  A crisp BITE.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Which, of course, made me certain that
                     life would have no meaning until I
                     could run that teakettle.

     EXT. MAIN STREET, AMITY HARBOR - SUNSET

     Arthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of
     what seems a festive carnival.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He was, for better or worse, the
                     only God in my life.  I guess it's
                     our nature to resent those we know
                     we can never measure up to...

     They are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games.
     A genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races
     heedlessly mingling.  A community.  Arthur unselfconsciously slips
     his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...which keeps us from accepting
                     the warmth.  The way we should.

     Up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse.
     Something's up.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Every summer, after harvest, the
                     Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor-
                     ite story to cover.  Good news was
                     his preference.  Making him an oddity
                     among journalists.

     As we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the
     courthouse steps.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Highlight was crowning the Strawberry
                     Princess.  Always a Japanese girl,
                     sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
                     to the concept of racial harmony.

     We are there now.  Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael
     would use years later.  Focusing up at the MAYOR, as he places the
     crown on the radiant young girl...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Senior Year.  It was Hatsue.

     And as the applause ripples through the crowd.  As the Strawberry
     Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on...

     ...Ishmael.  She drops him a wink.  And a special wave.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     She winked at me.  In public.
                     Which was unusual.

     EXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY

     Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach.  Digging for clams in the mud.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I had kissed her once, when we
                     were ten.  Looking at fish through
                     a glass-bottomed box.  It was just
                     an impulse, and no big deal.

     Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to
     reach down.  We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in
     geoduck clam.

                               HATSUE
                     He's still got a good grip.  We
                     need to dig more.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     At school, she kept mostly to the
                     Japanese kids, and sort of ignored
                     me.  As if all of our times alone
                     together...in the hollow cedar,
                     everywhere...were a secret.

     They are digging now, together.  Carefully.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I told myself that was good.  That
                     it made our friendship special.  And
                     didn't mean she was ashamed of it.
                     Necessarily.

                               HATSUE
                     Easy.  Slow is best.

     Gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I thought about her.  Sometimes,
                     all the time.  I knew I was unhappy.
                     But I knew if I told her...

     She lifts it clear.  And as she admires its size and roughness with
     her fingertips.  As she washes it in the shallows.  He watches her
     movements.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It might be a mistake.  I could
                     never correct.

                               ISHMAEL (quietly)
                     I like you.

     The words make her turn.  Not startled, exactly.  Alerted.  But
     neutral, without affect.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Do you know what I mean, Hatsue?
                     I've always liked you.

     There is no answer.  He leans slightly closer, and she looks
     down.  This is the moment.  Afraid and driven, he moves slowly
     to her face.  And puts his mouth against hers.  She lets him and,
     encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue...

     ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to
     support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a
     long moment, before...

     ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the
     beach like a deer.  He stands slowly.  To watch her go.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I knew in my heart that we would
                     love each other forever.

     His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness.
     Contemplating this truth.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     The way she kissed me.  She knew
                     it, too.

     EXT. IMADA FARM - DUSK

     Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm, in near-darkness.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     She avoided me for a week.

     Across the distance, the screen door opens, light slips across the
     porch.  Hatsue appears with a wicker basket, to take the laundry
     from the line.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     So this way, I could see her
                     without...bothering anyone.

     He watches, rapt, as she unpins and folds the clothes, clenching
     the clothespins in her teeth.  Then reeling the line again, elegant
     hand over elegant hand...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I was certain everything would
                     work out.

     She corrals the long sweep of her hair, knotting it deftly, before
     heading inside.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     And frightened.

     EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAY

     Children working fields in sunlight.  Kneeling in the rows.  Hatsue
     with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly
     sheened with sweat.  She works with efficiency and grace, filling
     her flat.

     Three rows away.  Ishmael watches.  The fear not far beneath the
     surface of his quiet, dark features.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     By two weeks, I knew I had made
                     the defining mistake of my life.

     Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks
     DOWN rapidly at his work.  Cheeks burning, certain she is watching.
     Which she is not.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I'd ruined everything.

     LATER...end of day.  The young pickers turning in their flats as a
     gentle rain begins.  Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her
     pocket, and...

     ...runs lightly off, into the growing rain.  Ishmael sees.
     Stricken to his soul with longing.  And indecision.

     EXT. CEDAR GROVE - DAY

     Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of
     the hollow cedar.  The rain is driving now, and she glances up.
     At something we don't see.  And watches it.  Finally...

                               HATSUE
                     You followed me, huh?

     PULL BACK to see him.  Rain pelting off his poor soaked form.  She
     is waiting for an answer.  So...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Sorry.  It sort of...happened, I
                     just...I followed you.  I'm sorry.

     She pulls her hair behind her ears.  A movement which stretches her
     body.

                               HATSUE
                     I'm all wet.

     She starts refastening her hair now, looking away.  He comes
     inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can.  Which is
     close.  He watches her, watches her, and...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry I kissed you on
                     the beach.

     No reaction.  As if she hasn't heard.  Now his heart is beating
     straight through his chest.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Let's just forget about it.
                     Forget it happened.

     She picks up her damp straw hat.  And, eyes down, tracing a finger
     around its brim...

                               HATSUE
                     Don't be sorry.  I'm not sorry
                     about it.

     His heart bursts within him.  And he struggles to keep it from his
     face.  Even though she isn't watching.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Me neither.

     She turns her face to him, and offers a small smile.  It is
     genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy.  She lies back on
     the ground.  Her eyes so unafraid and direct.

                               HATSUE
                     Do you think this is wrong?

     He swallows.  Staring at her lying there so comfortably.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     The best part was that there was a
                     'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Your friends would.  Your dad would
                     kill me with a machete.

                               HATSUE
                     We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael.
                     He'll slice you up with a ceremonial
                     sword.

     Ah.  Better.  They are both grinning now.

                               HATSUE
                     My mom.  Would be the problem.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Why?  We're only talking.

     Her eyes flicker.  The synapse that a woman can offer a man.

                               HATSUE (softly)
                     Sure.

     And touches his hand.  With her fingertips.  The barest whisper...

                               HATSUE
                     I can't hear you.

     Thus invited, he leans down over Hatsue.  Kisses her mouth with all
     the tenderness in him.  This time, her eyes close gently.  And her
     body arches slightly, into his.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     We kissed for half an hour, that
                     first time.  And I knew there would
                     never be another day like it.

     Rain POUNDING now.  A curtain of water, sealing them from the
     world.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     No matter how long I lived.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on Ishmael, once more in the row of reporters.  Absently
     kneading the stump of his amputated arm.  The way some men drum
     their fingers.

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     ...you were acquainted with the
                     defendant and his family.

     ETTA HEINE is a linebacker in a dress.  Stout and German and wary.
     She is 57, and pulls her hem down tight below her knees.

                               ETTA
                     Him and his folks and two brothers
                     and two sisters worked our land.
                     Lived in a picker's cabin at first.

                               HOOKS
                     So the defendant knew the deceased,
                     your son, even then.

                               ETTA
                     They fished t'gether.  Went to school.
                     Carl Junior treated him like a white
                     person.  Like any friend.

     Said not with pride, but regret.

                               HOOKS
                     But the dispute began.  With the
                     father, yes?

     INT. HEINE FARMHOUSE - DAY

     Etta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor
     window, as her husband CARL SENIOR strools the strawberry fields
     with Kabuo's father Zenhichi.  Carl is a huge rawboned man, and
     puffs a pipe as Zenhichi stops, sweeps his arms this way and that.
     Etta knows trouble when she sees it.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATER

     Etta pours her husband's coffee.  It is very quiet.

                               ETTA
                     Don't sell, Carl.  You'll regret it.

                               CARL SR.
                     Only seven acres, and the worst
                     seven, at that.  They're decent
                     folks.  They got five hunnerd to
                     put down now.

                               ETTA
                     Don't go wavin' new church clothes
                     at me.  We're not such paupers as
                     sell to Japs, are we?  For what, a
                     pouch of fancy pipe tobacco?

     She walks about the kitchen with her arms folded.  Too upset to
     be still.

                               CARL SR.
                     They work hard, live clean, don't
                     spend nothin'.  Even kind to the
                     Indjuns.  People is people, comes
                     down to it.

     Etta turns sharply.  Glares at the big man.  He just blinks
     blandly, puffs his pipe.  She can see this ship has sailed.

                               ETTA
                     You wear the pants, doncha?  Go
                     ahead, sell our land to a Jap and
                     see what comes of it.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks pacing, slow and calm.  This part needs to be clear.

                               HOOKS
                     But back in '34, Japanese-born
                     could not own land.  So...?

                               ETTA
                     Carl held it for 'em.  Called it
                     a lease.  They make payments every
                     June and December...

                               HOOKS
                     Why?  If they could never take title.

                               ETTA
                     Their kids was born here.  So when
                     the oldest, that one there, was
                     twenty...last payment gets made,
                     and he could own it.

     She folds her hands.  Looks Kabuo square in the eye.

                               ETTA
                     But they missed their last two
                     payments.  So that was that.

     INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

     Carl Sr. and Zenhichi sit at the table.  There is coffee.  But it
     is untouched.  Etta watches by the stove.

                               ETTA (V.O.)
                     March 1942, orders came down.  Japs
                     had eight days before the Army was
                     gonna cart 'em off.

     Carl lights his pipe.  Compassion in his broad weathered face.

                               CARL SR. (softly)
                     Eight days.  It ain't right.

                               ZENHICHI
                     We must leave everything.  If you
                     like, you can work our fields, sell
                     berries, keep the money.  Otherwise,
                     they just rot.

                               ETTA (V.O.)
                     Japs are shrewd.  Offer berries he
                     can't use.  Soften us up about those
                     two payments still to come.

     And sure enough, Zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills.  Puts
     them on the table.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Today, I have $120 toward next paym...

                               CARL SR.
                     Absolutely not, Zenhichi.  I'm not
                     gonna take your savings at a time
                     like this.

     The small man spreads the bills out.  On the table.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Please, you take.  Then, I send more
                     from where I'm going.  If not enough,
                     you still have seven acres strawber...

                               ETTA
                     Thought you was givin' us those.

     And everything.  Stops.

                               ETTA
                     Didn't you come in here givin' them
                     away?  Now you want $130, after our
                     labor and fertilizer.  Is that what
                     you come here hopin' on?

     Zenhichi keeps his anger within.  His face is stone.

                               ETTA (V.O.)
                     I spit on him, and he's pretending
                     it didn't happen that way.  How could
                     anyone trust people like that?

                               ETTA
                     You want more coffee?

                               ZENHICHI
                     No, thank you.  Take money, please.

     But Carl is staring at his wife.  She stares right back.  Carl
     turns, slides the money toward Zenhichi.

                               CARL SR.
                     Etta's been rude to you, and I
                     apologize for that.  You keep this
                     money, and those payments will work
                     out fine.  Somewhere down the road.

     INT. PARLOR - TWILIGHT

     Silence.  Palpable.  Two figures sit at opposite ends of this
     darkening room, each under a lamp.  Carl Sr. is reading the paper.
     His face is stone.  Etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills
     and ledgers.  Her face is angry.

     A screen door opens.  Slams shut.  Big footfalls coming.  No one
     looks up.

                               CARL JR.
                     Look at this!

     He stands in the doorway.  A bamboo fishing road in his giant hand.

                               CARL JR.
                     Kabuo loaned it to me.  Til he
                     gets back.

     And his parents stare back him.

                               CARL JR.
                     It's great for sea-run cutthroat.
                     The ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped.

                               ETTA
                     Take that back.  And do it now.

     The big young face is stunned, hurt.

                               CARL JR.
                     I told Kabuo I'd take ca...

                               ETTA
                     Those Japs owe us.  I don't want
                     nothin' confusing that.

     The boy looks to his father.  Who says nothing.

                               ETTA
                     I said now, boy.  Supper's in
                     forty minutes.

     Crestfallen, defeated, the boy backs away.  Hear his footfalls.
     The screen door SLAM hard.

     And Carl Sr. looks at his wife.  No sound, until...

                               CARL SR.
                     We ain't right together.

     The words are flat and straight.  Etta stoic.

                               CARL SR.
                     You and me.  We just ain't right.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks settles back.  His butt on the edge of the prosecutor's
     table.  The soul of patience and clarity.

                               HOOKS
                     You said neither of the last two
                     payments were made.  But your husband
                     told defendant's father that he could
                     pay them...what, 'down the road'.

     And straight back...

                               ETTA
                     Road ended October 1944, when my
                     husband passed away.

     She nods.  That's all there was to it.

                               ETTA
                     I sold all the land to our
                     neighbor, Ole Jurgensen.  Got
                     a fair price, this time.  And...

     Straightens her spine.  To deliver the clincher...

                               ETTA
                     Sent all their equity back to those
                     Japs down in California.  Which I
                     didn't have to do.  Specially since
                     my boy was out in the Pacific, gettin'
                     shot at by Japs at the time.

     Hooks pauses.  As if drinking this in.

                               HOOKS
                     Now defendant's father had also
                     died by that point.  Where was
                     the defendant?  When you sent
                     his family their equity.

                               ETTA
                     In the war.  Europe, I believe.
                     They could hardly send him to the
                     Pacific, could they?

     Kabuo watching the woman.  Eyes as hard as her own.

                               HOOKS
                     And when he came home.  Did he
                     write you about this?  Or phone,
                     perhaps.

                               ETTA
                     Just showed up at my door, big as
                     life and twice as mean.  Wanted to
                     talk to my son.

     INT. ETTA'S APARTMENT, AMITY HARBOR - DAY

     Kabuo stands at the open door.  No one is inviting him inside.

                               ETTA
                     He's over the ocean, fighting the
                     Japs.  They're just about licked.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Just about.

     And there it sits.

                               ETTA
                     When Mr. Heine passed away, I
                     couldn't farm the place myself,
                     could I?  You're gonna have to talk
                     to Ole abou...

                               KABUO
                     I just did.  He didn't know we were
                     one payment away.  You didn't tell
                     him Mr. Heine promised my fath...

                               ETTA
                     I was s'posed to tell him there's
                     some illegal contract muddling things
                     up?  You folks didn't make your pay-
                     ments.  In America, bank comes in and
                     repossesses your land.  I didn't do
                     anything wrong.

     Kabuo stands.  Calm, unblinking.

                               KABUO
                     Nothing illegal.  Wrong is a
                     different mat...

                               ETTA
                     Get out of here.

                               KABUO
                     You sold our land out from under
                     us, Mrs. Heine.  You took advantage
                     of the fact that we were gone.  You...

     SLAMM.  The door has closed in his face.  And Kabuo stands there.
     As if deciding.

     Whether to break it down.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks standing at the jury box now.  Looking at them, as he asks...

                               HOOKS
                     What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?

                               ETTA
                     Well.  Every time I see him in
                     town or somewhere, he's starin'
                     at me with these narrow eyes.
                     Givin' me his mean face.

                               HOOKS
                     When your son came back from the
                     war, what did he say about all this?

                               ETTA
                     That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto.
                     Watch out for him.

                               HOOKS

                               HOOKS
                     All right.  What did your son say
                     to that effect?

     She looks up.  As if trying to recall.

                               ETTA
                     He said he wished Kabuo would forget
                     about his seven acres, and stop
                     lookin' at us cross-eyed.

     Hooks stares at the jury.  Holds the moment.

                               HOOKS
                     Your witness.

     And goes slowly back to his seat.  Nels waits until his opponent is
     seated.  Then, rises.

                               NELS
                     Just three questions.  The Miyamoto
                     family bought your seven acres for
                     $4500?

                               ETTA
                     Tried to.  Defaulted on their
                     payments.

                               NELS
                     Second question.  What did Ole
                     Jurgensen pay you per acre?

                               ETTA
                     A thousand.

                               NELS
                     So that makes what would have been
                     $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If
                     you sent the equity back, you had
                     a profit of $2500.

                               ETTA
                     Is that your third question?

                               NELS
                     It is.

                               ETTA
                     You done your math right.

     The old man wears a thin, cold smile.

                               NELS
                     You, too.  No further questions.

     HOLD on Kabuo.  As he watches Etta rise heavily from the box.

     EXT. DEEP FOREST - FIRST LIGHT

     Mist of moments before dawn.  As tendrils part, there is enough
     light to see...

     ...eyes.  They are Asian.  They are razor-keen.  PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     ...Kabuo alone in G.I. gear and helmet.  Rifle up high, sweat
     on his face, moving soundlessly, turning in a circle as he goes,
     until...

     ...he stops.  A heartbeat of silence.  Then...

     ...the BLAST of automatic tracer TEARS through trees, as he WHIRLS
     and RETURNS FIRE in a single motion, until...

     Silence.

     His heart is pounding.  He waits.  Waits.  Weapon at the ready, he
     pushes THROUGH the dense foliage to see...

     ...the 15-year-old German SOLDIER, splayed on the forest floor, his
     chest torn and bloodied.  Kabuo's gaze LOCKS with the boy's.  The
     young soldier's empty left hand reaches out in a a plea, and as
     Kabuo steps forward, the boy's right hand comes suddenly...

     ...INTO view, metal GLINTING in motion, as Kabuo...

     ...BLOWS the boy AWAY with staccato rifle BURSTS that JUMP the
     already-lifeless body like an electric jolt.  And falling from the
     kid's hand, not a pistol, but...

     ...ID TAGS.

     No expression on Kabuo's face.  None at all.  He moves on.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     OLE JURGENSEN wobbles slightly in the witness box, hands resting on
     the cane planted unsteadily between his frail legs.  His eyes leak

                     But Carl was a fisherman.  And

                     Come November, he'll sell his boat,
                     and take over the farm.

     Kabuo is thunderstruck.

                               KABUO
                     But your sign...

                               OLE
                     We din't have no time to take it down.
                     He just come ten o'clock.

     Kabuo nods.  His voice is soft, but his eyes are steel.

                               KABUO
                     It's my fault.  I should have come
                     earlier.

     He looks so odd, perhaps he's ill.  Liesel looks concerned.

                               OLE
                     If you want t'buy them seven
                     acres.  Carl Heine's the only
                     fella can sell 'em.

     INT. COURTROOM - EVENING

     The witness box is empty.  The snow outside the windows is falling
     in darkness.  And Judge Lew Fielding is leaning his frame toward
     the jurors...

                               JUDGE
                     I apologize for keeping you folks
                     from your families in a storm like
                     this.  I do hope you'll be reasonably
                     comfortable in the hotel tonight.  And
                     one more thing...

     He smiles softly.

                               JUDGE
                     This Court takes judicial notice of
                     the fact that tomorrow is the 13th
                     anniversary of the attack on Pearl
                     Harbor.

     Slight pause.  To make sure they are listening.

                               JUDGE
                     Which has no relationship to this
                     trial.  Which is why I mention it.

     Gavel CRACKS down.

                               JUDGE
                     10 o'clock tomorrow, folks.  Stay
                     warm.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

     Hatsue walks briskly down the crowded hallway, her eyes searching
     the benches lining the corridor ahead.  Her view obscured by the
     crowd hurrying to fight the storm.  Suddenly...

     ...she stops.  Because there.  On a bench.  Sits Ishmael.  Next to
     him, a round Japanese-American baby boy of 11 months.  Before him,
     squat the boy's sisters, eight and four.  All are watching
     Ishmael...

     ...manipulating a COIN.  It rolls across his knuckles and back
     again, with amazing dexterity.  Then, he snatches it into his palm.
     Holds up his fist.  All little eyes are glued.  The fist...

     ...opens.  It is EMPTY.  There are GASPS.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Know where it is?

     They don't.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's in my other hand.

     The four-year-old LAUGHS.  Her big sister socks her.  And Mom steps
     in.  The man looks up, with the sweetest smile.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Your mother went to the bathroom.
                     She said I could show them a trick.

                               FOUR-YEAR-OLD
                     HE DOESN'T HAVE A OTHER HAND!

     Hatsue is not smiling.  Nor is she angry.  Even awkward comes to
     her in a graceful way.  She scoops up her son.

                               HATSUE
                     Thank you for your help.
                           (to the girls)
                     Let's go find obaasan.

     And without even glancing at him, she heads off at a brisk pace.
     The girls following.  The four-year-old turning back to wave once.

     And then they are gone.

     INT. JAIL - NIGHT

     Kabuo stands outside the open steel door of his tiny cell, as Abel
     Martinson clumsily unfastens the manacles.  A cot, a toilet without
     a seat, a bare bulb hanging from a wire.  No windows to the outside
     world.  Only the small barred one in the cell door.  As the
     manacles fall away...

     ...Abel removes two objects from his pocket.

                               ABEL
                     This is from Nels, I can't see the
                     harm.  Don't tell Art, okay?

     Hands him two CANDY BARS.  A Snickers.  And a Baby Ruth.  Kabuo
     looks at them...

     In spite of himself.  Kabuo smiles.  Remembering...

     INT. JAIL - DAY

     Kabuo sits in jailhouse overalls on the edge of his cot.  Motion-
     less.  On a private journey of the mind.  The door CLANGS open...

                               MORAN
                     This here is Nels Gudmundsson,
                     he's your attorney.

     Kabuo looks over.  That flat, unsmiling gaze.  The old man has a
     folded chessboard and a Havana cigar box under his arm.  Their eyes
     lock, as if the Sheriff weren't even here.  And Moran leaves,
     closing the door with respectful quiet.

     Nels doesn't smile, doesn't speak.  Opens the chessboard on the
     cot.  Opens the cigar box filled with chess pieces, two cigars,
     a Snickers and a Baby Ruth.  He puts the candy bars by Kabuo's
     pillow, a silent gift.  Begins to set up the chessboard.

                               KABUO
                     What makes you think I play?

                               NELS
                     Your daddy played.  I asked, down
                     at the Japanese Community Center.
                     You smoke cigars?

     And offers one up, rough and black.

                               KABUO
                     I'm not sure.  I better check
                     down at the Center.

     Kabuo smiles only with his eyes.  Nels nods, maybe you better.
     Lights his own cigar.  Puts the matches and the other cigar at
     Kabuo's side.

                               NELS
                     White or black?

                               KABUO
                     You mean, do I like to take the
                     offensive?  Or hang back and wait.

     That seems answer enough for Nels.  He turns the board around to
     where he has white, and makes the first move.

                               NELS
                     Nice.  When two fellas understand
                     each other.

     Kabuo picks up the cigar.  STRIKES a match.

     ...........................................................
     white.  Kabuo moves a black bishop.  Nels' eyes shoot around the
     table.  He reaches and KNOCKS OVER Kabuo's black king.  Kabuo
     blinks, studies the board silently.  Then smiles.

     He unwraps the Snickers bar.  Breaks it in half.  Hands one piece
     across to his lawyer.

     SERIES OF ANGLES...

     RAPID CUTS, different days, Nels in different suits, chess pieces
     in different positions, each time Nels reaching to topple Kabuo's
     king.  The last time...

     Kabuo has to study the board for a beat.  Shakes his head.

                               KABUO
                     You must think I like losing.

                               NELS
                     I think you like learning.

     And leans his old bones back against the hard wall.

                               NELS
                     Me, too.  That's why I come.

     Pulls out two cigars.  Kabuo looks at them.

                               NELS
                     Bet there's a few things you
                     could teach me.  Kendo, for one.

                               KABUO
                     Sure.  I could take a fishing
                     gaff and split your head open.
                     Right above your left ear.

     No smile.  Steady gaze.

                               KABUO
                     You wouldn't even see it move.

                               NELS
                     You're wonderin'...how come I
                     never ask.  If you did it.

     Hands one cigar.  Across the chessboard.

                               NELS
                     Now, you've told me you killed
                     four men.  In Germany.  So I know
                     you are the kind of man who can
                     kill.  When there's a reason.

                               KABUO (very quiet)
                     Guess I am.

     Takes the cigar.  Rolls it between his thumb and forefinger.

                               NELS
                     You feel guilty.  That you took
                     their lives.  That's in your eyes.

     STRIKES a match.

                               NELS (softly)
                     Jury sees what I see.  More often
                     than not.

     Reaches stiffly.  Kabuo bends toward him.  Accepts the flame.
     Takes a puff.

                               NELS
                     Prosecutor thinks.  What was
                     your reason?  To kill Carl Heine.

     Kabuo says not a word.

                               NELS
                     Well, there is the land itself.
                     Raise your children where you
                     were raised.  Sleep with your
                     wife at night, 'stead of bein'
                     alone on the sea.

     Brings the match to his own cigar.  Careful.  Expert.

                               NELS
                     There's fairness and honor.  You
                     were cheated by that old bitch.
                     Boy, she is something.

                               KABUO (simply)
                     She's not alone.

     Worlds within those words.

                               NELS (a murmur)
                     None of us are.

     And in those.

                               NELS
                     And prejudice, like you say.  Your
                     people locked in a concentration
                     camp.  You go off to fight for our
                     country's freedom.  Come back to this.

     Shakes his head.

                               NELS
                     But Mr. Hooks has missed the one
                     reason.  One reason.  You coulda
                     done it.

     A flicker.  Behind the defendant's eyes.

                               NELS
                     I read you Etta Heine's deposition.
                     So I could watch your mind.  Like I
                     do when you move your rook, or when
                     I move mine.

     A smile now.  Very kind.  Very sad.

                               NELS
                     And you weren't thinking about her.
                     Or about land.  Or about you.

     No, you weren't.  And in the gentlest voice...

                               NELS
                     No, someone cheats you, you can
                     rise above that.  You're a family
                     man.  You put them ahead of you, hmmn?

     He sighs.  But...

                               NELS
                     Wasn't you she dishonored.

     And the old watering eyes are rock steady now.

                               NELS
                     Your father was a strong and
                     tireless man.  Honest to a fault.
                     Kind, and humble as well...

     There is a silence.  And then...

                               KABUO (real quiet)
                     Nice.  When two fellas.  Understand
                     each other.

     They let that sit.

                               NELS
                     Now this jury is gonna be lookin'
                     at the evidence with one eye.
                     And at you with the oth...

                               KABUO
                     Mr. Gudmundsson, we know what
                     that jury is looking at.

     He won't let hs eyes lie to this man.

                               NELS
                     Your father needs you.  To return
                     to your family.

     Silence.

                               NELS
                     So every time you think about
                     showing that jury strength.  Or
                     honor or composure.  Or dignity.

                               KABUO
                     I should show them an American?

     Nels sees the rage.  It breaks his heart.  It makes him feel old
     and helpless.

                               NELS
                     Show them an innocent man.

     What he stares at now.  Is a neutral mask.  As powerful and opaque
     as the voice is quiet.

                               KABUO
                     Shame you couldn't play chess with
                     my dad, sir.  He'd kick your ass.

     INT. ISHMAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Through glass, snow is tumbling in endless cascades, the world
     dwarfed by a descending heaven.  A sound, a strange soft CLICK.
     PAN across...

     ...the small, well-kept bachelor apartment.  Neat stacks of books
     on the floor, catching the overflow of shelves crammed full.
     Someone likes to read.  Another soft CLICK.  To...

     ...the kitchen now, along the floor.  An awkward high-top SHOE, its
     buckled straps above elastic LACES that fasten across the instep.
     The shoe steps on a crude wooden PEDAL.  And we hear another CLICK.
     PAN up along a vertical strip of mesh WIRE to...

     ...a plywood CONTRAPTION, held by a partially closed drawer.  A
     piece of spring steel holding a set of NAIL CLIPPERS.

     Ishmael inserts his pinkie carefully.  CLICK.  Finishes clipping
     the fingernails of his only hand.  And looks out.  At the magic of
     white.

     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY

     Safe within their haven, the 18-year-olds kiss and hold each other
     urgently.  Their tongues exploring each other's mouth, her legs
     open beneath her skirt, pressing her body up against him.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I gave her all of my soul to love.
                     I knew someday we would live in
                     France.  Italy.  Somewhere.  Far
                     from the things that upset her.

     ANGLE...later, they lie so quietly.  Her head nestled in the crook
     of his arm, he gently plays with her hair.  Her face so still, so
     thoughtful and grave.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     You don't have to be so tragic,
                     you know.

     Ah.  Her dark eyes flicker.

                               HATSUE (dry)
                     Kind of magical, the way you know
                     how to comfort a girl.

     She cuts the irony by sending her fingertips to stroke his.

                               HATSUE
                     I can just feel my spirits soar.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well, I don't do it for just
                     anybody.

     And kisses her head.  But her eyes still stare off into the tangle
     of her worries.  He draws a breath...

                               ISHMAEL
                     There can't be any wrong in
                     this, Ha...

                               HATSUE
                     I lie to my parents every day.
                     And every night.

     His light tone against the fear...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well.  Since I never told your
                     folks, I guess I'm lying to 'em,
                     too.  But you don't hear me
                     complaining about it.

     She winds her fingers with his.  Loyalty against her doubt.
     Very soft with...

                               HATSUE
                     I'm in awe.  Of your strength.

     INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

     Hatsue sits with the Japanese kids.  Ishmael with his friends.  The
     bus filled with stone-faced teenagers listening to the DRIVER, who
     brandishes his newspaper at the Japanese side of the bus...

                               DRIVER
                     ...not just Pearl, they're attackin'
                     all over the Pacific, the whole
                     fleet's destroyed.  The FBI's in
                     Seattle right now...

     And pauses.  His eyes moving from one Japanese face to the next.
     Are you listening?

                               DRIVER
                     ...arresting Jap traitors, the
                     spies and everything.  There'll
                     be a blackout tonight, so keep your
                     radios off.  So the Japs don't pick
                     up no signals.  You get the message?

     Stares them down.  Until, from across the bus...

                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)
                     Hey, Mr. Lamberson, over here!

     The driver's eyes snap around.  The tall boy is waiting.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I have a radio, too.  Don't you
                     want to be sure I got the message?

     Ishmael sees the anger.  He's not afraid of it.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Just checking.

     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - LATE NIGHT

     The horrid CLANGING of the great rattletrap press, Arthur Chambers
     ducking nimbly among the rollers.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It was a special edition, an extra.
                     My father wrote, 'These people are
                     our neighbors, they have sent their
                     sons to the United States Army...'

     Print flying onto paper as it rolls through the green metal
     gauntlet.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     'They are no more an enemy than
                     our fellow islanders of German or
                     Italian descent.'

     Belary-eyed Ishmael, pulling finished copies from the bin.  As
     he stacks them for delivery, he reads aloud, above the CLASH of
     metal...

                               ISHMAEL (sleepy and loud)
                     LET US SO LIVE THAT, WHEN IT IS OVER,
                     WE CAN LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE.
                     AND KNOW WE HAVE ACTED HONORABLY.

     Big yawn.  It's really late.  He turns, and sees...

     ...his father.  Staring at him.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I guess courage never inspires the
                     young.  Until the danger of it bites
                     their butt.

     EXT. WOODS - TWILIGHT

     They walk slowly up the path.  An arm around each other's waist,
     their bodies brushing as they go...

                               HATSUE
                     My father can't get our money from
                     the bank.  We have a few dol...

                               ISHMAEL
                     It'll be over soon.  I can get
                     you money.

     She stops.  By a weathered fence, covered in vines.  It's growing
     dark.

                               HATSUE
                     It's not going to get better, okay?

     She sighs.  He moves close, looks so grave.

                               HATSUE
                     They arrested Mr. Shirazaki,
                     because his farm is near a navy
                     transmitter.  And his family can't
                     leave their house.

     What can he say.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's just Pearl Harbor.  People
                     are a little crazy, right n...

                               HATSUE
                     Look at my face.  It's the face of
                     the people who did that.  My father
                     hardly speaks English.  We're in
                     bad trouble, you have to see that.

     He reaches.  Touches this face that he loves with all his heart.
     Forces up a smile.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe we can fix your eyes.

     She leans up.  CROSSES her eyes in a goofy expression.  Then kisses
     his mouth.  When she pulls back...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Don't let this hurt us, okay?
                     Whatever happens.

     And she studies this boy.  Knowing more than he can ever
     understand.  And chooses to whisper...

                               HATSUE
                     It won't.  You'll see.

     INT. IMADA FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

     Hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table, as
     snow drifts down beyond the window.  Plates and flatware.  Glasses
     and napkins.  Slowly, in silence, as if a ritual bonding mother and
     daughter.  She glances to the next room...

     ...her mother Fujiko plays with the babies.  Her father HISAO reads
     the paper.  Smoking his pipe.

     And Hatsue is motionless for a moment.  Watching him.

     INT. IMADA FARMHOUSE - DAY

     CLOSE on Hatsue at 18, staring with silent anger greater than her
     fear.

                               HISAO (O.S. shaky)
                     We are loyal.

     PULL BACK to see the room.  Hatsue and her sisters side by side,
     staring at the table.  On it rests a shotgun, four boxes of shells,
     a ceremonial sword.  An FBI AGENT, a small man in a dark suit, is
     tagging each item.  He wears a light, perpetual, insincere smile.

                               FUJIKO
                     Everyone on the island has
                     these things.

     Fujiko at her husband's side.  She is quietly indignant.  He is
     frightened.

                               AGENT (overly casual)
                     Well, they'll hold this stuff for
                     a little bit, then ship it back to
                     you.  It's nothing to worry about.

     And walks over to the tansu, a chest of drawers, and begins to
     remove items...

                               AGENT
                     You folks have been real polite,
                     and we'll be outta your hair in
                     just a second...

     ...a silk kimono with gold brocaded sash...

                               AGENT
                     That's very nice.  From the old
                     country, it appears.  Very high class.

     And lays it on another table.  Next to a bamboo flute, a stack of
     shakuhachi sheet music.

                               AGENT
                     These are real nice things.
                     They'll take special care of 'em.

     Hisao sees his wife's sudden alarm.  And, as respectfully as he can
     manage...

                               HISAO
                     The flute is precious.  The kimono,
                     the music.  Must you take th...

                               AGENT
                     ...oh yeh, any old country stuff,
                     we have to take.

     And sees on the sofa, an open album.  Strolls over.

                               FUJIKO
                     This is only my daughter's
                     scrapbook.  For her memories.

     So he picks it up.  Doesn't see Hatsue stiffen with repulsion, as
     he wanders, thumbing through it, toward the hallway...

                               AGENT (calling out)
                     Wilson?  Don't go pawing through
                     the underwear!

     And chuckles.  He knows they appreciate a joke.  It means there's
     nothing to be afraid of.  Stops turning pages now.  Looks up, his
     eyes moving until they find Hatsue.

                               AGENT
                     Strawberry Princess, huh?  You
                     musta been flattered by that.
                     Looks just like y...

     The soft slamming of a screen door.  Another AGENT, large and
     shambling in his too-small suit, is carrying a crate.  And a
     telling look.

                               AGENT #2 (quiet triumph)
                     Dynamite.  Twenty-four sticks.

     And the crate BANGS onto the table.  Just beside the kimono.  Lifts
     out two sticks and holds them high.  Proof.

                               HISAO
                     You must believe.  This for tree
                     stumps.  For clearing land.

     The small man's smile fades now.  First time.  And his eyes fix
     Hisao before he speaks.  As if reading his mind.

                               AGENT
                     Maybe.  Maybe.  But this is still
                     bad, y'see.

     Fujiko slips her hand into her husband's.  To give him strength.

                               AGENT
                     It's illegal contraband, you were
                     s'posed to turn this stuff in.
                     We, uh...

     Slight shrug.

                               AGENT
                     We gotta arrest you.  Have to
                     take you to Seattle.

     Fujiko's breath catches.  One of the daughters whimpers.  The
     silence hangs thick and frightening.  The bigger agent unhooks a
     pair of handcuffs from his belt, but...

                               AGENT
                     Naw, you don't need those.  Mister
                     Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act,
                     a real gentleman.

     The younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters.  The
     agent regrets this.

                               FUJIKO
                     Please, reconsider.  He has done
                     no bad th...

                               AGENT
                     Well, nobody knows that yet, do
                     they?  So, best for an honest man
                     to clear his name for godd and all.

     Ain't that right?

                               AGENT
                     Only a few questions in Seattle,
                     okay?  Few questions, few answers,
                     the whole thing is over.

     He puts his hand on Hisao's arm.  Not roughly, but much firmer than
     the ease of his voice...

                               AGENT
                     Simple as that.

     INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Eight pages of a letter, carefully written in Kanji characters,
     folded neatly on a table.

                               FUJIKO (O.S.)
                     Why do I read you this distres-
                     sing letter?  From your father.
                     From this hakujin...work camp, it
                     is called.  In Montana.

     PULL BACK to see mother and five daughters around the table.  Even
     the youngest girls somber, attentive.  As if they have aged these
     past few weeks.

                               FUJIKO
                     Because you need to know the
                     darkness.  In the hearts of the
                     hakuj...

                               HATSUE (blurts)
                     Not all of them.

     The silent wake of her outburst, her interruption, lingers.  Her
     mother studies her.

                               FUJIKO
                     The whites are enslaved by their egos,
                     Hatsue.  Each believes his aloneness
                     is everything.  We seek union wi...

                               HATSUE
                     ...the ones seeking union with the
                     Greater Life bombed Pearl Harbor.
                     They are not humble.  I am not part
                     of them, I'm part of here.

     Her voice so loud, so insistent.  Her sisters are afraid for her.
     To have shown such disrespect.  They look down at their hands.  Or
     away, as if not hearing.

                               FUJIKO (quietly, slowly)
                     I see this.  This lack of purity
                     is a mist around your soul.  I see
                     it every day, it haunts your face
                     in unguarded moments.

     The room is still as the grave.  The mother's eyes burn silently.

                               FUJIKO
                     I see it in your eagerness to
                     leave here.  And walk the woods.
                     In the afternoon.

     What does she know?  Hatsue's heart pounding.  And to her surprise,
     her mother's voice softens...

                               FUJIKO
                     If you lose your true self, Hatsue.
                     True self...

     The stern warning, the unrelenting judgement, has become a plea.

                               FUJIKO
                     There is no way back.

     INT. ISHMAEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Ishmael washing his supper plate.  His fork and knife.  His coffee
     mug.  His skillet.  Hard labor with one hand.  And as he works, he
     looks at...

     ...the window above his sink.  Darkness and moonlit snow.  And his
     own reflection.  CLOSE on his face in the glass, and MATCH DISSOLVE
     to...

     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - NIGHT

     ...Arthur Chambers.  Weary.  Worn behind the smile of knowing ease,
     as he sips coffee from a mug of his own.

     His boy sits across from him in the silent press room.  Feet up,
     reading their paper.  Its headline, ISLAND JAPANESE ACCEPT ARMY
     MANDATE TO MOVE.

                               ISHMAEL
                     See, you bring it on yourself.
                     23 ladies honored by the PTA, you
                     single out three names.  And they're
                     all Japanese.  That isn't journalism.

                               ARTHUR (quietly)
                     Because...?

     Ishmael has heard this gently prodding word all his life.  He
     sighs.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Because journalism.  Is just the
                     facts.

                               ARTHUR
                     Which facts?  You can't print
                     them all.  Journalism is balance.
                     Finding the facts folks need to know.

     The boy looks dryly at his father.  SLAPS the page with the back of
     his hand.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Hence.  The letters.

     Arthur closes his eyes.  Recites from memory...

                               ARTHUR
                     'Seems like you're favoring the Japs,
                     Art.  Writin' all about their
                     patriotism and loyalty with nothin'
                     'bout the treachery.'

     A smile in the voice.  A sad one.

                               ARTHUR

     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DUSK

     They lie so close.  Their bodies touching, not moving.  Their faces
     inches apart, so that every word is a murmur...

                               HATSUE
                     You're like me.  You've learned
                     to be devious.

     He's never seen her this fragile, this scared.  He knows he has to
     be strong for her.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's not devious, it's what we have
                     to do.  You're leaving tomorrow...

     He unties her hair.  So gently.  Tries to keep his smile calm,
     steady...

                               ISHMAEL
                     You write to my house, and put
                     Kenny Yamashita's name on the
                     return address.  It's no big deal.

     He brings his face to her hair.  Kisses it.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You smell like cedar.

     Her eyes are wide.  They move over his face.  A murmured...

                               HATSUE
                     So do you.  It's your smell I'll
                     miss as much as anything.

     He looks in her eyes.  And words come from his heart, before he can
     stop them...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Let's get married, okay?

     Her eyes fill with tears.  Are they from happiness?

                               ISHMAEL
                     I want to marry you.  Is that okay?

     Her face so still.  One tear falls, and he kisses it.

                               ISHMAEL (a whisper)
                     Just say yes.

     No answer.  Not knowing what to say, she winds an arm behind his
     head, and brings him nearer.  His mouth opens into hers, with more
     force, more of his heart, than he has ever given.  Deep and tender.
     His hands reach beneath her dress...

     ...peel her panties down her thighs...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     When something that means your
                     whole life.  Is the last time ever...

     And suddenly, he is OVER her, drawing her legs up around him...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     God should tell you.  Or it's not
                     fair.

     Her head tilts back, her eyes squeeze closed.  And as he enters
     her...

                               ISHMAEL (whispers)
                     Please say yes...

     ...her hands GRASP his upper arms.  And push away.

                               HATSUE (softly)
                     No.

     And he blinks.  As if waking from a dream.  Everything has stopped.
     Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret.

                               HATSUE
                     No.  No.  It isn't right.

     So he draws away.  Stunned, uncomprehending.  Watching with blank
     eyes, as she stares up at him.  Then, with dignity and tenderness,
     he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...

                               ISHMAEL
                     It felt right to me.  It felt
                     like getting married.

     She draws her legs up.  Kneeling now, putting her hands on his
     face...

     But no words come.  No words.  Until...

                               HATSUE
                     I'll write you.

     And KISSES him fiercely, and BOLTS up before he can grab her,
     RUNNING off like a deer, while he...

     ...kneels.  His mouth open.  Like a silent scream.

     EXT. AMITY HARBOR FERRY - MORNING

     An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air.
     Hesitantly, looking in all directions, Fujiko, Hatsue, and her four
     sisters climb from the truck, to see...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     On Monday, March 30, 1942, the
                     United States Army graciously
                     transported the Imada women to
                     the docks.

     ...a ferry, the KEHLOKEN, stands waiting.  Soldiers are dis-
     tributing tags for luggage and coats.  The evacuees, mostly women,
     stand in the cold, trying to smile bravely for each other.  And
     lined against the railing...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Lifelong neighbors came to watch.
                     Curiosity masked as kindness...

     ...a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors
     file toward the ferry.  A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who
     casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting.  And
     just as they reach the gangway...

     ...Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance,
     among a group of students.  She pauses.  Her eyes hold his for a
     heartbeat...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...with some exceptions.

     The wisp of a smile.  And she is gone.

     EXT. IMADA FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

     Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch.  Snow is no
     longer falling.  She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively.
     The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain
     impenetrability of her Asian exterior.  She closes her eyes, and...

     ...draws deep on the smoke.  The act seems to cause her pain.  When
     the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded.  Nowhere to turn.
     The next puff looks desperate, and she FLIPS the cigarette out onto
     the snow.  Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her
     feet against the cold, the helplessness.  And looks out...

     ...strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered
     moonlight, become...

     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT

     ...a moonlit DESERT.  PAN the barbed wire, the distant barracks,
     the desolation.  Come to...

     ...two women walking alone.  The younger one glancing at her mother
     as they go.  Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead.
     The barracks, everything, in distance behind them.

                               HATSUE
                     You think we're far enough
                     away now?

     No sarcasm in the voice.  She lets the words carry her irony.
     Her mother stops.  Looks at her so directly, so strong.  Even her
     tough-minded daughter flinches slightly.

                               HATSUE
                     Mom, whatever this is, they don't
                     keep war secrets this carefully.

     Fujiko thinks that over.  Nods.

                               FUJIKO
                     Secrets are hard to keep.

     She goes over to a large, flat rock.  Sits down.  Pulls two sheets
     of paper from her coat.  And waits.  As her daughter comes and
     crouches at her feet.  Fujiko clears her throat.

                               FUJIKO
                     This letter.  Was opened.
                     By mistake.

     And watches.  As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask.
     Silence.  Then...

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'My love.  I still go to our
                     cedar tree in the afternoons every
                     day.  I shut my eyes, waiting.'

     Hatsue has turned to stone.  To ice.  Wind blows.

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'I smell your smell.  And I dream
                     of you.  And I ache for you to come
                     home.  So I can hold you and feel
                     you near.'

     Fujiko scans the page silently.  Turns to the second...

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'After all these years that we've
                     been together, I find you're a
                     part of me.  Without you, I have
                     nothing.  All my love, forever...'

     And looks up.  Her eyes calm, quiet.

                               FUJIKO
                     The neighborhood boy.  Who taught
                     you to swim?

     The look holds.  And holds.

                               HATSUE
                     You shouldn't have opened that.
                     It was mi...

                               FUJIKO (so quiet)
                     How deceitful of me.

     Anger only at the edges.  Like finely-honed steel.

                               FUJIKO
                     How can I ever hope.  For your
                     forgiveness.

     The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them.  They seem not to
     notice.

                               FUJIKO
                     I have written this letter to
                     the boy's parents...

     She pulls out a single page.  Hands it down to her daughter.
     Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words.

                               FUJIKO
                     Attraction is no crime, certainly
                     among children.  The dishonor
                     lies in the concealment.  From
                     your families.

     Watches her daughter reading.  And quietly...

                               FUJIKO
                     I know that you know this.  I know
                     you have suffered.  Even if the
                     hakujin could not.

     Silence.  Hatsue's eyes cast down.  She folds the page.

                               FUJIKO
                     There will be no further letters.
                     No contact of any k...

     And stops.  Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two.  She looks
     up.  Into her mother's shock.

                               HATSUE
                     One more letter.  I will write
                     it.  You may read it, and send
                     it for me.

     Her mother's anger fades.  Into interest.

                               HATSUE
                     I deceived more than you.  I
                     deceived this sweet boy.  And
                     myself.  It was never love.

     Never love.  The mother's face changes.  There is understanding,
     acceptance.  Even pride.

                               HATSUE
                     I will work hard.  To earn your
                     forgiveness.

     A sigh.  A sadness deep, beyond her years.

                               HATSUE
                     I can never hope for his.

     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Mother and daughter enter their crude quarters.  They find Hatsue's
     sisters sitting on the wooden floor, watching...

     ...a team of young MEN, working with tools and pieces of lumber.
     One is building shelves, two others, a chest of drawers.  Their
     leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the
     floor.  One girl beams at her mother...

                               SUMIKO
                     These boys are buildings us
                     a mansion!

     The leader grins and rises.  Bows slightly to Fujiko.  He is, of
     course...

                               KABUO
                     I'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada.

     The woman smiles.  Bows slightly in return.

                               FUJIKO
                     We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san.
                     How are your parents, your family...?

                               KABUO
                     My father is sick with the camp
                     food.  The rest of us are fine.
                     Don't speak of dept, please, we
                     just want to help.

     And glances.  To the eldest daughter.  In the doorway.

                               KABUO
                     Hi, Hatsue, remember me?

     She looks back, without expression.  There is much on her mind.
     His smile is handsome, easy.

                               KABUO
                     I was a senior when you were a
                     junior.  But I've seen you around.

     She tosses her hair free of the parka.  Gathers it in her hands.
     Saying only...

                               HATSUE
                     Hello.

     Can't win a smile, but he doesn't seem to mind.

                               KABUO
                     Nice to see you.

     EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE REAR PORCH - NIGHT

     Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch.  He draws from
     his coat a black CIGAR.  Box of matches.  The cigar goes into his
     mouth.  With amazing dexterity...

     ...he slips a single match from the box, turns his face to the
     wall, and still palming the box, STRIKES a match on the buckle of
     his belt, bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical
     puffs before the match dies.  He turns toward...

     ...the fields.  Stretching treeless, endless, seemingly to the
     horizon.  Bathed in filtered moonlight, they become...

     EXT. TARAWA ATOLL - NIGHT

     ...the shimmering Pacific.  We are with Ishmael in an LCVP landing
     craft, as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon.  Bobbing past two
     DESTROYERS firing in waves at the beach.  Ishmael and his platoon
     mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw
     fire on the sand, one exploding in flame.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Her letter reached me on the North
                     Island of New Zealand.  So I had a
                     month to think it over...

     Men around him are shouting, cursing, jostling against each other,
     frightened out of their minds, as SHELLS POUND the ocean, horrify-
     ingly huge and near.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I wrote her four times.  'I hate
                     you with all my heart.  I hate you,
                     Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'

     Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef.  They are
     still 300 yards from shore.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I never sent the letters.  I wanted
                     to kill as many Japs as possible.

                               SQUAD LEADER
                     MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT,
                     LET'S GO!!

     The SQUAD LEADER goes over the side, Ishmael and others follow,
     struggling with 85 pound packs.  As Ishmael hits the water, the
     squad leader is SHOT in the face, a man five yards from Ishmael has
     the top of his head BLOWN AWAY, men are DROPPING in numbers under
     the WITHERING BURSTS of fire, the deafening ordnance sweeping over
     the SHRIEKS of terror and agony, and Ishmael...

     ...submerges behind his pack, splashing hard, keeping its bulk
     ahead of him as a shield, until he can wade and swim and plunge
     toward shore, as hellfire CRASHES everywhere, dead bodies floating,
     machine-gun blasts WHIPPING the water's surface, Ishmael at...

     ...the shallows now, men rising to make a run at the seawall, being
     CUT DOWN, Ishmael crouching in the water, watching other men draw
     fire, and in a moment's lull, four of them and Ishmael...

     ...GO for it, lungs BURSTING, pounding MADLY up the sand, one
     SHOT DEAD, another SCREAMS as his knee is blown away and goes down
     writhing, as three men...

     ...MAKE IT to the wall.  Gasping, puking, shivering with cold and
     fright.  They have no gear, no weapons.  One of them is Ishmael.
     He looks back to...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death.
                     Thirty yards away.

     Bullets FLYING everywhere, CHEWING up the sand.  The young man
     twitching, pleading...

                               BLEDSOE (crying)
                     Oh, shit, please, please help me
                     you guys, come on, help me, fucking
                     help me, PLEASE...!

     And flat against the seawall, three men watch.  Not daring to look
     at each other.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I knew nothing could save him.  Hell,
                     I didn't have so much as a band-aid.
                     I also knew I was a coward.  For not
                     giving up my life to try.

     EXT. SEAWALL - DAY

     Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others.  Sixty or
     so men mill in the shadow of the seawall.  The beach is littered
     with dead marines and wounded, calling for help.  As Ishmael
     glances up, a SERGEANT leaps ONTO the seawall, cigarette dangling
     from his mouth...

                               SERGEANT
                     You pussies are the kinda chickenshits
                     deserve to have your balls chewed
                     off real slow when this is over!

     Stands with his hands on his hips.  The men below him properly
     mesmerized.

                               SERGEANT
                     Any man who won't follow me over
                     this wall is a cornhole-fucker with
                     a half-inch hard-on wh...

     The words CUT OFF by the shell that RIPS THROUGH his spine, OPENING
     his shirt front as he PITCHES forward FLAT upon the sand.

     No one looks.  No one speaks.  It never happened.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I wanted to live.  And I didn't
                     know why.

     EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

     Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete.  PULL BACK to reveal
     300 MARINES all down the wall, a striking force assembled from the
     survivors of multiple landings.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Some colonel came down the beach.
                     Any man who didn't go over the wall
                     at 2100 would be court-martialed,
                     disgraced and imprisoned...

     Every man lining up now, rifles at the ready.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     The captain who followed said shot
                     on sight.

     They seem more resigned, or is it stunned numb, than terrified.
     There is no interaction.  Each man dealing with his own insides.
     And suddenly...

     ...squad leaders go OVER THE WALL, the firing ERUPTS, and three
     hundred marines SCRAMBLE into the teeth of it, mortar and machine-
     gun BARRAGE lighting the sky from the row of battered palm trees,
     Ishmael SPRINTING, the man next to him goes DOWN, Ishmael TURNS
     instinctively, and a shot...

     ...RIPS into his left bicep, SPINNING him OFF his feet in SLO-MO,
     falling to dirt as all goes...

     BLACK.

     INT. SHIPBOARD OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael feverish, writhing unconscious against the straps that
     hold him to a table.  All around him, a hell of men and blood
     and doctors and limbs and shouted curses they never showed us
     on M.A.S.H.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     My arm was dealt with by a
                     pharmacist's mate, whose surgical
                     career was four hours old.

     Ishmael LURCHES, his eyes pop OPEN, wild and bleary...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     He used a handsaw.

     ...seeing there, in a corner, on a pile of blood-soaked
     dressings...

     ...his left arm.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I dream of it, now and then.
                     The way my fingers curled.
                     Against the wall.

     He blinks at it.  Realizing at last that the arm is his...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     ...fucking goddam Jap bitch!

     An ORDERLY turns at the words.  Nods.  As if he knows.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It was all I could think of to say.

     His eyes squeeze shut.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     There was nothing more to say.
                     For a long while.

     INT. KABUO'S CELL - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on a dark blue suit.  Clean shirt.  Hanging on a hook against
     the green wall.  PAN ACROSS the bars in the cell door's tiny
     window.  All is dark out there, and silent.  Here...

     ...the bare bulb glows.  Its light throws shadows of castles and
     horses across the chessboard.

     Kabuo cross-legged on the floor, alone.  His back erect.  His eyes
     calm.  Stare at the pieces.

     EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

     Kabuo at 19 sits on the earth.  By a shovel.  By a lantern.  This
     place is shielded by trees.  PAN across the ground to...

     ...his father.  Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap
     sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth.  Wooden swords, hakama
     pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care.  Dialogue plays in
     subtitled JAPANESE...

                               ZENHICHI
                     Your great-grandfather was a
                     samurai, a magnificent soldier.

     The father never looks at the son.  Only at his work.

                               ZENHICHI
                     He killed himself.  On the
                     battlefield.  At Kumamoto.

     The boy knows this.  Yet his entire being is focused on every word.

                               ZENHICHI
                     He went to battle with a sword.
                     Against rifles, mind you.  Knowing
                     what honor required.

     An elegant SWORD.  Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light.

                               ZENHICHI
                     He was angry.  To the point of
                     being crazy, yes.  But he knew
                     what honor.  Required.

     A separate sack, just for this.  Folded with respect.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Honor can require loyalty.
                     Revenge.  Death.

     It goes into the ground.  With the others.  He seems nearly
     overcome now.  By some emotion that sweeps through him.  Prompting
     the boy to murmur...

                               KABUO
                     These are safe, father.  The
                     hakujin will never f...

                               ZENHICHI (quietly)
                     ...it is the only scale...

     Meaning, be still.  So the boy is still.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Only scale.  In which our worth.
                     Is weighed.

     The man gazes into the hole.  At his treasures.

                               ZENHICHI
                     Every life ends.  And if it ends
                     dishonored.  It is as if...

     And turns to his son.  To complete the words.

                               KABUO (in English)
                     ...we have never lived.

     There is love.  There is strength.  There is no more to say.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Sheriff Moran sits in the witness box, blade-thin and fidgeting
     ever so slightly.  Uncomfortable in the limelight.  In his hands
     are four pieces of ROPE.

                               MORAN
                     Well, this one here comes off
                     Miyamoto's boat.  Matches all his
                     others, worn equal and so on.  But
                     this one here...

     Holds it up for Hooks.  So the jury can see.

                               MORAN
                     ...comes off third cleat from the
                     stern, port side.  And it's brand
                     new.  Unlike the rest.

                               HOOKS
                     And the next one...?

                               MORAN
                     From Carl Heine's boat.  All his
                     were like this one, three-strand
                     manila, new condition, braided in
                     loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.

                               HOOKS
                     And the last...?

                               MORAN
                     Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard
                     side, second cleat from the stern.
                     But it doesn't match Carl's lines.
                     It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.

     Ah.  Hooks nods.  Significant.

                               HOOKS
                     So if defendant had tied up
                     to deceased's boat.  With that
                     last one.  Would those cleats
                     have lined up?

                               MORAN
                     You bet.  And if Miyamoto there
                     had been in a hurry to cast off,
                     he coulda left this line behind
                     on Carl's boat.

                               HOOKS
                     And replaced it later with the
                     new one.  That's your inference?

                               MORAN
                     Pretty darn clear.

     I see.  Hooks begins to pace.  Toward the jury.

                               HOOKS
                     And when you visited defendant on
                     his boat.  The evening after Carl
                     Heine's death.  Did it seem pretty
                     darn clear to him?

     EXT. THE ISLANDER - NIGHT

     Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat.  He is sliding a
     new BATTERY into place.  Beside its older companion.  He bolts it
     down.  Starts his engine.  He is visibly tense.  As he steps onto
     the deck, he sees...

     ...two figures at the pilings.  Sheriff Moran makes a cutting
     motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line.

                               MORAN
                     Cut your engine, we're coming
                     aboard.

     Kabuo doesn't move.  The tension has fled beneath the surface.  His
     face now a mask.

                               KABUO
                     What for, Sheriff?

                               MORAN
                     We have a warrant.  To search
                     your boat.

     He holds it up.  Abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything.

                               KABUO
                     Well, what are you looking f...

                               MORAN (calmly)
                     A murder weapon.  We think you
                     might be responsible for the death
                     of Carl Heine.

     Kabuo blinks.  As if hearing a foreign language.  Words that do not
     compute.

                               KABUO
                     Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl,
                     it sure as hell wasn't me.

     Moran steps from the dock ONTO the boat, Abel awkwardly following.

                               MORAN
                     Then let's get this over with, so
                     you can get to fishin'.  Now, cut
                     yor engine.

     And walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across
     everything.  Kabuo follows, killing the engine.  And in the sudden
     silence, Moran's beam finds...

     ...the still-open battery well.

                               MORAN
                     You always run with the well open?

                               KABUO
                     I was checking the cables.

     Moran's light moves over the batteries.

                               MORAN
                     D-6s, huh?

     And says no more.  Runs his beam once more around the cabin.

                               MORAN
                     We'll come back, let's take a
                     look at the stern.

     Off he goes.  Kabuo's glance goes to the open well.  Then follows,
     noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow.  But in the stern,
     Moran is shining his light.  Third cleat.  Port side.

                               MORAN
                     See you replaced a mooring line,
                     lately.  This one's new.

                               KABUO
                     Naw, I had that around for a while.

                               MORAN
                     Sure you did.  Help me with this
                     hold cover, willya?

     So Kabuo slides the cover away.  They peer in.

                               KABUO
                     There's nothin' to see.  I need to
                     get out there fi...

                               ABEL (O.S.)
                     Art.  Looka this.

     He has the fishing GAFF.  Three-and-a-half feet long.  Steel hook
     at one end.  Hands it to Moran.

                               ABEL
                     There's blood on it.

                               KABUO
                     Fish blood, I gaff fish with that.

     Moran carefully examines the object.

                               MORAN
                     You gaff with the hook end.
                     Blood's on the butt.  Where
                     your hand goes.

                               KABUO
                     Sure.  Blood gets all over your
                     hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.

     Moran takes out a handkerchief.  Holds the gaff with it.

                               MORAN
                     Gonna have this tested.  Now you
                     go home, okay?  Wait til you hear
                     from me.

     Kabuo's heart is racing.

                               KABUO
                     Sheriff, I can't afford not to
                     fish toni...

                               MORAN
                     Look, no way I'm lettin' you out
                     there.  In a half hour you could
                     be in Canada.

     Kabuo's face has gone dead.  Which makes it seem somehow fierce,
     almost threatening.  And the sheriff is watching that.

                               MORAN
                     I'm sorry, son.  But you're under
                     arrest.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Moran still on the stand.  The ropes are gone now.  His hands
     interlock across his narrow thighs.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Now your testimony was interrupted
                     yesterday, when that power line
                     set fire to your mother-in-law's
                     farmhouse...

     Art looks really irritated.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     How is your mother-in-law?

                               MORAN
                     She's alright, Nels, thanks
                     for asking.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     And her farmhouse...?

                               MORAN
                     The damage was considerable.
                     But she's insured.  Thanks, again.

     See Nels now.  Avuncular as hell.  Bemused by Moran's annoyance.

                               NELS
                     Well, just to put it back in
                     our minds, could you repeat what
                     you told us.  About the type of
                     batteries you found.  One Carl's boat.

     Moran sighs.  Tries to be patient.

                               MORAN
                     One D-6 and one D-8 in the well.
                     And a dead D-8 on the deck.

                               NELS
                     Which you inferred was replaced by
                     the D-6, which must have been a spare.

                               MORAN
                     What else could it be?

                               NELS
                     Even though a D-6 is too big, and
                     the flange had to be banged out to
                     squeeze it in.
                              (beat)
                     Which makes it a peculiar choice.
                     For a spare.

                               MORAN
                     You said that.  That was your
                     testimony.

     Everybody laughs.  Including Nels.

                               NELS (chuckling)
                     I guess I'm a pretty smart feller,
                     after all.  And what were the type
                     batteries you found on defendant's
                     boat?

                               MORAN (bland)
                     D-6s.  Like I sa...

                               NELS
                     No further questions.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     DR. STERLING WHITMAN sits in his expensive suit, a giant of a man
     whose towering frame ill fits the witness box.  His eyes are small
     and blue, and carry the weight of superiority with practiced ease.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So the blood on the gaff was not
                     fish blood at all.  It was human,
                     yes?  Type B positive.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     Carl Heine's type.

     Nels nodding.  Seemingly unconcerned by this fact.

                               NELS
                     But you can't say with any certainty
                     that the blood was his.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     No, but as I say, the type is rare.
                     Ten percent of Caucasian males.

                               NELS
                     And the blood could not have
                     belonged to defendant.  Seeing
                     that his type is O negative.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     That's obvious.

                               NELS
                     You scraped the dried blood from
                     the butt of the gaff.  Where a fella's
                     hand goes.  And what did you see under
                     your microscope, besides the B positive
                     blood and the wood scrapings...?

     And the witness stops.  A curious question.  But Nels is waiting.
     With an expectant smile.

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     Bits of blood and wood.  What else
                     would there be?

                               NELS
                     No bits of bone, no particles of
                     scalp, no strands of hair?

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     None.

                               NELS
                     Well, if the blood got onto the
                     gaff by crushing a man's skull...

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was
                     asked only t...

                               NELS (gently persistent)
                     ...would that seem logical?

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     I don't know.

                               NELS
                     You don't.

     Nels lifts the gaff off the table.  Looks at it.

                               NELS
                     The coroner testified that Carl
                     Heine had a cut.  A fresh cut.
                     Probably one or two hours old.

     And grasps the butt end.  Of the gaff.

                               NELS
                     On the palm.  Of his right hand.

     Walks, dragging one leg just slightly, toward the box.  And holding
     the butt of the gaff toward him...

                               NELS
                     With no bone or scalp or hair
                     present.  Would it be more probable
                     that the blood came from crushing
                     a man's skull...

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.

                               NELS
                     ...or from the cut on his hand.
                     Which is more probable?

     Whitman won't be badgered.  His smile carries only a trace of
     coldness...

                               DR. WHITMAN
                     It is not my function.  To weigh
                     those probabilities.

     Nels looks him over.

                               NELS
                     You're right.

     And turns his back.  Walks away.

                               NELS
                     ...that's the jury's job.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks in pin-stripe serge today.  Pommaded hair, glossy wing-tips.
     He is crisp.

                               HOOKS
                     Now this regiment you were training,
                     the 442nd, this was all Nisei boys...

     First Sergeant VICTOR MAPLES wears his green dress uniform,
     splashed with decorations.  Thick and powerful, no neck, razor cut.
     The eyes are alive.

                               MAPLES
                     They were Japanese-American boys,
                     yes sir.

                               HOOKS
                     And you were generally experienced
                     in training men for hand-to-hand
                     combat.

                               MAPLES
                     It was my specialty, sir, I trained
                     several thousand over the years.

                               HOOKS
                     So.  Wide cross-section of men to
                     evaluate.  And the day that the
                     defendant volunteered for this...
                     demonstration.  Did you find him
                     eager?

                               MAPLES
                     More than eager.  He was out to
                     make a point.

     Hooks finds that interesting.  Begins to pace.

                               HOOKS
                     And what point.  Was that.

     EXT. TRAINING FIELD, CAMP SHELBY, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     The squad of Nisei recruits, one hundred young Asian faces,
     surround Sgt. Maples.  He paces before them, holding up a wooden
     staff, looking in their eyes...

                               MAPLES
                     Anyone.

     And Kabup steps forward.  Bows slightly.  Then salutes...

                               KABUO
                     SIR!

     Maples stares.  Hard.

                               MAPLES
                     You don't salute me, you don't
                     call me 'sir', soldier, I'm an
                     enlisted man.

     Kabuo stares back.  Blank.

                               MAPLES
                     And nobody bows in this man's
                     Army, you're in America, son.
                     Not Japan.

                               KABUO
                     I'm sorry, sir, force of habit.

                               MAPLES
                     No more 'sir'.  That's the last
                     of that.

     Tosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet.  A little hard.  As Kabuo
     slips the helmet on...

                               MAPLES
                     The exercise is avoiding thrusts.
                     Now, first y...

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Ready, sergeant.

     Cut off in mid-word, Maples glares back.  Are you?  THRUSTS
     sharply, but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more
     than an inch.  Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, Maples unleashes...

     ...a SAVAGE series of THRUSTS at blinding SPEED, and Kabuo...

     ...SLIPS them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move.  As a man
     might toy with a child.  Maples studies the face for any trace of
     mockery.  And sees nothing at all.  STABS out, only to have Kabuo...

     ...SLASH Maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to
     be nearly invisible.  Maples clearly STUNNED by the display.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Excuse me.

     He bends, picks up Maples' staff, hands it to him.  And bows.
     Slightly.  The sergeant is hot.  He looks into the faces of this
     Nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk.  There is none.

                               MAPLES
                     Are you ready for some simulated
                     combat, soldier?

                               KABUO
                     For combat.  Sergeant.

     And Maples LUNGES with surprising speed, to be SWEPT off his feet
     in a BLUR, lying FLAT on the earth, his head PINNED to the ground
     by the tip of Kabuo's staff.

     A hush.  Kabuo withdraws his staff.  Retrieves Maples'...

                               KABUO (just above a whisper)
                     Your weapon, sergeant.

     And bows.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Maples smiling easily.  Like a guy telling the story in a bar.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, what then, sergeant?

                               MAPLES
                     What else?  I had the boy teach
                     me kendo.  Including...the importance
                     of the bow.

     Everyone laughs.  Maples the loudest.  Hooks smiles like a regular
     Joe.

                               HOOKS
                     And your evaluation of the
                     defendant?  Could he kill a much
                     larger man with a fishing gaff?
                     So quickly, there would be no
                     sign of struggle?

                               MAPLES
                     Oh, in a heartbeat.

     And the smiles are gone.  All around.

                               MAPLES
                     Able and willing.  Like few men
                     I've ever seen.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hooks sits against the prosecution table.  His demeanor gentle,
     respectful.  His voice soft.

                               HOOKS
                     So the plan was for your husband
                     to fish through the prime season.
                     Then, in November, sell the boat.
                     And you would move onto the farm.

     In the box, the widow sits in lovely dignity.  Blonde and alabaster
     and modest, in her black dress of mourning.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     That was his plan, yes.

     In the press row, the boys are attentive.  An angle they know they
     can sell.  Ishmael among them, watching with neutral eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Whatever she said, she was Hooks'
                     star witness.  The jury, especially
                     the men, would not betray this fine
                     lady with a not guilty verdict.  How
                     could they face her?

     Hooks walks slowly toward her.  As if she were a precious object,
     deserving of reverence.

                               HOOKS
                     Can you think back for me to the
                     morning of September 8?  The day
                     after your husband purchased the
                     farm.  One week before his death.
                     Can you recall that morning?

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I can.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     A bright bathroom, filled with STEAM, filtering the sunlight.  PUSH
     toward the opaque shower door, TOWARD the sound of rushing water.
     And of breathing.  THROUGH it to...

     ...Susan Marie and her husband.  Her arms are wound about his neck.
     Her legs wrapped around his body, feet locked behind the small of
     his back.  Carl holds her high with his strong hands, so he can
     lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow, slow thrusts.  Her wet
     blonde hair is pasted across her face, and her eyes are closed.
     The intensity holds us.

     INT. PARLOR - MORNING

     CLOSE on a paint brush.  It rests across the lid of a can of wood
     stain.  See now...

     ...Susan Marie kneeling by the table she is refinishing.  But her
     hands, her body, are motionless.  Her eyes stare out the window...

     ...across the yard.  Her towering husband walks beside a smaller
     man.  Carl is doing the talking.  Kabuo's face is stone.

     INT. PARLOR - LATER

     Susan Marie sits quietly in a rocker, nursing her baby.  Her hands
     tenderly stroke the feeding infant.  But her eyes are attentive.
     Concerned.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     What could I tell him?  There's
                     my mother to think about.  You
                     know what she'd say?

     Susan Marie knows.  What Etta would say.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     I said I'd think it over, talk
                     with you.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Did he go away angry?

     See Carl now, pacing his own parlor like a caged bear.  Agitated in
     a way we could not have expected.

                               CARL
                     He kept talkin' about those seven
                     acres belonged to his father, and
                     how honorable and decent his father
                     was.  His meaning was pretty clear.
                     And I didn't much like it.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     You had a scrap.

     Nursing her baby.  Calm, direct.

                               CARL
                     I couldn't...talk to him.  Look,
                     Kabuo's a Jap.  And I don't hate
                     Japs, but I don't like 'em neither.
                     It's hard to explain if you weren't
                     in the war, you know?

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     He's not a Jap.  You don't mean
                     that.  You and he were friends.

     And Carl turns.  Looks at her.  A full beat.

                               CARL
                     We were kids.

     He looks helpless.  Frustrated.  He doesn't want his anger to spill
     onto her.

     He leaves the room.  Without a word.  HOLD on her.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Susan Marie's cornflower eyes are set.  Wary.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So your husband said he's think
                     it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto
                     to believe he might sell to h...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I wouldn't say encouraged.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Well, he didn't say 'no', did he?
                     Didn't say no hope existed.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Not in those words.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     So the defendant was encouraged
                     to hope.  Or could have been.

     She thinks about this.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I guess so.

     Nels is nodding.  Nodding.

                               NELS
                     I guess you'd have to guess.
                     Not having been there with them.
                     Having to guess whether your husband's
                     report was word for word accurate.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Carl never lied.

                               NELS
                     Of course not.  But it was
                     emotional.  A friend's plea set
                     against his mother's attitude.

     And then.  As if it had just occurred to him...

                               NELS
                     Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant
                     ever aim one of those at you?

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     He had no reason to.

                               NELS
                     Carl ever say he got one?

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     I can't speak for him.

                               NELS
                     You can speak for what he said.
                     Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     Objection, badgering the wi...

     CLICK.  All the lights in the courtroom go OUT.  A loud murmur.  A
     FLICKER of light.  Then, they go OUT again.

     The crowd BUZZES, laughs, the gavel RAPS.  The lights come ON.  A
     collective sound of relief.  The gavel AGAIN.  Finally, silence.

                               NELS
                     Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine.
                     Shall I repeat the ques...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     Carl said he didn't like Kabuo
                     much anymore.

     A silence.  A deep one.

                               NELS
                     The question is more about the
                     defendant's attitu...

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     That's all he said.

     She arches her throat.

                               SUSAN MARIE
                     And we can't ask him anymore.

     INT. ISHMAEL'S DESOTO, CENTER VALLEY - TWILIGHT

     Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry
     fields of Center Valley.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     My father had bought the DeSoto
                     fifteen years before.  Driving it
                     reminded me of him.  Which I
                     considered a neutral fact...

     He turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for
     his convenience.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Actually, it was pleasant.

     Following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Snow made all the fields into one.
                     The notion that one man might kill
                     another for a small patch, made no
                     sense.

     Up ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch.  A middle
     aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     But I knew such things occurred.
                     Having been to war and all.

     The man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter
     working with a shovel behind the car.  Ishmael pulls up behind
     them.  And gets out.

     He crunches over to where Hisao works...

                               ISHMAEL
                     May I give you folks a lift?

     Hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair
     from her eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I didn't look at her.  I thought
                     that would be best.

     Her eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side.
     Murmurs to him in Japanese.  WHen he answers, she turns to face
     Ishmael...

                               HATSUE
                     My father is grateful for your
                     kindness.  But he will free his
                     car, shortly.

     Ishmael smiles softly.  This car isn't going anywhere.  He goes to
     Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Okay, I'll help.

     INT. DESOTO, SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT

     Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I know it's caused you trouble.
                     But don't you think the snow is
                     beautiful, coming down?

     His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror.  She stares out
     the side window, concentrating on the world.  Two strands of wet
     hair pasted against her cheek.

                               HISAO
                     Yes, very beautiful.

     Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart
     away.  Hers hold.

                               HATSUE
                     This trial is unfair.  You should
                     write about that in your newspaper.

     He keeps driving.  And he keeps his eyes on the road.

                               ISHMAEL (calmly)
                     What should I say?

                               HATSUE
                     Just that.  This trial is wrong,
                     they are calling a good man a killer.
                     It is only about prejudice, and that
                     is unfair.

     He thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him.

                               ISHMAEL
                     We all expect the world to be fair.
                     As if we have some right t...

                               HATSUE
                     I don't mean everyone.  Just people
                     who can do things because they can
                     arrest people or convict them.  Or
                     run a newspaper.

     And his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe I should write a column.
                     What do you think?

     She studies his face.

                               HATSUE
                     What do you think?

     No smile.  On either side.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I think people.  Should be fair.

     His eyes on the road now.  The farmhouse seen through the drifting
     screen of white.

                               HATSUE
                     Will you write that?

     Her voice is soft.  The difference is palpable.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I might just.

     His voice is kindness and friendship.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I was part of her life again.  I
                     was a person.

     EXT. COAST GUARD LIGHTHOUSE, POINT WHITE - DUSK

     A tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the
     sea.  Ishmael's hand in his pocket.  Trudging toward it.

     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - DUSK

     Ishmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling
     with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags.  Our host is
     LEVANT, a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a
     huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair.  He gestures around the
     room at all the records.  Voila.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You have the night watch?  On the
                     radio.

                               LEVANT
                     Since September.  Last guys got
                     transferred.

     Ishmael looks around.  There is a lot of stuff.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And you keep the records, or
                     contribute to 'em.

                               LEVANT
                     Shorthard the radio transmis-
                     sions, write 'em up, file 'em
                     in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks.
                     Just take up space.

     Ishmael nods.  Guess so.

                               ISHMAEL
                     All kinds of radio transmissions?
                     Fisherman in trouble, and such.

     Innocent question.  Random example.

                               LEVANT
                     All kinds.  Make yourself at home.

     And leaves.  Ishmael looks at the task before him.  Then, out
     the window.  Dark now.  His reflection stares back.  As troubled
     as he is.

     INT. PETERSEN'S GROCERIES - DAY

     Ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a
     grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the
     elbow.  He turns the corner to see...

     ...three people in line at the register.  The second is Hatsue.  An
     infant carried at her shoulder.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I'd been back two months.  It was
                     the first time I'd seen her.

     He joins the line.  The CHECKER glances his way, then looks
     awkwardly down.  This makes the others turn.  And Hatsue's eyes.
     Meet his.

                               HATSUE
                     Hello.

     The voice, the face, are cool and formal.  There is no anger, no
     unkindness.  Only the absence of warmth.  Ishmael nods.  His face
     hard, stricken.  His heart pounds in his throat.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I couldn't say anything.  I just
                     stood there, hating her.

                               HATSUE
                     I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and
                     I.  Are very sor...

                               ISHMAEL
                     The Japs did it.

     No one knows where to look.  Down, away, anything.  But Hatsue
     never blinks.

                               ISHMAEL
                     They shot it off.  At Tarawa.

     She holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow.  Somewhere between
     compassion and pity.  Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her
     shoulder.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that.

     All the feeling comes to his eyes.  Everything he will never tell
     her.  A murmur...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry about everything.  All
                     of it.

     He drops his milk and crackers on the counter.

     And walks away.

     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael sits alone.  Beyond the glass, a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the
     sea, the snow-covered shore.  But Ishmael stares at a folder.  Open
     in his lap.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     September 16.  At 1:42 A.M., the
                     dead of night.  The S.S. West Corona,
                     a Greek-owned freighter, was lost.
                     In heavy fog.

     His finger.  Traces a line of the report.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     They radioed to the lighthouse.
                     They would have to dogleg, bisecting
                     Ship Channel Bank.  And Seaman Philip
                     Milholland wrote that down.  In his
                     report.

     Ishmael closes his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Carl Heine drowned.  In Ship
                     Channel Bank.  And his watch
                     stopped.  At 1:47.

     He looks out through the glass.  As if he could watch it happen.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     A huge freighter plowing through.
                     Throwing a wake big enough to fling
                     any man overboard.

     And Ishmael removes the page from the file.  Slowly, he folds it
     into quarters.  Slides it into his coat pocket.

                               ISHMAEL (calls out)
                     Seaman...?

     And closes the file.  Slips it back into the cabinet.  Levant
     appears, vaguely irritated by the summons.  So Ishmael smiles.
     Sorry, nothing important.

                               ISHMAEL
                     How long you have this detail?

                               LEVANT
                     Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch
                     September 16.

     Ishmael's face.  Just to clarify...

                               ISHMAEL
                     You mean, early morning the 16th?

                               LEVANT
                     No, night of the 16th, morning the
                     17th.  We replaced two guys named
                     Miller and Milholland.

     Oh.  Ishmael nods.

                               LEVANT
                     They got transferred that day.
                     Out to Cape Flattery.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Some seaman's loast report.
                     Stuffed in a cabinet, good as
                     lost forever.  No one knows.

     Ishmael rises, stiffly.  Starts to pull on his coat.

                               LEVANT
                     You get what you come for?

     And Ishmael looks at the youngster.  A little oddly.  Admits...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Guess I'm not completely sure.
                     What that was.

     EXT. FLETCHER'S BAY - MORNING

     Ishmael at 24, crouched among trees.  Above a sunlit stretch of
     beach.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I left the grocery, and wrote a
                     letter.  I apologizes from my heart.
                     I should never have said that word
                     to her.  I never would again.

     CLOSE on his face.  Eyes gazing down.  At something.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     It sat in my desk for two weeks.
                     Before I threw it away.

     He sighs.  Rises slowly.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I knew her car.  And sometimes
                     when I'd see it, I'd...drive that
                     way.  At a distance.

     See Hatsue down on the beach.  Alone, raking for steamer clams.
     Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella.

     Ishmael walks down to the sand.  Crosses to where she works.  And
     squats down.  At a respectful distance.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Can I talk to you?

     She must have seen who was coming.  Because the words do not
     startle her.  Or slow her work.

                               HATSUE
                     I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't
                     right for us to be alone.  People
                     will t...

                               ISHMAEL
                     There's no one here, and I've got
                     to talk to you.

     Her back is to him.  She is motionless.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Don't you owe me that?

     And she turns.  Her eyes go first to her sleeping child.  Then she
     walks over, and sinks to the sand.  Just before him.  Near enough
     to touch.

     She looks in his eyes.  And waits.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm like a dying person.

     The words just came out.  His eyes move over her face.  His aching
     for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I don't sleep.  I tell myself this
                     can't go on, but it goes on anyway.

     He seems at the edge of insanity.  Or tears.

                               HATSUE
                     I did a terrible thing, Ishmael.
                     I knew what you felt.  And what I
                     didn't.

     Sadness in her voice.  But strength as well.

                               HATSUE
                     And I never found the courage to
                     tell you.

     His eyes swim with tears.  He chokes them back, he has to.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You'll think this is crazy, but all
                     I want is to hold you.  Just once.
                     And smell your hair.

     She absorbs this.  No sign of repulsion or anger.  Her eyes seem
     wise.  And very sad.

                               HATSUE
                     You have to hear this, I can
                     never touch you, Ishmael.  Not
                     once, not ever.  There's no half-
                     way.  As much as I know it hurts
                     you, you have to let this go.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Look, I want to forget you, I do.
                     I think if you hold me, just this
                     once, I can walk away and never
                     speak to you again.

     She just keeps looking at him.  There is a bravery to her steady
     gaze.  Her calm resolve.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Please?  As one human being to
                     another, just because I'm miserable
                     and don't know where to turn.  I
                     need to be in your arms.  If it's
                     just for thirty seconds.

     His pleading look holds her for a moment.  In the silence...

                               HATSUE
                     I hurt for you.  Whether you'll
                     ever believe that or not.

     Feeling behind her eyes.  First time she lets it show.

                               HATSUE
                     I feel sick sometimes, with the
                     guilt of what I've done to you.
                     And I can't make it right.

     She rises slowly.  Brushes the sand from her skirt.

                               HATSUE
                     To hold you would be wrong and
                     deceitful.  You're going to have
                     to live without holding me, that
                     is the truth of the way things are.

     She takes one step back.

                               HATSUE
                     Things end.  They do.  Get on
                     with your life.

     And turns away.  She gathers her baby in her arms.  Takes her
     blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail.  He watches, never
     moving, as she gathers her things.  Gathers them as if he wasn't
     there.  And with her back turned...

                               HATSUE
                     Get on with your life.

     She walks slowly away.  Her baby cries.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a steaming soup kettle, resting on a woodstove.  A woman's
     hand stirs with a wooden ladle.  PULL BACK to see...

     HELEN CHAMBERS, slender and strong and keen.  She is not yet 60.  A
     code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned
     features.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I drove from the lighthouse to
                     my mother's place.  I brought
                     her some groceries.

     Beyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever.  Silent.
     Spellbinding.

                               HELEN
                     Your father thought that heavy snow
                     was God's kindness.  Despite the
                     hardship, it brought us beauty...

     Ishmael at the rustic table.  Watching her back.

                               HELEN
                     ...and reminded us.  Of our place
                     in things.

     Softer.  Not bitter, but regretful that...

                               HELEN
                     You don't believe in God anymore.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve,
                     Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.

     She begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls.

                               HELEN
                     We don't know God, we feel Him.  You
                     felt Him as a child.  I remember.

     And turns.  Looks at him.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's a long time ago.  What a
                     child feels...that's different.

     She studies him silently for a moment.  Then brings the bowls to
     the table...

                               HELEN
                     Spend the night, will you?  Don't
                     go back out into all that snow.

     Sets them down.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I felt Milholland's report in my
                     pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't
                     telling her.  Telling someone.
                     What I'd found.

                               HELEN
                     You've been busy with that trial,
                     I suppose.  Such a travesty...

     She takes her seat.  As he watches her.

                               HELEN
                     They only arrested that poor soul
                     because he's Japanese.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They
                     say the evidence is rock solid.

     She begins to eat.  Eyes on her bowl.

                               HELEN
                     They're not his neighbor, like
                     you are.  He is a husband, a father,
                     he risked his life for their country.
                     The same as you.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Those aren't the facts that matter.

     She looks up.  Straight to his eyes.

                               HELEN
                     Well, folks are pretty cold.
                     And folks who believe in nothing
                     else...they're cold, too.

     No mistaking her meaning.  He swallows.  Uneasy as always, in the
     path of her disapproval.

                               HELEN
                     I've tried to understand your
                     unhappiness, all these years.
                     Having gone to war, losing your arm...

     The directness of her gaze.  He can't turn from that.

                               HELEN
                     But other boys came back.  And
                     pushed on.  They found girls, and
                     married, had babies...

     He doesn't flinch.  His voice too quiet with...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Someday I'll get lucky, too.

     Too quiet to conceal the hurt.  She thinks it is hurt she has
     caused.  It changes her tone to a plea...

                               HELEN
                     Your father fought at Belleau
                     Wood, it took him years to get
                     over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...

                               ISHMAEL
                     ...but he found you.

     Their eyes locked.

                               HELEN
                     It isn't the war, Ishmael.  All
                     those years growing up.  You never
                     had a real girl of your own.

     And now he looks down.  He sees that his fist is tight around the
     handle of his spoon.

                               HELEN
                     And I know you have it in you
                     to love.  I know that much.  I
                     wish I knew more.

     His fingers open, and the spoon clatters softly on the wood.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'll stay tonight.  Thanks
                     for asking.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael wanders through a silent room.  A bed, a dresser.  Work
     table and lamp.  A room denuded of all decoration, all possessions,
     all sign of life.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I came back from the war to
                     this room.  I stayed a few
                     months.  Until my father passed.

     EXT. VETERAN'S CEMETERY - DAY

     Ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned
     at the elbow.  The diggers are filling a grave in distance.
     Mourners mingle, some casting glances back at Ishmael.  Keeping
     their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect.

     One man comes to him.  MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail.  But his
     voice is clear...

                               NAGAISHI
                     The Japanese people of the island
                     are saddened by this loss.  Your
                     father was a man of great fairness
                     and compassion for others...

     He stands at a respectful distance.  Ishmael clears his throat.  He
     nods, thank you.  No words to say.  So the small man adds...

                               NAGAISHI
                     A friend to us.  And to all people.

     Silence.  They are a tableau of stone.  Finally...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well...

     And no more.  The man takes a step back...

                               NAGAISHI
                     We know you will follow in his
                     footsteps.  And honor his legacy.

     Which changes Ishmael's face.  To something harder.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     I thought it then.  And often since.
                     A balance, he's said.  Finding the
                     facts.  That folks needed to know.

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael stands at an open closet.  Cardboard boxes have been set
     aside.  One has been searched for treasure.  The page is in his
     hand.  Only slightly discolored by age.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     Dear Ishmael.  These things are
                     very difficult to say.  I can't
                     think of anything more painful
                     than writing this letter.

     He closes his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     Think of reading it.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     I don't love you, Ishmael.  There
                     is no more honest way to say it.

     He carries the letter to the twin bed.  Where he slept alone.
     Thinking of her.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     Whenever we were together, I knew
                     it.  I loved you and I didn't love
                     you at the same moment.

     He sinks slowly.  As if beneath the letter's weight.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     The last time.  At the cedar tree.
                     I knew we could never be right
                     together.  And that soon I would
                     have to tell you.

     His eyes are dry.  The letter has used up his tears long ago.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     This is the last time I will write
                     to you.  I am not yours anymore.

     He sets the letter on the bed beside him.

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     I wish you the very best.  Your
                     heart is large and you are gentle
                     and kind.  I know you will do great
                     things in the world.

     He reaches now to his inside coat pocket.  Withdrawing...

                               HATSUE (V.O.)
                     I must say good-bye to you now.
                     Our lives will move on.  The best
                     we can.

     ...a page.  Folded in quarters.  Sets it near the letter.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Milholland's report was like her
                     letter.  Something no one else.
                     Would ever read.

     He stares at them.  Side by side.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Thing about having only one hand.
                     It's hard to tear pages up.  And
                     I wasn't carrying a match.

     He lies back.  Across the bed.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     So I thought of my father.  The man
                     who would have taken this report to
                     Judge Fielding.

     Tears stand in his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     But every reporter.  Chooses his own
                     balance.  FInds the facts that matter.

     Shuts the eyes.  Against them.  Against everything.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     After all, the freighter was only
                     a theory.  It proved nothing at
                     all.  There were other facts.
                     That mattered.

     We CLOSE on his face.  The tightness of the muscles.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Tomorrow I would write a column.
                     About prejudice.  And she would
                     be grateful.  For my large...and
                     gentle...heart.

     The eyes open, they are blank.  Staring...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Her husband would be judged.  And
                     she would be alone.

     ...at the future.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Alone.  The past looks different.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     Hatsue Miyamoto in the witness box. Graceful, erect, her porcelain
     beauty accessible, eager to cooperate.  Humble.

                               HATSUE
                     Hopeful.  Is the word I would use.

     And Nels seems slightly surprised.

                               NELS
                     But Carl didn't say yes.

                               HATSUE
                     He didn't say no.  That was Kabuo's
                     point.  Given how Carl's mother
                     felt, Carl was still willing to
                     consider selling to us.  It was a
                     good sign.

     Nels considers that.

                               NELS
                     Well, in the week that followed,
                     the week before Carl's death...
                     did your husband pursue him?

                               HATSUE
                     No.  Kabuo did not wish to beg,
                     he respected Carl's right to
                     reflect.  He was sure Carl would
                     do the honorable thing.

                               NELS (right back)
                     And did he?

     She nods.  Only once.  Her eyes bright.

                               HATSUE
                     The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped
                     Carl at sea.  With his dead battery.

     Nels raises his eyebrows.  To give the point its weight.

                               HATSUE
                     Right there, on the boat, they
                     agreed.  $8400 for the seven acres,
                     $800 down.  They shook on it.  Kabuo
                     was so excited when he came home.

     Nels lets that sit.  And sit.

                               NELS
                     And when did you first learn.
                     That Carl had drowned?

     The slightest pause.  As if hesitant to confess...

                               HATSUE
                     One o'clock, that afternoon, from
                     a clerk at Petersen's.

                               NELS (turning to Hooks)
                     Your witness.

     And Alvin Hooks rises.  Perches on the edge of the prosecutor's
     table.  And looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion.

                               HOOKS
                     Your husband came home agitated,
                     after his encounter with the
                     deceased?

     No impatience across her perfect features.  Only earnestness
     will do.

                               HATSUE
                     I said 'excited'.  Not agitated,
                     he was excited in the sense of
                     being overjoyed.

                               HOOKS
                     You were...overjoyed yourself, to
                     hear the news?

                               HATSUE
                     Happy for him.  And relieved.

                               HOOKS
                     So, then, you...and your husband...
                     must have called friends, relatives,
                     to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?

                               HATSUE (calm, respectful)
                     No.

                               HOOKS
                     Really?  Didn't call your mother,
                     your sisters, about starting a new
                     life.  Your husband never tells
                     his brothers that the family honor
                     is vindicated.

     Hatsue shifts in her chair.  Smooths her skirt.

                               HATSUE
                     We hear how Carl...passed away.
                     Only a few hours later.

                               HOOKS
                     Your husband returned at, what,
                     seven o'clock?

                               HATSUE
                     Closer to eight.

                               HOOKS
                     So, five hours.  Plenty of time for
                     a call.  He was 'excited', you say.
                     In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.

     She nods, he was.

                               HATSUE
                     We are...cautious people.  You
                     would say conservative.  There
                     would be time for celebrating
                     with others when a paper was signed.

     Hooks pouts.  He allows himself that.

                               HOOKS
                     You thought the deceased might...
                     break his promise?

                               HATSUE
                     Of course not.  We're just not
                     quick to run and boast.  In case
                     something went wrong.

                               HOOKS
                     And then, something did.  Carl
                     Heine was found dead.  With his
                     head crushed.

     She weathers that last part.  As if taking no notice.

                               HATSUE
                     Yes, and then, what was there
                     to call about?  Everything was
                     up in the air.

                               HOOKS
                     Up in the air?  Was that your
                     reaction?

     And he rises.  Tastefully indignant.

                               HOOKS
                     I would suggest that more happened
                     than a land sale evaporating.  A
                     man died, Mrs. Miyamoto.  A husband
                     and father of small children had
                     his skull bashed in!

                               HATSUE (quiet dignity)
                     If you mean to imply that we were
                     callous about Carl's death, that is
                     wrong and insulting.

                                HOOKS
                     I see.  Well, did you come
                     forward to tell Sheriff Moran
                     what you knew?  The encounter in
                     the fog, the...dead battery, was it?

     Silence.

                               HATSUE
                     We discussed that.  And decided
                     not to.

                               HOOKS
                     Why not?

     She looks at him with the directness we've seen before.

                               HATSUE
                     Because the facts could be
                     misconstrued as murder.

                               HOOKS
                     But if truth was on your side,
                     whatever were you worried about?

     Her eyes cut to Nels.  He smiles, to blunt the harm she's done by
     looking to him for support.  Her gaze goes down now.  And then...

     ...back up.  Straight to Hooks.

                               HATSUE
                     Trials aren't only about truth,
                     Mr. Hooks.  Even though they
                     should be.  They're about what
                     people believe is true.

                               HOOKS
                     So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.

                               HATSUE
                     We were afraid.  Silence seemed
                     better.  To come forward seemed
                     like a mistake.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, it seems to me...

                               NELS (gently)
                     Objection.  Mr. Hooks can give
                     his view in his summation.

                               HOOKS
                     Doesn't it seem to you, Mrs.
                     Miyamoto, that your mistake was
                     in being deceitful?  Concealing
                     information during the course of
                     a sheriff's investigation.

                               HATSUE
                     It seems human.  To me.

     Oh.  Hooks raises his brows.

                               HOOKS
                     I suppose that you mean this excuses
                     concealing the truth.  Then why
                     ahouls any of us believe you now?

     And in the silence...

                               HOOKS
                     Question withdrawn, you may
                     step down.

                               HATSUE
                     You're implying th...

                               HOOKS
                     I said.  No further questions.

     Anger flashes across her eyes.  Her face colors.  She draws a
     breath...

                               JUDGE
                     That's enough, Mrs. Miyamoto, not
                     another word.  Step down, please.

     She looks to Nels in her desperation and regret for making things
     worse.  he chuckles and waves.  It's quite all right.  She sits for
     a frozen moment.  And as she rises...

     The boys in the reporter's row are scribbling furiously.

     All but one.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     JOSIAH GILLANDERS folds his blunt, thick hands across his belly.
     Nearly 50, sporting a walrus moustache and the watery, dull eyes of
     an alcoholic, he is a man ready to make the most of his fifteen
     minutes of fame.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Thirty years fishing alone.  Ever
                     had an occasion to board another
                     man's boat except in an emergency?
                     Maybe to socialize or some such?

                               GILLANDERS (ready for this)
                     Never.  Only boarded some fella's boat
                     five, six times in thirty-one years.
                     Dead engine, broken hip, only in need.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Now, Mister Gi...

                               GILLANDERS
                     Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't
                     bother each other, stick to ourselves.
                     Ask anybody.

     Nels is wandering over to the jury box.

                               NELS
                     Now if you wanted to kill a man.
                     Think you'd try boarding against
                     his will, and hitting him with a
                     fishing gaff?

                               GILLANDERS
                     It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's
                     boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come
                     aboard?  All against Carl's will?
                     It's the stupidest suggestion I
                     ever heard of.

                               NELS
                     I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't
                     mine in the first place.

     Gentle laughter.  Even some on the jury.

                               NELS
                     So the fishing gaff method wouldn't
                     make sense?

                               GILLANDERS
                     Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd
                     just shoot the feller.  Then tie
                     up, throw him inta th' drink.  And
                     skip bein' the first gill-netter
                     in history to make a successful
                     forced boarding.

     More laughter.  Hooks at his table.  Simply smiles.

                     D-6 battery in Carl's well was

                     No sense to have any at all.,
                     even the right size.  It's like

                     Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto
                     there gave him one a his.

                               NELS
                     Course, if Carl lost both batteries,
                     dead in the water, his radio wouldn't
                     work.  So how would he signal for help?

                               GILLANDERS
                     Compressed air horn, most likely.

                               NELS
                     All right, what if the defendant
                     heard?  So Carl let him aboard, to

                     in advance?  That Carl loses two
                     batteries.  Must happen once ever'

                     you for coming down, in this cold

                     Well, it does seem mighty warm in
                     here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.

     And looks at the prosecutor.  Who rises, easily.  A most polite
     fuck-you smile.  Hooks strolls now.  Slow and steady.  Straight to
     the witness box.  Rests his hands on the rail.  Leans in.

                     What if the defendant follows Carl.
                     And pretends his own batteries are
                     dead?  Would Carl tie up and help?

     And the smile on Gillander's face.  Stops.  Cold.

                     a spare, after all.  Or maybe the
                     defendant left it, as a potential

     Gillanders.  Actually thinking about that.

                               HOOKS
                     My question is.  Could Carl have
                     tied up to help the defendant?

     A beat.  A cleared throat.

                               GILLANDERS
                     It coulda happened.  And if I start
                     to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y
                     say 'no further questions', right?

     Once more, laughter.  Enough to bring the gavel DOWN.

                               HOOKS
                     Right about that.  And right that
                     it 'coulda happened'.

     Turns his back, walks away.

                               HOOKS
                     Thanks for your help.  Hope the
                     witness box wasn't too warm for
                     your comfort.

     All eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits.  Except for the

     INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT

     Kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell, leaning back
     against the wall.  Leaving the cot.  For his guest.

                     But the toughest scenario.  Is the

     Kabuo watching.  Quiet.  Takes a breath...

                               KABUO
                     And what's that?

                               NELS
                     That you came upon Carl by accident.

                     seven acres.  Like you said.

     The hardest.  Straightest.  Look.

                     Only.  He said no.

                     And something...happened.  That
                     you'd never planned.  Because
                     you're not a cold-blooded killer.

     Nobody flinches.  Nobody blinks.

                               KABUO
                     I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh?
                     Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.

                               NELS
                     You won't hear that from Hooks.
                     Because the charge is first-degree
                     murder, which requires premeditation.
                     He can't change the charge.

     Do you understand?

                     So if the jury thinks you did kill.

                               KABUO
                     You want me to say that.

                               NELS

                               KABUO
                     And what do you believe?

     Nels sighs.  Cocks his head just to one side.

                               NELS
                     A question first.  Why do you want
                     to know?

                               KABUO (straight back)
                     Because you're my friend.

     The old man thinks about that.  Studies his client.

                               NELS
                     I believe you are a good man.  Who
                     belongs with his family.

     And then the feeling comes.  To the watery eyes.

                               NELS
                     And I believe.  You didn't do it.

     EXT. SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT

     Fog.  The sound of water.  Lapping at the hull of a boat.  The mist
     drfits, revealing...

     Eyes.  They are blue.  The heavy brows above them dark gold, matted
     and damp.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     My batteries are drawed down, both
                     of 'em.  ALternator belts were loose.

     PULL BACK to see him.  With his keroses lantern and his air horn.

                               KABUO (O.S.)
                     No sweat.  We'll pull one a mine,
                     get ya started.

     PULL BACK to see him now, leaning on his gaff.  Squinting up.  At
     the top of Carl's mast.  We follow his gaze to see...

                               KABUO (O.S.)
                     You lashed up a lantern?  'Gainst
                     a fog like this?

     See it now.  SWAYING as the helpless boat bobs in the night.

                               CARL (O.S.)
                     Lantern and a air horn.  That's
                     all I got, without my juice.

     INT. CARL'S CABIN - LATER

     CLOSE on a battery well.  One battery sits in place, one spot is
     empty.  And...

     ...CRASH!  The butt end of a fishing gaff BANGS against the metal
     flange.  Again.  Again.  AGAIN.  And as the next blow is STRUCK,
     the huge hand...

     ...slips, and the soft metal SLICES Carl's flesh across his palm.
     He stops.  Then SMASHES away, twice more.  We PULL BACK to see...

     ...two batteries lie above the well.  Carl sucks the blood from his
     cut.  Then lifts Kabuo's D-6 into place...

                               CARL
                     Don't know how long it's take to
                     get a charge...

                               KABUO
                     Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish.
                     I'll see ya back on the docks...

     Kabuo takes his gaff.  Heedless of Carl's blood on the butt end.
     Carl looks up, still crouching above his well.

                               CARL (quietly)
                     Hold on.  You know as well as
                     I do, we got somethin' to talk
                     about.

     No response from Kabuo.  He stands above the larger man.  Silent,
     neutral.  Waiting.

                               CARL
                     Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what
                     you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious,
                     is all.

                               KABUO
                     What are you sellin' 'em for?
                     Why don't we start there.

     Which makes the big man smile.  Just a little.

                               CARL
                     Did I say I was selling?  But
                     if I was, I'd have to figure you
                     want 'em real bad.  Oughta charge
                     a sall fortune, maybe...

     A slight shrug.  Of giant shoulders.

                               CARL
                     Then again.  Maybe you'd want
                     your battery back.

     Kabuo doesn't grin back.  His face shows nothing at all.

                               KABUO
                     The battery's in, that's done
                     with.  Besides, you'd do the
                     same for m...

                               CARL
                     ...might do the same.  I have to
                     warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm
                     not screwed together like I used
                     to be.

     Kabuo's face remains impassive.  Patient.  And the big man squints
     up into it.  Holding a handkerchief to his injured hand.

                               CARL
                     Hell, I'm sorry, okay?  About
                     the whole damn mess.  If I'd a
                     been around, my mother wouldn't
                     a pulled it off that way.

     He is sorry.  And with that, Kabuo's face eases.  Becomes like
     Carl's own.

                               CARL (grins)
                     I was out there at sea.  Fightin'
                     you Jap sons-a-bitches.

                               KABUO (no grin)
                     I'm an American.  Did I call you
                     a Nazi, you big Nazi bastard?

                               CARL (softly)
                     Not that I recall.

                               KABUO
                     I killed men who looked just like
                     you, pig-fed German bastards.  And
                     their blood don't wash off so easy.

     Still no smile.  Carl staring up.

                               KABUO
                     So don't talk to me about Japs,
                     you big Nazi son of a bitch.

     Carl laughs.  And Kabuo chuckles, right along with him.  Having
     kept his poker face the longer.

                               CARL
                     I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun
                     Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still
                     got your bamboo fishing rod.

                               KABUO
                     Oh, yeh?

                               CARL
                     Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess
                     a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in
                     my closet.

                               KABUO (very softly)
                     You can have it.  The hell with it.

     The look between them now.  Is very wonderful.  In the subtlety of
     its connection.

                               CARL
                     $1200 an acre, that's what I paid
                     Ole, won't take a dime less.  You
                     got no choice on that.

                               KABUO
                     Didn't say I was buyin' did I?
                     What you want down?  Just bein'
                     curious, is all.

     The handkerchief comes away from Carl's palm.  And rising, his hand
     extends toward the smaller man.

                               CARL
                     A thousand down.  We'll sign
                     papers t'morrow.

     The hands grip.  And they hold.  And the length of this clasp, and
     the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment.
     Wash years away.

                               KABUO
                     Eight hundred.  And it's a deal.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on eyes.  They are Asian.  Unblinking.

                               HOOKS (O.S.)
                     For the life of me, sir, I cannot
                     imagine why you kept this story from
                     the sheriff.

     PULL BACK to see Kabuo in the witness box.  Ramrod straight.  Face
     composed.

                               KABUO
                     As my wife testified, we were
                     considering it.

                               HOOKS
                     Actually, she said you had decided.
                     Decided not not come forward.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     I was thinking about it.  Every
                     minute.

                               HOOKS
                     Except even when Sheriff Moran
                     arrested you.  You said nothing
                     about seeing Carl.

     Turns to the jury.  Openly bewildered.

                               HOOKS
                     At that point, you were already
                     under suspicion.  The battery story
                     explained things.  If the story was
                     true...and not simply something you
                     thought up later...

     Turns back.  To the defendant.

                               HOOKS
                     Why.  Didn't you.  Tell it?

     No reaction from the defendant.  Nothing anyone can see.

                               KABUO
                     Sheriff said right off, I was
                     under suspicion.  I didn't have
                     a lawyer...

                               HOOKS
                     But even after you had an
                     attorney.  You still claimed to
                     know nothing.  Claimed not to
                     have seen Carl. Am I correct?

     A beat.

                               KABUO
                     Yes.  Initially.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, 'initially' is an interesting
                     word, sir.  You'd been arrested,
                     you had a lawyer, and you still
                     claimed ignorance!

     Silence.

                               KABUO
                     I should have told everything
                     right away.  I know that now,
                     and I regret it.

                               HOOKS
                     Should have told 'everything'.
                     Meaning, you should have told
                     the truth.

     We can just discern the anger.  At the edge of Kabuo's steady gaze.
     Silence.

                               HOOKS
                     Nothing to say?

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     I didn't know that was a question.
                     It sounded like a speech.

     And Hooks smiles.  Loving it.  Walks toward the witness, stalking
     him.

                               HOOKS
                     My apologies.  Do you regret
                     not telling the truth?

                               KABUO
                     I have told the truth.

                               HOOKS
                     You mean, this morning.  The
                     new story, the battery story.
                     That one is the truth?  That's
                     a question, sir.

                               KABUO (even quieter)
                     Yes.  And I told it long before
                     this morning.

                               HOOKS
                     I see.  Now what happened the
                     day Carl Heine was found?  Before
                     your arrest.

                               KABUO
                     I slept til one-thirty, when my
                     wife woke me up with the news.  We
                     talked for a few hours.  I left at
                     six and went straight to my boat.

                               HOOKS
                     Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands,
                     no purchases?  Just straight to the
                     boat.  That's the truth.

                               KABUO
                     Yes.

     Hooks leans over the box.  Ever so slightly invading Kabuo's space.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, the sheriff found two batteries
                     in your well.  If you left one with
                     Carl Heine, how is that possible?

                               KABUO
                     I had a spare battery in my shed.
                     I brought it down, and put it in
                     just before the sheriff showed up.

     Ah.  I see.

                               HOOKS
                     Conveniently, in your shed.  Only
                     you didn't mention that a moment ago.
                     Why does this battery story change
                     every time a new question is raised?

     Kabuo looks at him, evenly.

                               KABUO
                     You asked if I went straight to the
                     boat.  I did.  With the battery.

     Hooks steps back.  Looks the witness over.

                               HOOKS
                     You're a hard man to trust, sir.
                     You sit before us, with no expression,
                     keeping a poker f...

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Objection!

                               JUDGE
                     You know better than that, Mr.
                     Hooks.  Either ask questions
                     that count for something, or sit
                     down and be done with it.

     Silence.  The judge staring hard.  Hooks never flinching.

                               JUDGE
                     Shame on you.

     Hooks turns his eyes to Kabuo.  Stares him down, so the jury can
     watch Kabuo's implacable stare in return.  And softly...

                               HOOKS
                     I apologize to the court, for
                     letting my feelings get the
                     better of me.

     Turns away.

                               HOOKS
                     No other questions.  We'll go to
                     summation.

     As he returns to his table.  As Kabuo steps down from the box.
     We PAN...

     ...reporters' row.  The boys are writing as fast as their hands can
     move.  Only Ishmael is not writing at all.  He stares at the pad
     resting on hsi right knee.  We CLOSE to see...

     One word circled.  The word 'lantern'.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Alvin Hooks stalks the jury box now.  Prowls before them along the
     rail.  As their eyes follow.

                               HOOKS
                     ...believing that Etta Heine's son
                     would never sell him the land.  Land
                     that in his mind, filtered through
                     ancient rules of behavior handed down
                     from his ancestors' culture, belonged
                     to his family by right...

     Stops.  To make sure they understand.

                               HOOKS
                     His only choice to get the land
                     would be to eliminate Carl Heine.
                     So that Ole Jurgensen would need
                     a new buyer.

     Pacing again, hand trailing along the rail...

                               HOOKS
                     In his mind.  Seen through codes
                     of revenge difficult for us to
                     fathom, this was also the only way
                     to avenge what he felt to be the
                     grievous dishonor brought to his
                     father, his family...

     Raises his finger.  This must be heard...

                               HOOKS
                     ...to a thousand years of ancestry,
                     in a foreign land we still find an
                     enigma.  Despite our recent bitter
                     experience with its ways.

     And stops once more.  Places his hands on the rail.

                               HOOKS
                     Thus believing cold-blooded murder to
                     be justified...he trailed Carl Heine...
                     could hear his engine in the fog...and
                     sounded his own horn, claiming distress.

     Straightens up.  Shakes his head, ever so slightly.

                               HOOKS
                     As Carl pulled alongside: 'Please,
                     Carl,' the defendant must have said.
                     'I am sorry for what has come between
                     us, but adrift here in the fog, I
                     plead for your help!'

     Imagine.  Imagine that.

                               HOOKS
                     And so this good man tied his
                     boat fast, while his enemy leaps
                     aboard, striking the treacherous
                     blow he was trained to strike by
                     his father's hand.

     Counting off the facts.  One finger at a time.

                               HOOKS
                     The feud over these seven acres
                     had festered for eight years.  He
                     argued with Carl about buying the
                     land one week before Carl was killed.
                     Carl's skull was crushed, and his
                     blood is on a murder weapon with which
                     the defendant is a deadly expert!

     Spreads his arms.  Wide.

                               HOOKS
                     And after a series of lies.  The
                     defendant at last admits he was
                     there.  Alone on the boat.  In
                     the fog.  Carl Heine's blood on
                     his fishing gaff.

     A hush.  A murmur...

                               HOOKS
                     My lord.  My lord.

     Looking into the eyes now.  Of each man.  Each woman.

                               HOOKS
                     Look clearly at the defendant.
                     See the truth self-evident in him.
                     And in the facts of this case.

     And turns.  So that they will follow his eyes to Kabuo's stone-
     hard gaze.

                               HOOKS
                     Look into his eyes, ladies and
                     gentlemen, consider his face.
                     And ask yourself what your duty
                     is as citizens of this community.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     PAN the jury, slowly, as they hear...

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     ...not a single witness has testified
                     to anything that could suggest pre-
                     meditated murder.  Not in the days
                     before Carl Heine's death...or at
                     any time...has anyone described a
                     murderous rage toward the deceased.

     Nels stands very still.  Hands resting on the rail.  As calm and
     quiet as his adversary had been dramatic.

                               NELS
                     Etta Heine had cheated his family.
                     He had asked his childhood friend
                     Carl to sell him the land.  And
                     Carl was considering it.

     Leans forward.  Just a little.

                               NELS
                     There is no evidence of anger at
                     Carl, much less rage, much less
                     murderous rage.  No reason for
                     premeditation and no evidence of
                     it.  Anywhere.

     He picks out a housewife.  The youngest.  Smiles sadly, wisely.  As
     her grandfather might.

                               NELS
                     And yet the state is required to
                     prove these things.  Beyond.  A
                     reasonable.  Doubt.

     His eyes widen.

                               NELS
                     Can you seriously think there is
                     no reasonable doubt?  Why is Kabuo's
                     D-6 battery in Carl's well, if Carl
                     was helping him?

     Why?

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     CLOSE on handcuffs SNAPPING into place.  Sheriff Moran checks their
     snugness about Kabuo's wrists, as the crowd mills through the
     courtroom in the wake of adjournment.  Grasping Kabuo's arm, Moran
     begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the
     witness box.  But...

     ...someone is there.  In the doorway.  And Moran's grip tightens as
     they approach...

                               MORAN
                     I'm awful sorry, Ma'am, but you
                     know I c...

                               HATSUE
                     What are you afraid of, Sheriff?

     The edge on that, the ballsy undertone, throws him a little.

                               HATSUE
                     Am I going to slip him a weapon
                     for a mad escape?  Perhaps a kendo
                     staff hidden in my dress?

                               MORAN
                     There's rules.

                               HATSUE
                     Well, please break them, then.
                     I won't keep you a moment.

     And she reaches past him.  To take her husband's hands.  She looks
     in his eyes, as if they are alone.

                               HATSUE
                     I love you.  And tomorrow, when
                     I make our bed.  I'm setting out
                     your pillow.

     Tears just flood her eyes.  Sudden, unbidden.  She holds tight to
     her smile.  And to his hands.

                               HATSUE (whispers)
                     You better be there.

     He smiles.  A lovely, easy, cowboy-American smile.

                               KABUO
                     Only if you ask me nice.

     ANGLE...from the gallery.  One man watches.  Watches as a woman
     brings manicled hands to her lips.  And walks quickly away...

     ...toward us.  Straight toward us, in fact.  And when she stands
     before us, her hands mangle her purse.  The eyes are hollow, flint-
     edged.

                     It's not for the.  They only
                     get to convict him.

     She arches her throat.  As if facing a firing squad.

                               HATSUE
                     It's the judge who decides.  If
                     he'll hang.

     He reaches.  His fingertips find her shoulder.  She does not resist
     his touch.

                               ISHMAEL (gently)
                     None of that is gonna ha...

                     You don't think he did this.

     His hand comes away.  From his heart...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I know he didn't.

     She nods.  Nods.  Her eyes filling.  Moving over his face.

                               HATSUE
                     Come to supper, tonight.  My
                     mother would be proud to have
                     you with us.

     He hears the emotion in her voice.  He swallows hard.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I can't.

     No, I can't.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Tell your mom.  I want a rain check.

     INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT

     Kabuo sits on the cot, the way we have always seen him.  Alone in
     his mind.  Footfalls.  Kabuo oblivious, far away.  The door CLANGS
     open.

                               MORAN
                     You have a visitor, son.

     Turns to the visitor...

                               MORAN
                     You said three minutes.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Won't take two.

     And Moran leaves.  The door CLANGS shut.  They are alone.  Only one
     man smiling...

                               KABUO
                     Please, sit down...

     But the tall man doesn't.  Doesn't move.

                               KABUO
                     She told me you're writing a
                     column.  We're very grateful.

     Ishmael nods, awkwardly.  Acknowledging this.

                               KABUO
                     She.  Said you two go way back...

     Ishmael stares into Kabuo's earnest smile.

                               KABUO
                     That's nice.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You said there was a lantern
                     in his hand.  When you found
                     him in the fog.

     Kabuo blinks.  The man's tone is formal.  As if the offer of
     friendliness is somehow rejected.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And another one.  Lashed to
                     the mast?

     Kabuo's own smile has faded.  The mask has returned.

                               KABUO
                     That's right.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Two.  Lanterns.

     And Kabuo grins.  In spite of himself.

                               KABUO
                     If I did the math right.

     Ishmael leans back.  Against the door.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's the sheriff's math.  I'm
                     wondering about.

     INT. SOMMENSEN'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Blackness.  The sound of wind.  Of water lapping at wood.  CLICK of
     a key, springing a lock.  The SCRAPE of a large PADLOCK sliding
     away.  A door CREAKS open, and from the sound of it, a large one.

     Gray light seeps in.

                               MORAN (O.S.)
                     Blackmail.  That's all it is.

     See them now.  Three SILHOUETTES framed in thr barn's open doorway.
     Against the night sky.

                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)
                     I call it keeping your promise.
                     We said if I ever needed some
                     cooperation from you...

     A soft CLICK, and the LIGHTS go on.  Such as they are.  A few
     bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle
     enclosure.  A 50-year-old mildewed barn, built of creosoted
     timbers.  This is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors
     facing the harbor.

     Two BOATS are tied to wide-elbowed piers.  We've seen them before.

                               MORAN
                     You threatened me, Chambers, pure
                     and simple.  And what idiot's gonna
                     believe some cock and bull story
                     that I made a deal to keep stuff
                     outta your paper?  Not that anybody
                     reads your paper.

     Abel Martenson leads the way.  Along soaking planks.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Same idiots who'll believe you
                     cracked this case.  When I tell
                     'em you did.

     Moran snorts.  Points up to the cross spar, high on the mast of the
     first boat.

                               MORAN
                     See, no lantern.

                               ABEL (respectfully)
                     Sheriff?  That's Miyamoto's boat.

     Oh.  Moran swings his gaze up to the second boat.

                               MORAN (quiet triumph)
                     No lantern there, neither.

     Sure enough.  No lantern on the cross spar.  They keep walking.

                               MORAN
                     Never shoulda given you that
                     inventory in the first place.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's public record.  If the public
                     cares enough to read it.

     They step across the gunnel.  Onto Carl Heine's boat.  Flashlights
     working against the dim, eerie glow of distant bulbs, they enter
     Carl's cabin.

     Neat as a pin.  Ishmael scans the floor.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You said there was a coffee c...

                               ABEL (sorry)
                     I picked it up.

     And points to the cup.  Sitting on the counter.

                               ABEL
                     It's the only thing I moved, I
                     swear.  It was right there.

     The sheriff glares at the boy.

                               MORAN
                     You wanna see that in the papers?
                     Don't ever touch something at a cri...

     And stops.  Because Ishmael's gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern.
     In the corner.

                               MORAN
                     One lantern.  Like the inventory
                     says.  Sorry to disappoint you.

     But Ishmael is out the door.  Shining his flashlight.  Up the mast.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Actually.  I was hoping you got
                     it right.  What's that, up there?

     And they all squint up.  Shining their lights together.  Along the
     cross spar.

                               MORAN
                     Nothin'.  Bits of string.

     That's what it looks like.  Many of them.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Pieces of twine aren't nothing.

     And he steps to the base of the mast.  Puts the flashlight in his
     pocket.  Wraps his arm around the shaft of wood.

                               MORAN
                     Here now, what are you fixin'
                     to do?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Have a look.  At nothing.

     And wrapping his legs around the mast, he hoists himself up.

                               MORAN
                     You can't go up there, touch things...

     With all his strength.  Ishmael begins to climb.

                               ISHMAEL (grunting)
                     Trial's over, Sheriff, it's with
                     the jury now.

     Supporting himself with his legs, he struggles upward.

                               MORAN
                     You gonna climb that with one arm?

                               ISHMAEL
                     You're right.  I better use two.

     Up he goes, inching his way, Abel shining his flashlight.  Moran
     swings his beam up, too.

                               ABEL
                     There's lots of 'em, Art, look.

     And Moran is looking.  Saying nothing.  Now, Ishmael is there.

                               ISHMAEL
                     A dozen or more, all figure eights.
                     All cut clean through on an angle.

                               ABEL
                     And look at that streak of rust,
                     across the mast.

     His light playing on it.  Bracing his full weight with his legs,
     Ishmael fingers the scraps of rope...

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's on the twine, too.  But it's
                     not r...

                               MORAN
                     Don't prove there was two lanterns.
                     Coulda been the one in the cabin.

     Still supporting  himself with his legs, Ishmael pulls out his
     flashlight...

                               ISHMAEL
                     There's a stretch of ground
                     between guessin' and provin',
                     Sheriff.  I'll give you that.

     ...shines it DOWN on the deck.  Along the gunnel.  Just below the
     mast.  And as we watch the circle of light move...

                               MORAN (O.S.)
                     What do you think you're lookin'
                     at now?

     Still moving.  And in the silence, an absent...

                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)
                     Not what I'm looking at.  It's
                     what I'm looking for.

     INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT

     Eleven citizens around a walnut table.  Eleven.  Glaring at the
     twelfth.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     Well.  I guess it comes down to
                     a feeling, don't it?  If I feel
                     uncertain, I feel a doubt.  Isn't
                     that it?

     And the boat builder smiles amicably, rubs his gray beard.  No
     other smiles.  Anywhere.

                               HAROLD JENSEN
                     Alex, nobody ain't ever sure about
                     nothin'.  It's unreasonable to be so
                     stubborn that you think you're smarter
                     than eleven folks who all agree!

                               EDITH TWARDZIK
                     The man sat there and admitted he
                     lied, Mr. Van Ness.  Now why isn't
                     that enough for you?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     We're not tryin' him for lying.  Lots
                     of us told lies, one time or another.
                     Prob'ly none of us murdered anybody.

                               HAROLD JENSEN
                     But what drives a man to lie?
                     Means he's hiding somethin'.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     Not necessarily that he killed
                     Carl.  I'm not sayin' you're wrong,
                     just that I have my doubts.

                               BURKE LATHAM
                     Look, if you changed chairs right
                     now, cos you doubted that maybe a
                     chunk of the moon was gonna fall
                     through the roof, that wouldn't be
                     a reasonable doubt.

     Folks turn to Burke.  What the hell are you talking about?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS (laughs)
                     Okay, you win that one.  Now can
                     we all go to bed?

                               HARLAN McQUEEN
                     The mooring line.  Doesn't that
                     tell you something?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     I think it does.  Miyamoto was on
                     Carl's boat, or vice-versa.  Not
                     much doubt about th...

                               MARLAN McQUEEN
                     And Carl's blood on the gaff?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     There's a chance it came from his
                     hand.

                               BURKE LATHAM
                     There's a chance of everything.
                     But you add a chance from here and
                     a chance from there, the world ain't
                     made a coincidences only.

     Everyone agrees.  Almost everyone.

                               EDITH TWARDZIK
                     Look, if he gave Carl a battery
                     like he said, he'd only a had one
                     left.  Not two.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     He explained that.  He replaced it.

                               HARLAN McQUEEN
                     Only he threw that part in when he
                     got cornered.  But first time around,
                     he never mentioned it.

                               ROGER PORTER
                     Alex, stop arguin' just to argue.
                     You can see what really happened,
                     same as us.  Isn't that what we're
                     supposed to do is tell the actual
                     truth?  My God, Carl died, here.

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
                     So I don't care Carl died, unless
                     I'm ready to reach for the hangman's
                     rope?  You oughta stop tryin' to
                     bully me into hurrying.

     Little anger in that.  It brings a silence.

                               BURKE LATHAM
                     Been six hours.  You sayin' there's
                     a way to go slower?

     INT. NELS' KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

     Nels in a ratty, frayed old robe, pouring hot water from a kettle
     into mismatched cups.  His hair is wispy and wild, his eyes puffy.
     He COUGHS horrible.  CLEARS his throat...

                               NELS
                     Well.  It's imaginative...

     And drops tea bags into the cups with a splash.

                               NELS
                     ...I'll give you that.

     Lisps over to the cluttered table.  Where his guest is waiting.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's the way it happened, I know
                     it is.

                               NELS
                     No, you don't.

     Nels sits.  Slowly.  Ishmael removes his bag.  Sips his tea.

                               NELS
                     That report.  About the freighter?
                     You didn't find that tonight, did you?

     No answer.  Ishmael keeps sipping.  Holding eye contact.

                               NELS
                     You went right to the cell.  Then
                     to the boat.  Then here.  How long
                     did you know about the freighter?

                               ISHMAEL (just above a whisper)
                     One day.

     Nels' turn.  To sip his tea.

                               NELS
                     This tastes horrible, hmmn?

                               ISHMAEL
                     You're wondering why I held it.

                               NELS
                     I'm wondering how the judge is
                     gonna like my waking up his old
                     bones.  in the middle of the night.

     And he smiles.  A wonderful smile.

                               NELS
                     Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Yes, he was.

     Another sip.

                               NELS
                     He's looking down.  And he's not
                     thinking 'bout the man you were
                     yesterday.  He's proud of the man
                     you are tonight.  That's what counts.

                               ISHMAEL
                     To my father.  Everything counts.

     Nels watches the pain in that.

                               NELS
                     What if I told you he once said
                     to me...don't matter the road we
                     take.  Just so we get there.

                               ISHMAEL (smiles)
                     Then you'd be lying.

                               NELS
                     Doesn't make me wrong.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     The jury once more in the jury box.  PAN their faces.  The faces we
     saw last night.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     All right, let's say that twine
                     had been there to lash a lantern.
                     That it had come from the shuttle of
                     twine found in the deceased's pocket.

     Edith Twardzik.  Burke Latham.  Alexander Van Ness.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Now to re-open a trial that had
                     gone to jury...new evidence should
                     be pretty important.

     See Ishmael.  Quiet, intense.  On the witness stand.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     Tell us why that lantern would be
                     so significant.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Well.  It shows the prosecutor was
                     wrong.  It was Carl's boat that was
                     dead in the water.  Or he'd never
                     have put up the lantern.

     Nels thinks about that.  So the jury will, too.

                               NELS
                     Now you believe there were two
                     lanterns when defendant arrived.
                     One in Carl's hand.  The second
                     lashed to the mast.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported,
                     and he'd have no reason to lie.
                     He couldn't know that it would help
                     his case.

                               NELS
                     Well, why does it?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Because the second lantern, the one
                     on the mast.  Was never found.  So
                     we have to ask...

     A slight shurg.  Stating the obvious.

                               ISHMAEL
                     ...where did it go?

     And then...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe it went.  Where Carl went.
                     Over the side.

                               HOOKS
                     Objection!  Speculation.

     Nels smiles his grandfather smile.

                               NELS
                     Your Honor, all of this is
                     speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks'
                     dramaturgy about the defendant
                     issuing a false distress call.

                               HOOKS
                     Tht was summation, Your H...

                               JUDGE (gently)
                     Overruled, Alvin.  Let's hear
                     this, hmmn?

     Nels Gudmundsson nods to himself.  Takes a stroll over to the jury
     box.  No limp today.  Something has put some spring in his step.

                               NELS
                     So how does this fit with what
                     you told us at the start?  The
                     freighter that plowed through
                     Ship Channel Bank...

     And turns.  Leaning his scrawny butt against the jury's rail.
     He'll watch this with them now.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's when he fell.

                               NELS
                     Fell.

     Ishmael settles in.  Here we go.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Miyamoto gave him the battery, and
                     left.  Carl's boat was running, he
                     goes back to fishing.  But at some
                     point, he thinks of the lantern...

                               NELS
                     Still lashed to the mast.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He figures a perfectly good
                     lantern could get banged around
                     up there.  So he climbs up.  To
                     cut it down.

                               NELS
                     Just as the freighter comes through?
                     Isn't that quite a coincidence?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Coincidences happen.  You run a
                     yellow light just as a car comes
                     out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy
                     happens every day.  Or maybe...

                               NELS
                     Maybe...?

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe Carl picks up something about
                     the freighter on his radio, which is
                     now working.  Same report Milholland
                     heard.  And that makes him get the
                     lantern fast.  Before the freighter's
                     wake can bang it around.

                               NELS
                     But you could be wrong.  He could
                     have climbed up earlier.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Then where's the lantern?  And
                     where's the knife?

                               NELS
                     The knife.  What knife?

     As if he really has forgotten.  As if he wants to know.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Coroner found an empty knife sheath
                     on Carl's belt.  But they never
                     found the knife.

     He's nodding.  Yes, that's right.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He climbs up.  His hand wound still
                     bleeding.  That's the blood I found
                     on the mast.  And the twine.

     Nels' eyes are rapt.  His mouth is shut.  No way he interrupts this
     roll.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He cuts the lantern free, the
                     freighter's wake hits, the boat
                     rolls hard, his bloody hand slips.
                     tracing blood along the mast...

     A hush.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He falls.  The lantern, the knife,
                     go into the water.  Same as Carl.

     The words hang there.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And inside the cabin, a coffee
                     cup falls off the counter.

     Shakes his head.

                               ISHMAEL
                     But there's no one around.  To
                     pick it up.

     Nels ponders.  Puts his hand to his chin.

                               NELS
                     Still a coincidence.  Timing
                     and all.

                               ISHMAEL
                     The freighter started through
                     at 1:42.  The sea water seeped
                     into Carl's watch and stopped it.
                     At 1:47.

     CUT to the defendant.  Ramrod straight, nothing revealed in his
     face.  And to his wife.  Elegant, erect.  Her eyes flooded with
     tears.

                               NELS
                     Still and all.  Carl was a strong
                     swimmer, he m...

                               ISHMAEL
                     He hit his head.  On the way in.

     Silence.

                               NELS
                     You think so?

                               ISHMAEL
                     The sheriff and the deputy and I
                     inspected the deck closely.  We
                     found a small fracture in the wood
                     of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.

                               NELS
                     Well, anything coulda caused that.

     Ishmael nods.  No smile at all.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Anything.  That had a blond hair.

     And Nels is walking now.  Toward the prosecutor's table.  Pulling a
     small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket.

                               NELS
                     Request introduction of Exhibit 18.
                     One single blond hair.  Which Sheriff
                     Moran dug out of that fracture.  Below
                     the mast.  Of Carl Heine's boat.

     Lays the bag on the table.  Just in front of Hooks.  Turns to the
     judge.

                               NELS
                     We will call Sheriff Moran, who
                     will confirm this.  And Coroner
                     Whaley to testify that the damage
                     to the gunnel is of a size and
                     nature not inconsistent with the
                     deceased's skull fracture...

     Turns to the prosecutor...

                               NELS
                     But for now.  Your witness...

     And just strolls on over to his seat.  Looks in his client's eyes.
     How 'bout them apples?  Kabuo loves this old guy.  And right here,
     he lets a little of that show.

     Across the way, the prosector is rising.  He smiles.  Friendly,
     almost amused.

                               HOOKS
                     I have to start reading your
                     paper more closely.  You're quite
                     a storyteller.

                               ISHMAEL (straight back)
                     Thank you.  Coming from the man who
                     wrote, 'But here, adrift in the fog,
                     I plead for your help'...that's quite
                     a compliment.

     There is a ripple of laughter.  But no smile on Ishmael's features.
     His game face is on.  Come and get me, sucker.  And Hooks does
     come, one step at a time.  Straight to the box.

                               HOOKS
                     Everything had to happen just
                     right.  For your little story to
                     fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be
                     on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry, was there a question
                     in there?

     No love lost.  And no pretense about it.  Hatsue Miyamoto sits with
     her hand in her mother's.  Watching these men battle for her
     husband's life.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, the freighter.  The twine.
                     The blood.  The knife.  The cup.
                     The watch.  The second battery.
                     The phantom lantern.  The fishing
                     gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The
                     skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's
                     eleven things...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Twelve.

     Hooks smiles.

                               HOOKS
                     I stand corrected, sir.  And you
                     have a neat explanation for every
                     one of them.

     Hooks nods.  Yes, you do.

                               HOOKS
                     And since you confess this is
                     all pure guesswork.  What is your
                     expertise, sir, are you a detective
                     of sorts?

                               ISHMAEL
                     My expertise.  Is that I'm a
                     journalist.

     Right at his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And journalism.  Is balance.  Finding
                     the facts folks need to know.

     The words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot
     fully appreciate.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Then putting them together.  So
                     truth is revealed.

                               HOOKS
                     But isn't the truth that there are
                     several other ways to explain each
                     of these twelve pieces.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Oh, yes.

     And the prosecutor stops.  Confused for an instant by this
     confession.  Until...

                               ISHMAEL
                     But no other way.  To explain
                     them all.

     A heart-stopping hush.  As everyone, as Hooks himself, sees the
     cehckmate.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And since they all happened.
                     This is the only explanation
                     that's the truth.

     The prosecutor looks like he's been slapped.  Like every act of
     will is necessary to maintain composure.  To find the easy,
     untroubled smile.

                               HOOKS
                     Your line of work.  You must meet
                     a lot of men play fast and loose
                     with the truth.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Like you couldn't believe.

     Service returned.  Hooks leans in.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, the defendant is a liar.
                     He's confessed that much.  And his
                     explanation is...he was afraid.

     And leans in some more.

                               HOOKS
                     Afraid that the good folks of
                     this jury.  Would be too stupid
                     to understand.  Too prejudiced
                     to be fair.

     Shakes his head.

                               HOOKS
                     You buy that?

                               ISHMAEL (gently)
                     I think he was greedy.

     And once more.  The prosecutor can only blink.  Can only move
     toward the trap.

                               HOOKS
                     Greedy.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He didn't want to lose any more.

     No smile.  No smile as the trap springs shut.

                               ISHMAEL
                     He'd lost a lot in the war, you
                     see.  I had sent him away.  To a
                     concentration camp.  But a nice
                     one.  Far less brutal than the Nazis.
                     Because I'm a civilized person.

     He stops.  Lets Hooks clear his throat.

                               HOOKS
                     I asked you a question, you're writing
                     a tract, h...

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's how journalists.  Answer
                     questions.

     Turns to Judge Fielding.  With all respect...

                               ISHMAEL
                     May I answer the question, Your
                     Honor?  Anout the defendant's
                     motivation to lie?

                               JUDGE
                     I wouldn't miss it for the world,
                     son.  Now, you say you sent the
                     defendant to Manzanar?

                               ISHMAEL
                     I didn't say.  I did it alone.

     And things get real quiet.

                               ISHMAEL
                     So there he was.  His father lost
                     his health there, finally died.
                     They lost more than Etta Heine's
                     seven acres.  They lost their
                     liberty, their dignity.  Their
                     ideals about this country.

     So much feeling in this.  He has to stop.  Swallow hard.

                               ISHMAEL
                     They lost their trust in us.  We
                     had treated them worse than animals.
                     How would we now see tham.  As human
                     beings?

     Tells the jury.  Straight to their faces.

                               ISHMAEL
                     This man lost a lot in the war.
                     He didn't want now to lose his
                     babies.  Or the woman who loves him.

     Another level of quiet.  He turns to the prosecutor...

                               ISHMAEL
                     And my expertise in this, sir.  Is
                     that I lost a lot in the war myself.

     Words coming from someplace very deep.

                               ISHMAEL
                     And the fact that I am the only
                     witness.  Who placed his right hand
                     upon the Holy Bible.  Is the least
                     of it, sir.  I assure you of that.

     Silence.

                               HOOKS
                     Well, sir.  I hate to spoil the
                     soliloquy, I truly do.  But the
                     fact is...you are not on trial here.
                     Nor is Judge Fielding, or myself.
                     Nor the good people of this jury.
                     For events that took place twelve
                     years ago.

     No sir.

                               HOOKS
                     And I wouldn't blame these good
                     people if they were a mite resent-
                     ful.  At a tactic that insults
                     their intelligence.

                               ISHMAEL
                     That's curious.  I was appealing
                     to their intelligence.

                               HOOKS
                     Were you, sir?  Can you prove one
                     word of all your fancy story?

                               ISHMAEL
                     No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a
                     reasonable doubt.

     And he smiles.  First time.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It's fortunate that the man who
                     needs to prove his fancy story.
                     Beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is
                     someone else.

     There is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve
     the tension.  The gavel BANGS.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I'm sorry, Mr. Hooks.  I apologize
                     for my tone.  This is not a contest.
                     Between you and me.

     Shakes his head.  No, it isn't.

                               ISHMAEL
                     For it is not.  As Mr. Gudmundsson
                     so wisely put it.  A small trial.
                     In a small place.

     His eyes are damp now.  Strangely enough, after all this.  He is at
     last on the brink of losing control.  Because...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I lost more in that war than
                     anyone will ever know.  So did
                     a lot of folks.  And what we got
                     back in return...

     His voice breaks slightly.  But it rings with dignity on...

                               ISHMAEL
                     ...was a country.  Where a man
                     was innocent.  Until we proved
                     him guilty.

     And the voice drops.  To just above a whisper...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Whether we all got cheated.
                     We're about to find out.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

     CLOSE on Hatsue Miyamoto, speaking earnestly, her eyes down, her
     purse in her lap, her slender hands expressing the intensity of her
     feelings as she makes her point, and we...

     PULL BACK to reveal that she is on a corridor bench, surrounded by
     a half dozen REPORTERS, who are crouching, standing, scribbling
     away.  Two PHOTOGRAPHERS pop flashes that she does not seem to
     notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we...

     PULL BACK, down the hallway to the POV of a man who sits alone,
     unnoticed.  There is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only
     hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the
     pristine cellophane.  His eyes are fixed to hatsue, holding court
     at a distance.  Fixed, as if no other sight could ever command this
     level of attention.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     All things considered...

     Hearing the voice, Ishmael looks down.  Uneasy to have been caught
     staring so intently.

                               NELS
                     ...you were adequate.

     No smile accompanies the irony.  For that would be condescending.

                               NELS
                     I could make a few quibbles, but
                     I am loathe to hurt your feelings.

     The old man sits.  Very slowly.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Cigarette?

                               NELS
                     I'll take two.  One for later.

     Ishmael tries to tear the cellophane without success.  Nels seems
     not even to notice.

                               NELS (quietly)
                     She is simply.  Beautiful.

     Ishmael's eyes cut to him.  A little quickly.  Confides...

                               ISHMAEL
                     I've always thought so.

     There it sits.  His fingers claw absently at the cellophane.  Nels
     makes no move to intervene.

                               NELS
                     If I whistle.  Those boys'll see
                     you, and come runnin'.  You're
                     the story today.

                               ISHMAEL
                     You ever been strangled by a
                     single hand?

                               NELS
                     Naw, I've seen what that can do
                     to a pack of cigarettes.

     Comfortable together.  In this hour of discomfort.  Ishmael brings
     the corner of the pack to his teeth, and tears the cellophane away.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Better take three...

     Fingers nimbly shred the seal, open the pack.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe they'll keep us waiting.

     Shake the tips free.  Holds the pack forward.

                               NELS (very quiet)
                     Maybe they won't.

     The way he said that.  Subtly ominous.  Ishmael watching Nels'
     face, as the old man takes two cigarettes...

                               NELS
                     Prejudice is like any obsession.

     Tucks one in his pocket.  And his eyes slide, unmistakably, to
     Hatsue.

                               NELS
                     There's a reason why we can't
                     let go.  Even when we want to.

     Ishmael is stone still.  Nels just gazing at Hatsue.  Until...

                               ISHMAEL
                     A reason.

                               NELS (simply)
                     We don't want to.

     Looks back to Ishmael.  Very straight.

                               NELS
                     Hate or love.  It works the same.

     In the silence...

                               ISHMAEL
                     Your client's wife ever mention?
                     We go way ba...

                               NELS (softly)
                     Her mother.  May have said
                     something.

     There it is.  Kindness in this old man's face.  He brings the other
     cigarette to his lips.  And Ishmael takes out the match box.  Never
     breaking eye contact.

                               ISHMAEL
                     We don't let go, you s...

                               NELS
                     It's a rare thing.  Takes a
                     turning point.

     Expertly, Ishmael's fingers withdaw a match.

                               NELS
                     You gave this jury three chances.
                     To turn.

     Palming the box, Ishmael STRIKES the match.  On his belt buckle...

                               NELS
                     No other way to explain it all.
                     That was one.  I caught some of
                     'em fluttering, waking up, on that.

     Reaches the flame toward the old man...

                               NELS
                     Second.  You sent him to
                     Manzanar, and you didn't do
                     it alone.  I liked that one,
                     they didn't.  No surprise.

     Nels leans to the flame.  Sucks it in.  Savors a drag.

                               NELS
                     Last.  You gave your arm.  To
                     buy this woman back her husband.
                     Are they gonna cheat you out of that?

                               BAILIFF (O.S., calling out)
                     JURY'S COMIN' IN...

     Everywhere, the buzz RISES, there is motion an expectation.  But
     Nels doesn't seem to notice.

                               NELS
                     Some let go, some don't.  Where
                     did you?

     Asked so casually.  Ishmael turns.  Hatsue is standing now,
     surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     Hooks called her deceitful.
                     And I knew she wasn't.

     He's watching her.  Across the way.  So intently.

                               ISHMAEL
                     She was an honest person.  Doing
                     the best she could.

     We follow her approach toward the courtroom door.  She has not yet
     turned to us.

                               NELS (O.S.)
                     The prosecutor, the judge, cut
                     her off.  She was desperate.  Her
                     husband helpless...I was helpless...

     Nels rises.  With great effort.

                               NELS
                     You couldn't let her.  Be
                     helpless.

     Ishmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her
     mother's murmurings, as she...

     ...disappears through the door.  Never having looked our way.

                               NELS
                     When this verdict is read.  She
                     may look for your face.

     And Ishmael's eyes come up.  Because the voice commands it.

                               NELS
                     Here's what she needs to see:  This
                     is nothing.  We win it on appeal.

     The old man is stern and strong.  He wants a promise.

                               ISHMAEL
                     It'll be there.

     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     The hush of a hundred silences.  We can feel the air crackle in the
     stillness.  Judge Fielding is leafing through papers.  No one
     coughs, no one blinks...

                               JUDGE (clears his throat)
                     Mister foreman, has the jury
                     reached a verdict?

     He looks up.  Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury
     box.

                               HAROLD JENSEN
                     We have, Your Honor.

     And holds out a slip of paper.  Little more than a scrap.  Folded
     once.

                               JUDGE
                     Will the bailiff please bring
                     the verdict to the bench.

     The bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the
     limelight.  He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and...

     ...stops.  Staring for a hung instant.  As if seeing something
     unexpected.  he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and
     as he hands it back to the bailiff...

                               JUDGE (softly)
                     Will the defendant please rise.

     Kabuo and Nels rise together.  But it is only into the defendant's
     eyes that the judge stares.  No expression in the face of either
     man.  But something passes, all the same.

     As the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we
     SNAP TO...

     REVERSE ANGLE...every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman,
     now opening the slip of paper.

     Every pair.  But one.

                               JUDGE (O.S.)
                     Will the foreman please read the
                     verdict aloud.

     One reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines.
     Toward a woman who does not see him.  In case she needs his eyes.
     To be waiting.

                               HAROLD JENSEN (reads)
                     We the jury, find the defendant,
                     Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not
                     guilty of the cri...

     A sharp SCREAM, and the defendant's mother-in-law covers her mouth
     in embarrassment.

                               HAROLD JENSEN (continues)
                     ...of the crime with which he
                     has been char...

     APPLAUSE breaks out from the back row of the gallery, where
     citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum,
     as has...

     ...a woman who comes OUT of her seat, tears on her face, not
     even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that
     separates her from her husband.  Throughout the gallery, now...

     ...some of the citizens assembled add their applause.  Others look
     awkward, not knowing how to react.

     The gavel lies untouched, unnoticed, by a jurist who has no problem
     with anything that is taking place right now.  Saying only to the
     jury...

                               JUDGE
                     This is your verdict, so say
                     you all?

     As they assent...

                               JUDGE
                     This Court thanks you for the
                     good work you have done under
                     difficult circumstances...

     Reaches STRONG to the gavel, turns to the defendant...

                               JUDGE
                     Go home, son.  God bless.

     CRACKS the gavel on its block.  The defendant is OUT of his chair,
     and with one strong grip of gratitude to the frail shoulder of his
     counsel, he is...

     ...AT the rail, through the POPPING of flashbulbs, she is IN his
     arms, the embrace so FIERCE on both sides, everyone crowding around
     them.

     An old man's eyes sweep the gallery, looking for someone.  Only
     to find...

     ...Ishmael's back.  As he disappears through the door.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - LATER

     The Miyamotos holding court, surrounded by nearly twenty reporters
     and photographers, and countless looky-loo's of all persuasions.
     Hatsue's face is flushed and intense, unsmiling, she seems scarcely
     to have caught her breath.  She holds tight to her husband's hand,
     as he...

     ...carries his baby son in the other arm, his 8-year-old daughter
     leaning against him, her 4-year-old sister standing on the bench
     beside her mom.  Kabuo submits to questions with a boyish grin of
     humility and friendliness.  An American family.  Photogenic as
     hell.

                               REPORTER #1
                     And how about the jury?  You had
                     confidence they'd see justice done?

     Kabuo glances to his lawyer, wanna field this one?  But Nels sends
     it back with a twinkle.

                               KABUO
                     Oh, sure.  These are our neighbors,
                     you know.  They've got good
                     hearts.  We could see they were
                     following the evidence real close...

     At his side, Hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces...

                               KABUO
                     We're just grateful to every one
                     of them.

     ...looking for something she doesn't find.

                               REPORTER #2
                     And you ma'am?  You felt the same
                     as your husband, I expect?

     Her eyes move to the eager young man.  She reflects for a beat.

                               HATSUE
                     Honestly, no.

     Which catches everyone.  A little short.

                               HATSUE (quietly)
                     I felt my husband would be found
                     guilty.  Unless proven innocent.

     No apologies for the truth.  That's not her way.

                               HATSUE
                     And Mr. Chambers did that.

     INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT

     A vending machine stands in silence.  The eerie strobing glow of
     defective neon.  PULL BACK as...

     Ishmael thinks it over.  Drops in his dime.  Pulls the plunger, to
     watch a Snickers fall.  Scoops the candy from the tray, pins it
     between his body and the machine.

     ...tears the wrapper.

     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR

     BACK to the reporters.  The crowd of onlookers has grown.

                               REPORTER #3
                     ...can we get some background on
                     your handsome family?  I understand
                     you two were childhood sweethearts...

     And brings his Parker pen to his notepad.  His subject smiles
     easily...

                               KABUO
                     Well, no sir, not exactly.  We met
                     in the Manzanar camp, you see, so I
                     guess that was the most beautiful
                     place I've ever been.

     There is gentle laughter.  And as Kabuo looks up, he sees something
     in the rear of the crowd.  Something we do not.  And softly...

                               KABUO
                     No, her first love was another
                     fella...

     Which brings Hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze.  And there, in
     the back.  A man watches.  Eating a candy bar.

                               KABUO (O.S.)
                     I was the lucky one.

     No one sees their eyes lock.  It is only an instant.

     It is enough.

                               REPORTER #4
                     It all sounds very romantic,
                     ma'am.  Falling in love under
                     those circumstances...

     And as she looks to the reporter, Ishmael begins to walk away...

                               HATSUE
                     He went off to the Army, right
                     from Manzanar.  And that last
                     night, we danced alone in the
                     desert...

     And somehow, Ishmael catches the eye of Hatsue's 4-year-old
     daughter.  So he pulls a coin from his pocket...

                               HATSUE (O.S.)
                     I told him.  If you don't come

     ...Ishmael ROLLS the coin across his knuckles.  And the child
     responds...

     With her mother's smile.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DUSK

     Alone on the steps where the Strawberry Princess once winked at
     him.  Snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful.  He
     squints up...

                     God's kindness, my father said.
                     Despite the hardship...it reminds
                     us.  Of our place in things.

     Our place in things.  He slides a black cigar between his teeth...

                     What the hell.  Did he mean
                     by that?

     He has the match box.  Manipulating it with the dexterity we've
     come to know.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Things fall on us, I suppose.
                     From the sky.

     STRIKES the match on his belt buckle...

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Wars.  Freighters plowing through...

     Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the
     cigar.  A single puff.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     And we seem...helpless.  Until we
                     understand.

     One more.  Savors it.  The sky.  The thought.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Accident rules every corner of
                     the universe...

     Down the steps.  Snow swirling between us.  Gone.

                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
                     Except the chambers.  Of the

          1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1

          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
          was admiring the falling snow when she saw
          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
          three drops of blood fell.
          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          And because the red seemed so alive against
          the white, she thought, if only I had a
          child as white as snow, lips as red as
          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
          all with the strength of that rose.
          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

          2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2

          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.

          ERIC (V.O.)
          Soon after, a daughter was born to the
          Queen and was named "Snow White."
          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.

          ERIC V/O
          And she was adored throughout the kingdom
          as much for her defiant spirit as for her
          beauty.

          3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3

          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,
          aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

                         (CONTINUED)

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Pick it up, William.
          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
          calming its flapping before she picks it up.
          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.

          4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4

          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Hurry, William! Hurry!
          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --

          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5

           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

                         6 OMITTED 6

          7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7

          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          We found it in the woods.
          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.

                         QUEEN
          It will heal in time.
          Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'll look after it.
          The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.
          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.

                         QUEEN
          You possess a rare beauty, my love. In
          here.
          (She touches Snow white's heart)
          Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need
          its strength to one day become Queen.

          8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8

          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
          offers it to Snow White.
          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
          tree and they fall to the ground.
          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.

                         KING MAGNUS
          My daughter will need your son's friendship
          more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I
          yours.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          We are here to serve you, your Majesty.
          As the King watches his daughter, ERIC'S VOICEOVER resumes:

          ERIC (V.0)
          The next winter was the harshest in memory
          and Snow White's mother passed away.
          Ba EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a
          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
          aside.

          ERIC (V.0)
          A year went by but the King was
          inconsolable. Taking advantage of his
          grief, dark forces gathered on the
          kingdom's borders.

          10 EXT. FOREST/ BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10

           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
           clearing. At the head is --
          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
          warriors.
          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          From what hell comes this army?

                         KING MAGNUS
          A hell they'll soon revisit!
          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
          him.
          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
          the battlefield. When they meet --
          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR

          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.
          All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
          shattering, evaporating.
          Strange.
          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
          that quiet.
          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
          all that is left in the field is --

          ERIC (V.0.)
          The unholy army was defeated, leaving
          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.
          King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When
          he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to
          look inside.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         10 CONTINUED: 10
          Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.
          King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a
          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.

                         KING MAGNUS
          You are now free. You have nothing to fear
          from me.
          Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
          King kneels beside the terrified woman.

                         KING MAGNUS
          What is your name, my lady?
          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
          his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.
          It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.

                         RAVENNA
          My name is Ravenna, sire.
          The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.

          ERIC (V.0.)
          So struck by her beauty was the King, that
          he forgot, for the first time, his broken
          heart.
          His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment.
          When she lifts her head --

                         CUT TO:
          10a INT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. l0a
          YOUNG RAVENNA - her face reflected in a small hand mirror.
          Ravenna as a child, beautiful but poor, looks into the
          mirror. Her MOTHER, a gypsy woman in tattered clothes, moves
          the mirror closer.

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          This - is all that can save you, Ravenna.
          The young Ravenna looks away, distracted by SHOUTS and
          COMMOTION outside.
          10b EXT. GYPSY CAMP - SAME - DAY. 10b
          A little boy, FINN, runs as fast as he can through the snow
          toward the Gypsy Camp.
          Behind him, THE KING'S RIDERS advance on the camp.

          BACK INSIDE THE WAGON
          Ravenna's mother tries to keep her daughter's attention --

           Ravenna!

          11 INT. PREPARATION CHAMBER/ CASTLE - DAY. 11


          CU - RAVENNA'S FACE
          Present day. Still as a statue and even more beautiful as
          cheeks are powdered, eyebrows plucked and lips painted by
          several sets of HANDS. Her eyes stare straight ahead,
          unblinking, her mind elsewhere.
          Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King.

          SNOW WHITE (O.S.)
          You're so beautiful...
          Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White,
          reverential, standing a few feet away.
          Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow
          White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out
          her arm - "Come."
          As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until
          only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's
          hair.

                         RAVENNA
          That is kind, child. Especially when it is
          said that yours is the face of true beauty
          in this kingdom.
          Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this.

                         RAVENNA
          (A warm smile)
          Would you like to be dressed up like this
          and married one day?
          Snow White nods.

                         RAVENNA
          I hope you'll invite me?

          YOUNG SNOW WHITE
          Of course.
          Snow White smiles, enchanted by her new friend.

                         RAVENNA
          I know it is difficult, child. When I
          was your age I, too, lost my mother.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You did?

                         (CONTINUED)

          Yes. A King tore me from her arms,
          dressed me in lace and stole my
          innocence.
          Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused.

                         RAVENNA
          I can never take your mother's place, but
          I feel that you and I are bound.
          (touches her heart)
          I feel it here.
          Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at
          Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in
          Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room -
          gives Ravenna pause.

          12 INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY 12

          Ravenna, in a stunning dress,.walks down the center aisle. All
          the NOBLES in the land are present.
          Ravenna looks at them, on either side of the aisle. They are all
          smiling, nodding appreciation. But they aren't really looking
          at Ravenna. She follows their gaze to --
          Snow White, behind, holding the folds of silk from the
          wedding dress. Snow White looks up, adoringly, at Ravenna.
          As the bride and groom reach the altar, KING MAGNUS turns and
          smiles, the happiest man alive.

          13 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

          King Magnus lies on the bed, drunk - half with wine and half

          Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace,
          holding a goblet. Staring a seductive hole through him.
          She starts slowly toward him, never taking her eyes off him.
          He licks his lips - can't wait for her to arrive.

                         KING MAGNUS
          (Gazing at her lustfully)
          Who are you?

                         RAVENNA
          The bane of Kings.
          When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls
          him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet.

                         RAVENNA
          Sup, my lord.
          King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body.

          Now you are mine.
          Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully
          wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down
          firmly.

                         RAVENNA
          I will destroy you.

                         KING MAGNUS

                         (LOVING IT)
          Indeed, you will.
          She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the
          lips. He can't believe how good she tastes.

                         RAVENNA
          As my people were destroyed. As my family
          was destroyed. As I would have been
          destroyed.
          He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show
          discomfort.

                         RAVENNA
          But when a woman stays young forever - no
          man can resist her - and the world is hers.
          He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise.
          As he struggles for breath...

                         KING MAGNUS
          What...?

                         RAVENNA
          First I will take your life, my lord. Then
          I will take your throne.
          She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER
          and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM --
          13a EXT. OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a
          Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna
          emerges. As she moves past them...

                         RAVENNA
          The King has laid down his sword for the
          night.
          Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and
          disappears around a corner.

          Ravenna's mother takes Ravenna's hand and holds it over a
          bowl of white liquid.

          You must trust me, my love.
          With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of
          blood fall into the white liquid - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
          Finn, Ravenna's brother blasts through the door.

                         FINN
          They're coming! The King's men!

                         RAVENNA

          Ravenna chokes it down.

          Drink! And with it the ability to steal
          youth and beauty! For that is your
          ultimate power and only protection.
          Finn steps forward.

                         FINN
          I will protect my sister!
          Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead,
          closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts...

                         FINN
          So it shall be, Finn.

          14 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE - PRESENT - NIGHT 14

          Ravenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a
          lantern. A portcullis opens and DARK FIGURES emerge from the
          shadows, entering the castle. Leading them is a tall pale-eyed
          warrior (FINN). He looks at Ravenna devotedly.

                         RAVENNA
          Welcome, brother.

          15 INT. CORRIDORS/ CASTLE - NIGHT. 15

          We see the shadows of the invaders sweeping through the
          corridors, putting the King's sleeping soldiers to the sword.

          Snow White lies asleep when she hears a bell ringing. At first
          she thinks she's dreaming, but then she hears cries of alarm.
          She sits up curiously, then climbs out of bed --

          17 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SNOW WHITE'S ROOM - NIGHT. 17

          There's panic and chaos outside, COURTIERS and SOLDIERS running
          for their lives. Snow White stares in confusion, then runs too -

          18 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT. 18

          Snow White rushes towards her father's chamber and sees Ravenna
          at the end of the corridor. Relieved, she hurries towards her
          stepmother when suddenly she notices her father's lifeless body
          lying on the bed. FINN and his KNIGHTS appear beside Ravenna. It
          takes a moment for the betrayal to sink in, tears of shock
          welling in Snow White's eyes, before she turns and flees --

          19 EXT. COURTYARD/CASTLE -- NIGHT. 19

          The chaos has spread to the courtyard, DUKE HAMMOND'S KNIGHTS
          struggling to hold back the invaders. Snow White hurries out,
          dazed by the sight of battle, then sees William pull free of his
          father's guards and run towards her --
          William grabs her protectively when strong arms reach down and
          lift them both onto the back of separate horses. Duke Hammond
          and his personal guard are attempting to ride out of the castle
          before the portcullis closes.
          The Duke rides under the portcullis with William. His bodyguard
          is about to follow when an ARROW FROM FINN STRIKES HIM IN THE
          BACK and both he and Snow White are thrown off their horse.

                         YOUNG WILLIAM
          Father! The Princess!
          But the portcullis is down, separating Snow White and William.
          The last thing he sees is Snow White struggling in Finn's arms,
          being hauled back into the castle.

          20 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - NIGHT 20

          Ravenna walks from statue to painting to urn, toppling and
          tearing them from the walls. Cleaning house. Ravenna's soldiers
          deliver a large object, then leaving her alone. A BEAUTIFUL
          MIRROR rests against the wall. Ravenna stares at it.

                         RAVENNA
          Mirror, mirror, on the wall
          Who is the fairest of them all?
          There'.s a brief silence, then the surface of the mirror ripples.
          LIQUID-spills onto the floor where it reforms into the shape of
          THE MIRROR MAN. His body is a veil of reflective bronze but his
          face-is a distorted version of Ravenna's own.

          your power and beauty?
          Ravenna smiles, moves to the center of the room, raises her arms
          and drunk with power --
          SCREAMS! The scream becomes --

          20a EXT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. 20a
          Young Ravenna's SCREAM as she is ripped from her mother's
          arms. Finn throws himself into the mix but is backhanded to
          the ground. Ravenna's mother moves forward, ready to attack.
          The Guard holding Ravenna pulls a dagger and puts it to
          Ravenna's throat, which stops her mother.
          Ravenna is dragged away and tossed on the back of a horse --

                         RAVENNA'S MOTHER
          But be warned Ravenna: By fairest blood
          it is done and only by fairest blood can
          it be undone.
          Ravenna looks back to see her mother and other gypsies put to
          the sword.
          Finn struggles free and chases after the King's men as they
          gallop away.

          Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs.

          She eyes the noblemen and guests from left to right. Their
          eyes beg for mercy.

          of Snow White, who stares defiantly at Ravenna.

                         RAVENNA
          Finn!
          Finn stops his exit with Snow White, and turns. Ravenna

          this one. And then,...

           HEAR ERIC'S VOICEOVER AGAIN --

           ERIC (V.0.)
          The spell Ravenna's mother placed on her
          gave her the ability to steal youth and
          beauty, and indeed all things good, for
          her own evil purposes. But for every
          life there must be a death, for every
          gain, loss, and under the reign of
          Ravenna nature turned on itself and
          people turned on each other.

          21A INT. CASTLE - NORTH TOWER - NIGHT. 21A


          ERIC V/O
          And all this time, she kept Snow White in
          a cell in the north tower.
          Ravenna, in the shadows, sits perfectly still. Though it's
          been years she looks the same. The object of her gaze is --
          Snow White, who has changed. She is now a woman, lying in a
          darkened cell. Asleep.
          Around the corner, Finn secretly eyes his sister, who doesn't
          notice him.
          Ravenna, just outside the cell, doesn't blink, entranced by
          Snow White. Strange.
          Snow White opens her eyes and sees Ravenna. This is not the
          first time this has happened. Their eyes locked. Then...

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why?...
          Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away.

          A chill wind whips through the woods. Lying sprawled on the
          ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like he's dead.

          It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the
          empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His
          eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods.

                         FLASH TO:

          THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN
          SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her
          dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out.

          BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM
          Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it
          again.

          ROSE (O.S.)
          Help!!!!
          He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a
          hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into
          his harness on his back --

          25 EXT. FOREST - DAY. 25

          Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a
          few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a
          beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR,

          (BROCH).

                         ERIC
          Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!
          BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.

                         BROCH
          Ale given you courage again, huntsman?

                         ERIC
          Won't take much courage to split your skull
          from here.

                         BROCH
          Aye, but first you'd have to see straight.
          Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear
          his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and
          MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened
          Greta's head --
          Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.
          Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and
          dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk.

          Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the
          trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only
          for Eric to duck at the last moment --
          The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now
          from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He
          draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks
          Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out.
          Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's
          pockets.

          Thank you.
          Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her
          thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin,
          examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind,
          looking back with an inviting smile.

                         ROSE
          I don't know how to repay you?
          Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and
          tosses her over his shoulders.

                         ERIC
          Don't worry, somebody else will.

          And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,
          just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and
          a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged,
          looking just as furious as the other women.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Her nose is on the large size and her
          chin's a little weak.

                         ERIC
          Your eyes are dim.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          I'll give you two gold pieces.

                         ERIC
          After all the business we've done
          together?
          Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Four gold pieces and that's my final offer!
          Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.

                         ERIC
          I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank
          you.
          The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:

                         SLAVE MERCHANT
          Ten gold pieces!
          Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just
          considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal.

          We get our first good look at grown Snow White as she shaves
          wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A
          regimen. Her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and
          blows on the kindling.

          The fire is now burning and Snow White warms her hands on it.
          She hears APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Unusual. She jumps up gets
          in her bed and pretends to sleep.
          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
          later the door CLANGS SHUT.
          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Hello?... What's your name?
          Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and
          looks out.

                         ROSE
          I am Rose.
          Snow White smiles - a friendly face.

          31 INT. QUEEN'S BATHING ROOM - DAY. 31

          Ravenna stands, attended by MAIDS, in a black gown, open in
          front. Appropriate in private but not when --
          Ravenna's GENERALS and Finn stand across from her. The
          Generals avert their eyes, made uncomfortable by her near
          nakedness.
          The General uses a pointer to make his presentation while
          another holds a map.

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          There are scattered rebel groups on the
          fringe of the dark forest, but they cause
          little harm.

          She dips her fingers into a bowl of DEAD SONGBIRDS, plucks
          out a tiny heart and eats it as she listens, not happy.

                         RAVENNA
          And what of the Duke?

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          We have pushed his forces into the
          mountains but his stronghold at Carmath 
          holds firm.

                         RAVENNA
          Lay siege to it.

                         ANOTHER GENERAL
          The mountains and fortress provide
          impenetrable protection, my Queen.

                         RAVENNA
          Then lure him out! Burn every village
          that supports him. Poison their wells.
          If they still resist put their heads on
          pikes to decorate the roads!

          BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
          My Queen.
          (chooses words carefully)
          They have taken the fight to us. Rebels
          harry our supply lines and rob our pay
          wagons. 

                         ANOTHER GENERAL
          We have just captured two of the rebel
          leaders. They will be put to the sword.

                         RAVENNA
          I wish to interrogate them myself.
          She drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath. She
          lowers herself into the white liquid. Her face disappears
          beneath the viscous liquid, then she rises, like a porcelain
          statue.

           ECU - A small songbird, it's chest open, revealing a small
           heart. Ravenna's claw plucks the tiny heart and we follow it
           to her mouth.
           She is dressed now and stands at a window, Finn at her side. 
           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - A CROWD OF STARVING PEASANTS at the foot 
           of the castle, fight over the milk pouring from her bath.

                         (TO HERSELF)
          I won't go back.
          She is lost for a moment, then...

                         RAVENNA
          Finn, do you remember when we were
          children, begging for scraps like those
          wretches?

          Rose and Snow White converse...

                         ROSE
          All the girls in our village were taken.
          I was trying to reach safe haven at Duke
          Hammond's castle when I was caught --
          Snow White bursts with hope --

                         SNOW WHITE
          The Duke?! He's alive?! He still fights
          in my father's name?!
          Rose stares at the feral girl now, realizing who she is.

                         ROSE
          You're the king's daughter? Princess?...
          The night the evil one's reign began we
          were told all in the castle were put to
          the sword. How were you spared?

                         SNOW WHITE
          William? What about William?!
          The Duke's son?! Is he alive?!

          Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears
          the distant cries of other female prisoners.

                         ROSE
          What will they do to me?

          33 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 33

          Ravenna sweeps into the great hall.
          The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares
          at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents.
          THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten,
          while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at
          her defiantly.
          Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward.

                         SOLDIER
          My Queen, these two were captured leading
          an ambush of our supply caravan.
          Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them.

                         RAVENNA
          You left your home, your family, the bosom
          of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why?

                         THOMAS
          Because under your rule we have lost
          everything. We will not stop until this
          kingdom is free.

                         RAVENNA
          Lost everything?

                         (REGARDS IAIN)
          Your son?
          She moves to Iain, right up to his face.

                         RAVENNA
          Very handsome.

                         (TO THOMAS)
          Obviously a debt owed to your wife.
          She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles
          against the Guards that hold him back.

                         RAVENNA
          There was a time I would have lost my heart
          to a face like yours -- and you would have
          no doubt broken mine.
          In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into
          Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the
          dagger, then up to Iain.

                         RAVENNA
          You would kill your Queen?
          She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and
          drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked.

          You have beauty. And courage. But how
          strong is your heart?
          She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his
          chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER.
          He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his
          ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead.
          Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son.
          Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand.

                         RAVENNA
          No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of
          the generosity of his Queen.
          With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that
          we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she
          falters.

                         FINN
          Are you alright?
          Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the
          others stare, alarmed.

                         RAVENNA

                         (TO ALL)

          OUT!!!!!
          They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as
          Ravenna leans against the wall for support. She pulls
          herself together, looks at Finn.

                         FINN
          Magic comes at a lofty price.

                         RAVENNA
          And the expense grows.

                         FINN
          You look...

                         RAVENNA
          old?...

          Tired.

                         RAVENNA
          My powers... fade.
          This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches
          as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he
          turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn
          nods.

          Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look
          at herself.

          FINN (O.S.)
          I have something for what ails you.
          She turns to see --
          Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles.
          Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires
          her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and --
          LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but
          instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth,
          DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming,
          her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until
          she's as old as the scullery maids.

          34 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL 34

          Snow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard
          opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Rose?...
          The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away.
          Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her
          out.

                         SNOW WHITE

          My Queen, you have defied nature and
          robbed it of its fairest fruit. But on

          I should have killed her as a child. She
          is my undoing?

                         MIRROR MAN
          She is also your treasure, Queen. It was
          wise to have kept her close for the
          innocence and purity that can destroy can
          also heal. Hold her heart in your hands
          and you shall never again need to consume
          youth. You shall never again weaken or
          age. Immortality without cost!
          Ravenna laughs, overjoyed.
          Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister
          laughing, giddily into her mirror, no sign of the mirror man,
          as if it exists only in her head.

                         FINN

          Snow White paces in her cell, frantic.
          Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and
          watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to
          tell her something. She moves toward them.
          They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
          the cell window, hovering there.
          She is confused but notices --
          A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
          Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
          loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
          bit, breaks free.
          She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when --
          The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

          She steadies herself, yanks once, twice and the nail comes
          loose.
          she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as --
          Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks
          into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head
          slightly to him.
          She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
          tries to lure him closer with her eyes.

          Are you always awake when I watch you?

                         SNOW WHITE

                         (HOARSELY)
          Yes.
          She looks away.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You've never come in before.

                         FINN
          My Queen won't allow it. She wants you
          all to herself.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'm afraid of her.

                         FINN
          Not of me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          No.
          He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm.

                         FINN
          It's alright, princess. You will never
          again be locked in a cell.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What does she want from me?
          His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it
          gently, and then to her chest. With his free hand he reaches
          back for his dagger.

          Your beating heart.
          Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks
          at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the
          dagger and --
          She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies.
          Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White
          kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind --

          39 INT. GRETA'S CELL/ TOWER STEPS - DAY. 39

          Snow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is
          shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her.
          Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her
          hands. Snow White takes them, looks into her eyes.

                         ROSE
          Go.
          Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face.

                         FINN

          GUARDS!
          Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away.

          40 INT. CORRIDOR/ CASTLE - DAY. 40

          Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED
          GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower,
          bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps.

          41 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAY. 41

          SNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost
          hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
          the courtyard toward the portcullis.
          The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
          follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
          the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
          As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
          darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through
          the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead.

          42 INT. SEWER - DAY. 42

           Snow White splashes through the deep stinking sludge.

          43 EXT. PORTCULLIS - DAY. 43

           The old rebel, Thomas, with his son's body draped over a mule,
          looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling --

          CHIEF GUARD 0/S
          Open the gates! The Princess has escaped!
          He stares in surprise as riders gallop out.

          44 EXT. SEA - OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 44

          Snow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed
          wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the
          depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface --
          gasping for air.

          45 EXT. BEACH -- OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY. 45

          Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large
          rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two
          MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
          direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
          waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
          climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.

          46 EXT. BEACH - DAY. 46

          Galloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White.

          47 EXT. DECIMATED VILLAGE - DAY. 47

          Snow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable
          now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or
          boarded up.
          A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,
          desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her.
          She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the
          devastation and the state of villagers all around her.
          At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
          their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --
          She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving
          chase.

          48 EXT. FIELDS AND WOODLAND BEYOND THE VILLAGE - DAY. 48

          The fields and woods are even more devastated than the village.
          Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All
          around Snow White the world is stubble and ash.

          49 EXT. ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49

          Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE
          DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps
          from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --
          then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on --

          50 EXT. MISTY BOGS/ ENTRANCE TO THE DARK FOREST - DAY. 50

          Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then
          suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White
          onto the safety of solid ground.
          Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not
          wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse
          backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the
          swirling fog --
          As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear.
          Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest --

                         50 CONTINUED: 50
          The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick
          in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog,
          frightening off the others.
          Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
          afraid to enter the forest.

          51 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 51

          Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up
          all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
          A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
          coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
          hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
          The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
          through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
          out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
          like a hand and now she runs --
          More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
          again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
          trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
          her until she finally passes out.

          52 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF DARK FOREST -- DAY.(D4N) 52

          From high above, we see the unconscious Snow White as mist
          whirls in a circle.
          52a EXT. CASTLE BEACH - NIGHT.(D4N) 52a
          Vicious waves crash into rocks. Nature's anger on display.

          53 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - NIGHT. 53

          From above we see Ravenna striding furiously in a circle of
          her own. She is livid, a whirling dervish.
          She's fairly spitting as she barks at Finn, who stands in the
          middle of the room, his face bleeding.

                         RAVENNA
          How is it an innocent young girl makes a
          fool of my brother?! Armed only with a
          nail?! If she'd had a sword she'd have
          taken the whole castle!
          We're in front of her, behind her, on her face, on her feet --
          She picks up the pace as well as the volume --

                         RAVENNA
          You swore to protect me! Do you not
          understand what, the girl means to us?!

          Finn and --
          BELTS HIM! Hard. He staggers a bit then picks himself up,
          looks at her.

                         FINN
          She was chased into the dark forest.
          She's likely already dead.
          She SCREAMS and slaps him viciously.

          She's no good to me there, lost. I must
          have her heart! You have failed me!

                         FINN
          Have I not given all to you?!
          She takes this, softens, unexpectedly, and almost smiles.

          Have I not given you all? All.
          She raises her finger and touches his face. His wound heals
          instantly and his face grows calm. He nods.

          ground.

          I have it right here in my pocket. If
          you'll just help me up.
          Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When
          he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in
          Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and
          kicks him in the side. Hurts.

                         BROCH
          I want my money!

                         ERIC
          Actually, I seem to have drunk it all.
          You're welcome to it when it comes out

          Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but
          somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at
          him.
          Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight.
          Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric
          comes in for the kill, winds up and swings -
          Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its
          legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his
          head back.
          Hands lift him and --
          Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few

          the room, eyes the ravens, then looks at --
          Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more
          interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are
          staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what
          he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her
          up like a tavern beauty.

          That is none of your concern.

                         ERIC
          I'll determine what concerns me, thank
          you.
          She smiles, moves even closer to him.

                         RAVENNA
          You will do this for me, Huntsman.

          Ravenna nods to the Guards, who pull their swords. Dying to
          cut him to pieces. Eric eyes them, then looks to her and, in
          complete honesty --

          So you wish to be reunited with your
          beloved?
          Eric reacts instinctively, grabbing her by the throat. The
          courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their
          swords, but Ravenna holds up her hand.

                         ERIC
          My wife is none of your concern.
          Something about her face, the fact that she enjoys his hand
          on her throat makes Eric queasy. He releases his grip,
          stares right at Ravenna.

                         RAVENNA
          My condolences.
          Ravenna holds his gaze.

                         RAVENNA
          You miss her?
          His eyes say, yes, he misses her horribly.

                         RAVENNA
          What would you give to bring her back?
          Eric stares at her curiously.

          You know of my powers. Bring me the girl
          and I will bring back your wife.

                         ERIC
          Nothing will bring her back.
          Ravenna moves even closer, looks him right in the eye. She
          is incredibly persuasive as she says --

                         RAVENNA
          I can. Believe me, huntsman.
          Eric's eyes say he wants to believe. Needs to believe.

          Mist drifts across the moors, the primordial trees looming up
          ahead. Finn and Eric ride side by side, FOUR GUARDS following.

          Come now, you're being modest. There is a

          Come now, huntsman, what do you feel when

          This takes Finn aback, not an answer he was expecting. After

          And what of them? At the tip of your

          Eric looks at him, realizing from Finn's face that it is an
          honest question. -

          They are all stopped at the entrance to the Dark Forest fifty
          meters ahead. The Guards gulp back their fears. Finn tries
          to hide his own.
          Even the horses sense danger and start to whinny and back up.

          60 EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 60

          Vines and roots have grown over Snow White's body, as if the
          forest is trying to devour her. She opens her eyes, sees her
          wrists and ankles bound and reacts in horror, struggling to free
          herself of her bonds.
          WE PULL UP, UP, UP until we can see the full scope of the
          Dark Forest.

          61 EXT. BOGS/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 61

          Eric and Finn have tethered their nervous horses and stand at
          the entrance to the bog.

                         ERIC
          Do exactly as I do.
          Eric carefully places one foot after the next on grassy stepping
          stones that disappear into the bog as soon as his full weight is
          on them. The others catch on and follow, stepping on stones of
          their own.
          Once they're across the bog and onto dry land Finn takes a
          step forward but Eric grabs his arm.

                         ERIC
          Exactly as I do.
          Eric puts a cloth to his face, gesturing for Finn and his guards
          to do the same and moves forward through the mushroom field -
          pops of pollen misting all around them.
          Eric stops, bends down, spotting faint FOOTPRINTS in the dew. He
          walks faster now, Finn watching in admiration.

           Snow White finally shakes free of the vines, jumps up and senses
           she's being followed. She looks up at the trees but all she sees
           are vague shadows. The wind picks up, ghostly voices howling in
          the breeze. She's rooted to the spot for a moment, then loses
          her nerve and runs --
          64aEXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 64a
          Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees.
          VOICES AND WHISPERS-call to them from the wind. Eric stops,
          looks around.

          Pay them no mind.
          One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he
          sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in
          surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out
          of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the
          depths.
          The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of
          their companion now, just the bubbling water.
          Only Finn looks unconcerned.
          Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand.
          Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a
          decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of
          him.
          They reluctantly follow Eric.

          65 EXT. DARK FOREST - MOMENTS LATER - DAY. 65

          Eric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting
          skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the
          distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning.

          66 EXT. TREES/ DARK FOREST - DAY. 66

          Snow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running
          out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the
          mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze.
          Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow
          White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing.
          Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints,
          then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth.
          Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's
          boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend
          herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't
          see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS

          GRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES.
          She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches
          down and turns her over.
          His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit,
          her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with
          one hand while he pins her with the other.
          Then grabs, lifts her.

                         SNOW WHITE

          trudging back.

                         SNOW WHITE
          She's going to kill me! The Oueen!
          He ignores, keeps moving.

          Sure she is.

          You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has
          many powers; she can take life or sustain

          I WANT HER BACK!
          His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe.
          The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
          Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
          slowly backing up.
          Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
          Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
          White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
          into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
          Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
          the others.
          They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
          raises a hatchet, throws it --
          Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
          wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
          huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
          Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
          notice her exit but keep fighting.
          Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
          manages to plunge a sword in his side.

          off but Eric lunges and --
          Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms.
          Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
          Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is
          hurt.
          Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a
          bit.

          The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward.
          Eric has a decision to make.
          Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant,
          grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet
          from the tree and runs after Snow White --

          Snow White crashes through the woods.
          Then a HAND grabs her shoulder--
          Eric. He slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream
          and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth.

          Eric removes his hand from Snow White's mouth.
          At once she PUNCHES HIM WITH ALL SHE'S GOT.
          He steps back, licks his bloody lip. She takes another swing.
          This one he manages to grab.

                         SNOW WHITE

          You're dead if you return without me. And

          horseback, when another rider appears, blocking their way.
          It's William.

                         BROCH
          Clear the road.
          But William doesn't budge.
          One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards
          William, drawing his sword. He raises it when William
          unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range,
          hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse.
          Broch draws his enormous battle axe, about to charge, when
          Finn rides forward and stops him.

                         FINN
          Wait!
          Finn sizes up William.

                         FINN
          You're quick with a bow.

                         WILLIAM
          I want to ride with you.

                         FINN
          Why?

                         WILLIAM
          You are paying well and I need the coin.

                         FINN
          Have you traversed the Dark Forest?

                         WILLIAM
          No.

                         FINN
          Then what use are you?

                         WILLIAM
          As you said, I'm quick with a bow.
          He nods to the guy on the ground, groaning with arrows in his
          thighs.

                         WILLIAM
          And unlike him, I have two good legs.
          Finn considers for a moment, then smiles, nods to the guy on
          the ground.

                         FINN
          Replace him.
          William looks at Finn gratefully. Finn studies him with a
          curious smile then rides on.

          Snow White approaches a stream, kneels, splashes her face and
          brings a handful of water to her lips.

                         ERIC
          I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          Not unless you want your bowels to rip
          apart.
          She turns. Eric has been snoozing on a rock, with one eye
          open. She releases the water, stands and faces off with Eric,
          who offers his flask of mead. She reluctantly takes a sip,
          spits most of it out, hands it back.
          He smells something, walks a few steps, bends down and examines
          a long brown pellet shaped object on the ground.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it?

                         ERIC
          A fumee.

                         ERIC
          You want me to call it by another name?
          He doesn't need to. It's an animal dropping. Snow White winces
          as he kneads it between his fingers and takes a long sniff.

          She catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the
          woods.

                         ERIC
          Stay here.
          He moves away, though the trees, tracking prey. He hears the
          wind call his name...

                         SARA
          Eric.
          He stops, looks to --
          An outcropping of rocks, surrounded by dense forest. From
          out behind a tree steps an apparition of SARA. She's
          beautiful.

                         ERIC
          Sara?...

          BACK TO SNOW WHITE
          She hears him call out and follows his tracks.

          BACK TO HUNTSMAN
          Sara holds out her hand.

                         ERIC
          Am I dreaming?

                         SARA
          Touch me and see for yourself.
          Eric shakes his head, looks around, tries to fight it, but...
          Her face draws him back and he begins to walk toward the
          rocks.

                         SARA
          You weren't there to save me, Eric. I
          called for you but you never came.
          Snow White appears behind and sees --
          Eric is walking toward a dark area where several sets of
          lupine eyes await.
          But Eric only sees Sara and he continues to move toward her.
          She opens her arms to him and steps backwards, luring him.

                         SARA
          Where were you, Eric? Come to me now.
          Protect me now.

           Sara, I'm so sorry. Forgive me, please
           forgive me. Give me peace. Sara...
           He takes another step toward her and --
          Buckles - THWACK!
          Snow White hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood.
          He hits the ground and she drags him away. He fights back and
          she jumps on top of him, staring right into his face.

                         SNOW WHITE
          She's not real! Not real! Do you hear
          me?!
          He does and calms. She gets off him and he sits up, fatigued
          by the experience. A low point for him.
          He reaches for his flask -- pours the last single drop into
          his mouth. All gone. He tosses it aside. A lost soul.
          Snow White watches him with some compassion. He catches her
          look, gets up and walks away.
          83b EXT. DARK FOREST OPEN AREA - DAY 83b
          Snow White catches up.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Who is she? The one you bargained for.
          The one that spoke to you. Who is Sara?

                         ERIC
          A name you'll not mention again.
          He tosses a knife to her. She's surprised but catches it.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What?

                         ERIC
          Feel its weight. One hand to the other.
          She shakes her head but does so.

                         ERIC
          Now hold it - business end pointed at me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why are you?--
          He lunges at her and she raises the blade.

                         ERIC

          He jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward,
          knife in right hand pointed. He starts to slowly move toward
          her. One step at a time.

                         ERIC
          Now stay back. You're too small to
          attack. You have to parry; use your
          opponents strength against him. Raise
          your opposing forearm.
          She does. He comes closer.

                         ERIC
          With it you block and deflect an opposing
          thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't
          die from it. Wait until I'm close.
          He steps forward.

                         ERIC
          Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes.
          He moves even closer.

                         ERIC
          Not yet. Not until you can feel my
          breath.
          He moves right up to her.

                         ERIC
          Now.
          Their faces are inches apart.

                         ERIC
          This close. Drive it through me. To the
          hilt. Now look in my eyes.

                         (SHE DOES)
          Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul.
          Their eyes are still locked.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why do I need to learn how to kill?
          He looks at her.

                         ERIC
          There's a lot you need to learn lass.
          Eric backs away.

                         ERIC
          Keep that.
          She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an
          instructor. He turns and walks away.

          A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,
          looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she
          were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the
          blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.
          Her look is one of conviction.

                         RAVENNA
          Find her.

          Finn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have
          that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
          trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
          group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
          the forest.
          William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
          CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
          without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
          others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.
          87a EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY. 87a
          Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
          -- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
          circling on the distant horizon.
          Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.
          They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is it?

                         ERIC
          It can't be this easy.
          He quietly unsheathes a hatchet.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Is this the end of the Dark Forest?

                         SNOW WHITE
          How far to the Duke's castle?
          He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE
          BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White
          stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open
          fens.
          They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge.
          They're half way across WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE THE STONES START

          TO MOVE BEHIND THEM --

          A PAIR OF EYES OPENS IN THE STONE, AND SLOWLY THE BRIDGE

          STARTS TO RISE --
          Snow White turns to see -- A HUGE CREATURE REARING UP --

          TWENTY FEET TALL. IT'S NOT A BRIDGE AT ALL BUT A --

                         ERIC
          Troll!
          Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
          the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
          ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
          giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
          As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
          way and draws his hatchets.

                         ERIC
          Run!
          Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
          as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
          legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
          The Troll falters a bit then --
          A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
          creek.
          Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
          ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
          hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
          The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
          to crush him when --
          Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
          The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,
          then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow

                         WHITE --
          She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE.
          The TROLL looms over her, but she doesn't retreat. She raises
          an arm, just as Eric instructed.

          Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
          almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
          The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
          until it finally turns and strides away.
          Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
          also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
          rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the
          arm.

                         ERIC
          I told you to run.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If I had you'd be dead. A "thank you"
          would suffice.
          It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back
          at him. Eric holds her gaze, struggling a bit, then...

                         ERIC
          Thank you.

          The sun glints through the thinning trees. Eric wades through

          Eric looks at her a moment, then suddenly turns away as he
          sees her expression change --
          GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
          holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
          but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.
          He draws his axe when A FIGURE IN A HOODED CLOAK (ANNA) appears,
          clutching her bow like a goddess.

                         ANNA
          They say only demons or spirits can
          survive the dark forest. Which are you?
          Eric, unsure, pulls his hatchet and steps in front of Snow
          White protecting her.

                         ERIC
          Which are you?

                         ANNA
          Neither. Perhaps you are the Queen's
          spies?

                         ERIC
          We're fugitives from the Queen.
          Snow White steps forward into the light.

          Anna sees Snow White clearly now, raises her hood. Snow
          White sees a deep scar running down her otherwise beautiful
          face. And then a smile.

          89 EXT. FENLAND VILLAGE - DAY 89

          The fenland village is made up of mud huts, elevated on stilts
          to protect them from flooding.

          Anna paddles a boat as they approach the village. Eric and
          Snow White speak quietly.

          ON THE BANK
          The boat stops and they get out. The women of the village
          move from their hut to greet them as they walk into the
          village.
          More women emerge from their huts to view the newcomers, no
          men in sight. They all have scarred faces.
          All the women have assembled alongside the group, watching
          with awe as they pass. They stare at Snow White and murmur.
          They can't take their eyes off her. Some even reach out to
          touch her sleeve or dress.

                         SNOW WHITE
          (sotto; to Eric)
          Why are they looking at me like that?

                         ERIC
          I don't know, but keep smiling.
          A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends
          and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the
          girl, trying not to stare at her scar.

          Snow white is playing with Lily. They are making little dolls
          from straw.

          I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's

          My father showed me how to make them. But
          he's gone away.
          Lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar..

          These women... This place.. It's very
          peaceful. But it makes me very sad.

          She stops. She knows.

          Because I'd think it too fell a task?
          You'd be right.
          She looks at him. Shakes her head.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That's not why. It's because I've never
          said the words.
          She looks at Lily playing.

          taught - waits for him to approach. When he's close enough to
          grab her slashes at him with the knife. The huge mercenary
          knocks her to the ground and advances on her.

          revealing a young warrior holding a bow.

          FACE TO FACE
          With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a

          Anna sees Snow White fighting off Eric and shouts --

                         ANNA
          You will! Go!
          Eric holds her firmly, pulling her away against her will.

          William jumps on his horse again, looking for Snow White through
          the clouds of billowing smoke. Finn and Aldan ride up.

                         FINN
          Have you seen her?

                         WILLIAM
          No, my lord.
          Finn spits fury and continues to race around, frantic.

          118 EXT. MARSHES OUTSIDE FENLAND VILLAGE/ LAKE - NIGHT. 118

          Eric pulls Snow White onwards, the blazing fires from the
          village lighting up the marsh. He sees a lake up ahead when a
          figure appears, blocking their way. It's the giant BROCH.
          Grinning, he unstraps his huge axe, ready to face Eric one more
          time. Eric doesn't even slow down, letting go of Snow White and
          unstrapping his own hatchets. It looks as if it's going to be an
          epic fight, but as Broch swings, Eric ducks and drives both
          hatchets into the giant's ribs, killing him instantly.
          They escape into the darkness.

          Ravenna walks up the spiral staircase. She passes an old
          woman who glances at her. She walks past a few steps, thinks
          she hears a whisper, then turns on a heel.

                         RAVENNA
          What did you say?
          Then she's right in her face --

                         RAVENNA

          WHAT DID YOU SAY!
          The "old woman" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's
          something in the woman's eyes that terrifies Ravenna. She
          backs up, retreating, then scurries away.

          118C INT.ANTE ROOM - ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT (MOVED FROM B4B). 118C

           Ravenna sits alone, naked. Her spine stretches through her 
          taut skin. 
          In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted
          tuft of HAIR caught on the gilded edge. She stares at it,
          then slowly raises her hand to a bald patch at the side of
          her hair.

                          

                         RAVENNA

           Finn, surrounded by smoke and fire, is beyond frustration.
           He screams to the heavens in despair.

          Eric and Snow White are far down river. They make their way to
          the bank, drenched and exhausted. Snow White's hands shake -
          distraught over the violence at the village. Eric looks at her
          guiltily.

          I led them there. I am to blame.
          Snow White looks at him with empathy. He's in pain, too.

          I will take you to Duke Hammond's.
          Snow White slowly nods.
          Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the
          trees. It dances on his face and then --
          A HUGE SHADOW blots out the light.
          Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he
          protects his face, we catch glimpses of brutal figures in
          battle masks. Eric kicks a couple of them away, but more of
          them swarm over him, pinning him down in leg locks and choke
          holds.
          Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs
          pinning her down. She bites one of her captors and he twists
          her arms behind her back. A noose is slung around Eric's
          ankles and he's hauled up - hanging upside down. Snow White,
          also tied up, sits on the ground beside him.
          A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their
          grotesque BATTLE MASKS.
          The dwarf leader, Beith glowers.

                         BEITH
          Well, well, well... the miscreant
          huntsman.

                         ERIC
          Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a
          friend?
          The dwarf leader, BEITH, glowers.

                         BEITH
          No, you horn beast, this is how I treat a
          friend!
          He smacks Eric with a gnarled stick.

          Snow White and the huntsman are still trussed up like chickens
          now. The dwarves are grouped together, arguing and occasionally
          throwing angry glances toward Eric. As they bicker the dwarves
          slap and bite at each other - like animals.

          What did you do to them?

                         ERIC
          I tried to collect the bounty on their
          heads. A few times.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Is there no one you haven't wronged?
          Eric nods at her. "You."

                         ERIC
          But there's always tomorrow.

          The Dwarf confab breaks up and they approach.

          This is my lucky day, the puttock I loathe
          most in the world lands in my lap.

                         ERIC
          It is your lucky day, Beith. I've got
          enough gold to keep you in ale for a year.

          NION, Beith's right hand man and a fervent dwarf supremacist,
          clips Eric around the ear.

                         NION
          Shut your ugly mug, huntsman. You had any
          pennies they would have fallen out your
          pockets by now.

                         ERIC
          It's hidden. Back there, in the woods. A
          short distance.
          They get the reference, don't like it. Nion slaps Eric again.

                         NION
          Pull the other one, you lying dangler.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Tell them the truth, huntsman.
          The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with
          his dirty teeth.

          He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at
          her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits
          with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her.

          Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his
          own.

                         BEITH

                         MUIR
          Quert?
          Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to
          Snow White. He touches her face and something happens in
          him. His demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on
          his lips. Meanwhile...

                         GORT
          So what's the verdict?

          Leave 'em to rot.

          Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot!

                         COLL
          That would work, too, but my way's
          cleaner.
          Note: Coll and Duir have this "at each other but we're
          comrades" relationship. Coll also has an incessant cough.

                         MUIR
          No!
          (a beat for emphasis)
          She is destined.
          They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the
          group and they dare not speak against him, even Beith.

          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

                         NION
          Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to
          stuff my ears.

                         GORT
          There's plenty of moss.
          GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
          plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized
          by the fairy music and the shimmering haze.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is this place?
          The huntsman looks just as dazzled.

                         GUS
          They call it Sanctuary, my lady. The
          Enchanted Forest. It's the home of the
          fairies.
          And slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest --
          as different to the dark forest as one could imagine --
          Life grows everywhere -- LUSH GRASS, PROUD TREES COVERED IN

          BUTTERFLIES, BUBBLING STREAMS, MOSS COVERED TORTOISES, FOXES AND

          RABBITS SIDE BY SIDE, EXOTIC FLOWERS AND EVERYWHERE THE LIFE-

                         GIVING POLLEN--
          Snow White sees tiny figures flying behind the trees -- almost
          too fast to spot -- the pollen following them in long trails --

                         GUS
          Fairies.

                         GORT
          Pests.
          Of the other dwarves, only the blind MUIR seems to appreciate
          the beauty around him, enjoying the vibrations on his face.

                         BEITH
          set up camp.

          130 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - SUNSET. 130

          HEARTY, SOULFUL SINGING. Seated among the ruins, the dwarves
          sing a Celtic ballad as old as time, GUS playing the fiddle.
          Coll and Duir sit away from the others, gazing out with the
          thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans.

                         COLL
          That song takes me back to the battle of
          Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army.
          Pickaxes against swords and spears.

                         DUIR
          Them were the days.

                         (BEAT)
          What happened to your quailing cough?
          Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join
          in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers
          over to GUS.

                         GORT
          Play louder, you whey-face, I can still
          hear those harpy fairies.
          He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of
          tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies.
          Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling.

                         ERIC
          Legend has it dwarves were created to
          uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not
          just gold and precious stones, but the
          beauty in people's hearts.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Really?

                         ERIC
          Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever
          had it. When the Queen seized their mines
          she stole their treasure but more than that
          she stole their pride.
          And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask
          of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song
          ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles.

                         GORT
          What are you pribbling at, longshanks?!

                         ERIC
          Nothing half-wit.

                         GORT
          I'm half of nothing.you canker blossom.

          Perched on his stone, QUERT nods; sings a more CHEERFUL SONG.
          Eric watches as Snow White walks over to Muir. Before she can
          say anything...

          That seat's not taken, if that's what you
          were about to ask.
          She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Thank you so much, sir.

                         MUIR
          It's only a log, no need to praise me.

                         SNOW WHITE
          No. For before. For defending me.

                         MUIR
          Your father was a good man. The kingdom
          prospered. Our people prospered.

                         SNOW WHITE
          There were more of you?

                         MUIR
          Aye.
          And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in.

                         GORT
          One day the group you see before you went
          down into the mine for a month long
          shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came
          back to the surface... nothing. The land
          was black, everything, everyone... dead,
          gone. We searched but...
          Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out.

                         MUIR
          That was the month your father died.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'm so sorry.

                         MUIR
          As am I, princess. As am I.
          GUS walks over to Snow White.

                         GUS
          I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss,
          but would you care to dance-with a little
          'un?

                         SNOW WHITE
          I'd be honored.
          Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up.

          Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus. Nion's not
          impressed, leans in to Gort...

                         NION
          I don't trust her. And I don't believe
          in her, no matter what Muir says.
          Gort is still melancholy...

                         GORT
          Just you and me,... do you think there
          are any of us left? Do you think perhaps
          they were merely banished?

                         NION
          As long as the Queen's in charge we'll
          never know.

                         GORT
          Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it?
          (beat; out of the blue)
          I feel funny. Queer almost.

                         NION
          Queer. Since when?

                         GORT
          How's your gout?
          Nion rubs his leg.

                         NION
          Better.
          Gort's look goes from Nion to Snow White.

                         GORT
          You don't think it has anything to do
          with...

                         NION
          How much have you had to drink?!
          The huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when BEITH
          approaches, sitting beside him gruffly.

                         BEITH
          Fleecing us of all our rum, eh huntsman?

                         ERIC
          What do you say, we let bygones be bygones?

                         BEITH
          Not yet, nut-hook. What's in it for you?
          (off Eric's innocent expression)
          I'm talking about the girl? Is it really
          just the gold?

          I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd
          have abandoned her long ago.
          Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance.

                         BEITH
          Muir says she's destined. Question is,
          huntsman, for whom?
          Gus and Snow White are still dancing.

                         GUS
          (As Snow White treads on his toes)
          You don't mind me saying, you got two left
          feet for a princess.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced
          in a long, long while.
          She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her
          with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Do you mind, Gus?

                         GUS
          Not at all.
          Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You've taught me to fight, surely I can
          teach you to dance.
          Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric
          stands and they proceed to dance, with her teaching.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Palms up, head straight, look me in the
          eyes. And...
          The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even
          softens as they both enjoy the dance.
          Beith looks on with a smile.

          Eric and the dwarves are asleep. Flowers have grown around them,
          as if they've been asleep for months.
          Cull and Duir sleep sitting up, back to back, at the ready.

          Muir, also awake and smiling, sits against the log, his hand
          rubbing his son's sleeping head.
          Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds.
          Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
          BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at
          Snow White.

          THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER.
          Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she
          sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two
          BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
          bodies, beaming at her.
          As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
          DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
          in alongside her.
          A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
          crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
          stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
          They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
          the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
          They rise and follow to --

          AT THE TREE
          She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART.
          The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden
          light.

                         BEITH
          No one's ever seen it before.
          The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm.

          The white hart bows before the princess,
          father.
          Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White. Muir's
          face is lit up in the golden light, his blind eyes shining.

                         MUIR
          It's blessing her.

                         ERIC
          What are you talking about?

                         MUIR
          You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see.
          You who have been with her the longest.

          So you're saying she is destined?...
          Muir can only shake his head.

                         MUIR
          No one listens to me.

                         (BEAT)
          Can't you feel it? Are you ailments not
          gone? Gold or no gold, where she leads I
          follow.

                         GUS
          Aye!
          The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs.
          As Snow White strokes the hart's neck, the golden light
          brightens, engulfing her.

          -- SUDDENLY AN ARROW FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND PIERCES THE

          WHITE HART'S FLANK.
          The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals
          scatter in all directions now, their sanctuary violated.
          Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees
          on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
          A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
          where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
          looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.
          The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their
          battle masks.
          WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at
          Snow White. He rides into the Yakut's horse, knocking him off
          balance just as he fires --
          The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus
          grabs her by the hand.

                         GUS
          Come on!
          He runs with her into the forest.
          Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but
          before he can swing the dwarves attack both men --
          Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the
          roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White
          Eric RUNS in the same direction --

          William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in
          pursuit of snow white --
          Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL
          and DUIR to give chase --

          132 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 132

          All around the forest the shadow of death is spreading. Gus
          runs, dragging Snow White behind him. Galloping through the
          trees, WILLIAM spots them up ahead, riding faster.

          133 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 133

          Bow and arrow at the ready, Eric runs after Finn. All around him
          the forest is darkening. He follows the sound of galloping
          hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow
          to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening.
          There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He
          spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's

          Coll and Duir leap up at Aldan, trying to drag him off his
          horse, but he's a ferocious fighter, driving them both back --

          135 EXT. ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 135

          William spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the
          trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and
          pulls him off his horse. Gus races over and raises his axe --

                         SNOW WHITE
          Gus, no!
          Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White
          recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I saw you at the village.
          William looks up at her, out of breath:

                         WILLIAM
          It's me. William.
          Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her
          eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe.
          William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White,
          when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP --
          Gus hears it too, spinning around --

          PRINCESS!
          Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow
          White. Before Aldan can load another arrow -- William fires an
          arrow of his own, striking him in the chest. The Yakut topples
          over, dead at last but still astride his horse.
          Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying
          Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers:

                         GUS
          I shan't leave you, Miss.

          Eric charges into Finn with a cry of rage. Finn deflects the
          blow and hurls him back into the trees. Driven by fury, Eric
          charges again, but Finn uses his anger against him, ducking
          under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own --
          Eric crashes into another tree. His eyes are still full of
          hatred but his body is weak. Finn smiles in contempt from a few
          yards away.

          Eric is shocked, desperate.

          She told me. Just before I slit her
          throat.

          Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches
          STICKING UP LIKE SPIKES. Finn steps toward him...

          Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC
          LUNGES. He throws himself at Finn, his momentum carrying them
          both into THE DEAD TREE'S SPIKED BRANCHES --
          The branches pierce Finn's body, their tips digging into Eric's
          flesh. Finn howls in agony --

          Eric holds him down, even as the spikes dig into him, forcing
          Finn's wounds to stay open - unable to heal.

           Ravenna sits at her desk - she is small and alone in the 
           vastness of the hall.
           She stares off into space, a quill in her hand - parchments laid
           out before her.
           Then suddenly her body convulses - the bottle of black ink 
           spills - dark tendrils of liquid seep across the papers and onto 
           the floor. 

                          RAVENNA
           Finn ...no! 
           She falls to the floor - writhing. 
           She fights hard at first - but then begins to weaken - her 
           power fades as she ages. 
           Then she stops.

          Finn gasps as he feels Ravenna cut him off. Reacts in horror and
          heartbreak as his wounds stop trying to heal.

          Then the light goes out of his eyes. He is finally dead.
          Slowly, Eric pulls himself free of the branches cutting into his
          flesh.

           She has broken their connection. We pull away from her. 
           Ravenna's head is down, depleted, forlorn. Completely still. 
           Ink pools around her bony hands. But when she raises her head --

          Still bleeding from his wounds, Eric hurries back through the
          forest until he sees Snow White and the seven dwarves gathered
          around Gus's body, chanting a low prayer. Eric stares in
          surprise, then notices William.

                         ERIC
          Who is this?
          Beith is about to reply when William answers for himself.

                         WILLIAM
          My name is William. I am Duke Hammond's
          son.

          Why?

                         WILLIAM
          To protect her.

                         ERIC
          The princess is well protected as you can
          see.

          her from here.

          William is about to react when Snow White turns...

                         SNOW WHITE
          Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend.
          He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is
          still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning.
          The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away.

                         NION
          We need to convene.
          They all follow him a few steps away, where they have
          privacy.

          What is it, Nion?

                         NION
          This is what happens when dwarves mix
          with men. We always come out worse. We
          have big hearts and we'll fight for any
          cause -- but for what? For some new Queen

          We shared a childhood together, before she
          was taken away. She hasn't changed. She has
          that same light inside her. Surely you can
          see it..
          Eric looks at her.

                         ERIC
          You'd be blind not to.

                         WILLIAM
          If we can just get her to the castle, the
          people.. The people will see it. She's
          our only hope, Huntsman.

                         ERIC
          We'll get her to the castle. Don't worry
          about that..

                         WILLIAM
          I've thought about her constantly. Every
          time I closed my eyes. I can hardly
          believe I've found her.

                         ERIC -
          You should tell her. She'd appreciate it.

                         WILLIAM
          I'm afraid to.

                         ERIC
          Not telling someone how you feel and living
          with the regret is a lot worse.

          Snow White sits on a rock, away from the camp, reflecting
          quietly.
          She stares out at the surrounding mountains and valleys when
          she suddenly senses a presence behind her. She turns in alarm
          -- but it's only William.
          William smiles back gently and whispers...

                         WILLIAM
          Walk with me.
          They walk into the silver birches.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Up here it's as if nothing's changed. The
          world looks beautiful again.

                         WILLIAM
          It will be. When you are Queen.
          Snow White turns, surprised by his words.

                         WILLIAM
          The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna
          with their very fiber.

                         SNOW WHITE
          It's strange, but... I feel only sorrow
          for her.
          William is taken aback by this but pushes on.

                         WILLIAM
          Once people find out you're alive they
          will rise up in your name.
          Snow White stares back at him uncertainly.

                         SNOW WHITE
          It takes more than a name. I an not my
          father, William.

                         WILLIAM
          You are his daughter. And rightful heir.

          He steps closer, gazing into her eyes devotedly.

                         WILLIAM
          If I had a choice, I would take you far
          from here. And keep you safe by my side.
          But I have a duty. And so do you.
          They hold each other's gaze, Snow White still ridden with
          doubt.

                         SNOW WHITE
          How do I inspire? How do I lead men?

                         WILLIAM
          The same way you led me when we were
          children. I followed you everywhere. Ran
          when you called. I would have done
          anything for you.
          She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to
          make light of them.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That's not how I remember it.

                         WILLIAM
          No?

                         SNOW WHITE
          No...
          They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I remember we were always arguing. And
          fighting. And...
          She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and
          kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William
          pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles
          as she sees that it's an APPLE.
          With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for
          Snow White, just like he did when they were children.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I remember this trick.

                         WILLIAM
          (With mock innocence)
          What trick?
          Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him
          before he can take a bite, raising it to her lips with a
           smile. As she bites --

          A SINGLE SET OF TRACKS.
          150g EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN. 150g
          Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking
          from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false
          William kneels beside her and slowly she sees Ravenna's
          features burning through, her cold blue eyes gleaming in

                         TRIUMPH --
          A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds
          shrieking in the sky above --

          Snow White's limbs are petrified, frost spreading across her
          cheeks -- but her eyes are open, taking in everything.
          Ravenna leans over her, smiling.

                         RAVENNA
          You see, child, love always betrays us.
          A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam.

                         RAVENNA
          By fairest blood it was done and only by
          fairest blood can it be undone. You- were

          and end my life, and the only one pure
          enough to save me.
          She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger.

          She raises the knife, about to cut out Snow White's heart -

          WHEN SUDDENLY HER BODY SHATTERS INTO A FLOCK OF SHRIEKING

                         RAVENS --
          And now we see the HUNTSMAN STANDING THERE, AXE IN HAND, THE

          RAVENS FLAPPING AROUND HIM --
          William blasts with a sword at the screeching birds --
          Eric goes after her now, swinging his twin hatchets. The
          ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them
          fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds
          finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon.
          Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves
          arrive too, hurrying through the snow.
          William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her,
          but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison
          drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at
          her. William turns to the dwarves.

                         WILLIAM
          What are you looking at? Help her!
          The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's
          desperate now, irrational --

                         WILLIAM
          You are dwarves, healers, save her!
          He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him.

                         WILLIAM
          Do something!
          Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening
          in them.
          William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes
          almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as
          great as his own, and finally stops fighting.
          Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
          something, then the light in her eyes goes out.
          The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed.
          William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips.
          He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then --
          Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the
          falling snow.
          On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone.

          ground. Their swirl becomes --
          Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by
          dead ravens. The effort depleted her. She GROWLS as she

          give me more grief. Am I right?
          The he touches her arm. Feels the fabric of her funeral
          dress. Looks at her face and breaks a bit - losing the
          drunken swagger and speaking with her as if she was still
          alive.

          You deserved better.
          And then he answers her...

                         ERIC
          She was my wife, princess. That was your
          question that went unanswered. Sara was
          her name. When I came back from the wars
          I carried with me the stench of death and
          the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth
          saving. But she did so anyway. I loved
          her more than anything or anyone. And
          then I let her out of my sight and she
          was gone and I became myself again. A
          self I never cared for. Until you. You
          remind me of her. Her spirit. Her
          heart. And now you, too, are gone. You
          both deserved better. And I'm sorry to
          have failed you as well.

          Eric, carrying all his gear, eyes down, strides toward the
          gate and a clean getaway.

                         ERIC
          Open the gate.

          PERCY (O.S.)
          Huntsman!
          Eric stops. He's been recognized. Percy catches up to him.
          They share a look and Eric sighs.

                         PERCY
          Yes, I recognized you.
          Eric sighs.

                         PERRY
          We have no quarrel with you. Not anymore.
          You returned the princess to us. And for
          that...
          He hands over a heavy sack of gold. Eric takes it, weighs it
          in his hand. God does he need it, but...

                         ERIC
          Keep your money.

          He hands it back and turns for the now open gate. He exits
          the castle and as the doors begin to close --
          SHOUTS OF JOY. Eric spins, wanders back to see what the
          commotion is all about.

          171 INT. GENERAL'S TENT - NIGHT. 171

          The council session continues. Duke Hammond stares at
          William gravely.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          My duty is to protect the people who come
          to me for help. I will defend them with
          my last drop of blood but I will not
          abandon these walls. I cannot afford to
          believe in miracles.
          He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder.
          He goes to the flap, opens it to see --
          Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands
           at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard.
          171a EXT. COURTYARD - DUKE HAMMOND'S CASTLE 171a
          Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow
          White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the
          stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're
          looking on an angel or a living miracle.
          Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is
          stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd.

                         BEITH
          It's a miracle!
          Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
          her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals
          follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes
          her by the hands as they speak.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          Your highness...
          (He can't believe his eyes)
          We thought you...

                         SNOW WHITE
          No, my lord.
          William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still
          looks dazed.

          You must rest -

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have rested long enough.
          Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction.

                         SNOW WHITE
          I am ready to ride by your side, my lord,
          when you face the Queen in battle.
          The Duke looks speechless for a moment.

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          There will be no battle, your highness.
          The best thing you can do for your people
          is stay safe behind these walls.

                         SNOW WHITE
          That is all I thought to do when I
          escaped. But I have come to learn there
          is no peace while others suffer. Have you
          not learned that?

                         DUKE HAMMOND
          The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot
          be killed. And therefore there can be no
          victory.
          Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:

                         SNOW WHITE
          I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the
          only one. She told me so herself.
          Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
          her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she
          reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...

                         SNOW WHITE
          I have been told that I represent you,
          that it is my place to inspire you. That
          is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a
          leader, not a warrior.
          Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights
          hang on her every word.

                         SNOW WHITE
          You represent me, who I've become - your
          hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires
          me.

                         (BEAT)
          I have also been told my place is not to
          fight but to stay here, safely behind
          these walls. I will not.

          death.

          Heads nod, people murmur approval. She has them in the palm
          of her hand.

                         SNOW WHITE
          If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to
          meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride
          to meet her.
          (looks back at Generals)
          Alone if I must.
          (back to people)
          But if you would join me, I will gladly
          give my life for you. For this land and
          its people have lost too much.
          Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder.
          Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat,
          then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His
          eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then
          Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even
          Gort and Nion.
          Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the
          kneeling warriors, and the responsibility on her shoulders.

          Ravenna raises her head to look into the mirror.

                         MIRROR MAN
          Yes, my Queen! Yes!!!!
          The Mirror Man laughs because Ravenna's face is younger, her
          energy has returned and we see why when --
          WE PULL BACK to reveal several CRONES, young only minutes
          before, now old and lying on the floor.

          mail glittering in the torchlight. She looks like an angel,
          bearing her fathers standard.

          We hear the sound of splashing oars and grumbling:

          comes into the view, the portcullis still down.

          187 EXT. COURTYARD/ CASTLE - DAWN. 187

          Coll and Duir move stealthily through the busy courtyard, so
          small and fleet they're almost invisible.

          188 EXT. BALCONY/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAWN. 188

          Ravenna looks on as her archers take their positions and her
          artillery men load missiles onto their trebuchets.

          189 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 189

          Snow White suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle
          walls. Eric realizes what they are and rides faster. The
          pinpoints of light soar up in the air, growing larger and
          brighter, until we realize they're FIERY MISSILES. Eric forces
          Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards
          from her.

          Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the
          ranks. Snow White takes her father's banner and holds it aloft,
          rallying the men and riding on.

          190 EXT. GATEHOUSE - DAWN. 190

          Two unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse. Before
          the other guards can react, Coll and Duir are on them, moving
          fast and hard, the assault over in seconds.

          191 EXT. SEWER MANHOLE/ COURTYARD - DAWN. 191

          Beith sees Coll and Duir signal from outside the gatehouse.

                         BEITH
          Come on!

          192 EXT. BEACH - DAWN. 192

          Waves crash over the rocks. Fireballs explode in the sand. Snow
          White sees men falling all around her, tears welling in her
          eyes, but she never falters. As William rides on, he sees the
          castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down.

          193 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 193

          The GUARDS in the gatehouse look over as the door splinters and
          the dwarves come crashing through in their battle masks. Even
          though they're outnumbered, the seven fight like demons -- until
          the enemy are subdued.

          194 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 194

          On the castle walls, archers replace the trebuchets. Snow White
          holds up her shield to protect herself from the sea of arrows.
          Up ahead, the portcullis is still down, Duke Hammond's forces
          circling back as they're trapped against the walls.

                         WILLIAM
          You must turn back!

                         SNOW WHITE
          I gave my word I would stand with them!

          195 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 195

          A huge pulley controls the portcullis. Beith, Gort and Nion draw
          their pickaxes while Coll and Duir tie up the guards.

                         BEITH
          Now let's see how this works! --
          With a mighty blow of his axe, Beith shatters the chains holding
          up the pulley. The counter weights go flying down and the
          portcullis comes shooting up -- then suddenly stops -- JAMMED.

          196 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 196

          The Duke's army are still circling the gates, stones and hot oil
          pouring down on them from above. Arrows slam into Snow White's
          shield but she still refuses to retreat.

          197 INT. GATEHOUSE -- DAWN. 197

          Beith peers down at the jammed counter-weights in frustration
          when he hears a fierce cry. GORT jumps on the counter-weight,
          trying to bring it down. Nion follows, yellingatthetopofhis
          voice. Duir puffs up his proud chest and leapsontoo--

          198 EXT. BEACH -- DAWN. 198

          Snow White sees the portcullis shoot up now, the dwarves hanging
          onto the counterweights for dear life. Smiling in relief, she
          gallops through the open gates with Eric and William.

          199 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAWN. 199

          The Duke's riders charge into the courtyard. ARCHERS fire at
          them from every corner of the castle, but they raise their
          shields and leap off their horses, forming a defensive wedge.

          200 EXT. BALCONY/ RAVENNA'S CASTLE - DAY. 200

          From her balcony above the portcullis, Ravenna watches her own
          men being slaughtered; she enjoys the spectacle (Ravenna does
          not care one bit about those men). Her eyes are locked on Snow
          White.

                         RAVENNA
          Let her come to me...ALIVE!
          Ravenna's soldiers are merely there to hold Snow White's army
          back. She has planned the whole thing, calculated every move.

          Like a spider waiting in her web, with no concern about her
          soldiers' situation, Ravenna remains calm and calculated.
          Ravenna turns around and leaves the balcony to the throne
          room.

          203 EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - SAME - DAY. 203

          SNOW WHITE rushes into the castle. As soon as she passes the
          door a dozen of Ravenna's men come outside closing the trap.

          Snow White storms into the throne room. She is breathing
          heavily, a mix of fear and determination.

          KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK
          The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls.
          Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs, the mirror room 
          behind her. 
          Snow White approaches. 

                         SNOW WHITE

                          RAVENNA
           I'll show you thorns!
           In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room 
           starts to shatter into millions of shards. 
          Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men - 
          the shards fall down like razor blades. 
          The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and 
          skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in 
          complete satisfaction. 

                          
          The millions of black shards circle around Eric and his men, 
          completely blocking them and keeping them away from Snow
          White.

                         RAVENNA
          Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too
          weak to raise his sword.
          The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven 
          foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's 
          ultimate soldiers.
          Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her.

          Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by
          these creatures; they move so fast. Eric tries to step away
          from them... to no avail.
          One of the creatures rises in front of William.
          William tries to slash the creature.
          His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right
          away. The Dark Faerie opens it's mouth and screeches.
          William gets smashed aside, saved only by his shield. The 
          Dark Faerie grabs the soldier right behind William and sends
          him crashing into the wall. 
          Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless.
          She looks at Eric one last time. 
          Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two 
          shields. He knows he does not have much time left but he is
          ready to make the final sacrifice.

                         ERIC
          (battle cry!)
          Kill her!
          209b INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 209b
          Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into
          the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna
          wants her to be.
          The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Ten years you locked me away!
          Ravenna seems to relish this. 

                         RAVENNA
          And every day, every hour led you to this
          ,moment. It burned inside you. It drove
          you forward, and here you are..
          Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards 
          Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword.
          Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her 
          to the other side of the room.

                         RAVENNA
          That's it. Fight. Fight for your land...

          Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under

          Ravenna treads on her back, then grabs her hair, pulls her 
          head up to see William and his men being massacred. 

                         RAVENNA

          Eric is trying to stay alive. He rams a Faerie into a pillar.
          Shredding the stone, the Faerie explodes in shards and
          reforms immediately behind Eric.
          Grabbing the first man in sight, the Faerie throws the poor
          soldier to the other side of the room.
          on the opposite side another Faerie slides faster than the
          blink of an eye, grabs the man in flight extending it's
          cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death.
          It is like carnage in slow motion.

          William is being overrun by a school of shards. The shards
          shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent
          arm blow, the Faerie projects William onto the banquet table
          six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William
          bouncing like a rag doll.
          Spinning around on it's way down, the Faerie skewers a
          soldier and impales another one into a pillar. The Faerie
          drags him ten feet up, tearing and digging deep into the
          stone column.

          She swings her sword at Ravenna. She parries every attack 
          with her bare hands.
          Snow White is breathless. One more strike... but Ravenna
          blocks it again, and this time she doesn't let go.

          Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too
          strong.
          Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but
          can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones
          crack. 
          Snow White screams in pain.
          The sword drops on the ground.

          Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the 
          room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected.
          For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so
          much hate.

          What else can she do?

          William, stumbling upon the dead bodies of his comrades, sees
          the shards starting to obstruct the entry of the mirror room.
          He runs towards it. Eric sees him and goes for it too.
          Behind William and in front of Eric, a Dark creature shapes
          up. William doesn't see it.
          The Faerie claws William from behind through his armor,
          stopping him still and sending him backwards against a pillar
          like a stone ricochet.
          The Faerie spins it's head 180 degrees and goes from turning
          its back to Eric... to facing the huntsman.
          Eric stops and tries to pull back.
          The Faerie powers up gathering shards from another creature,
          doubling in size and density.
          Like a fire hose of black shards, the Dark Faerie unloads a
          stream of razor blades at Eric.
          Eric digs his heels in... slowly grinds and slides on the
          floor, double shields up.
          The shields are being shredded. One shield gives way
          completely torn slicing Eric's arm.

          I will never stop... I will give this
          wretched world the Queen it deserves...
          Ravenna slams Snow White down onto the stone floor next to
          the mirror altar.
          Snow White stretches for her sword as Ravenna approaches. 
          Ravenna un-sheaths her dagger. 

                         RAVENNA

                         (TO HERSELF)
          A life .for a life.

          Snow White tries to reach her sword with her left hand, but
          it is too far. She tries to drag herself a little closer... 
          still too far.
          Ravenna straddles Snow White, raises her dagger above her
          head - smiling, relishing the imminent death blow. The black
          tomb has closed in around them.
          Eric watches - despair wrought on his face -- as the knife 
          falls. 

                          

                         RAVENNA
          (in a spell incantation)
          By fairest blood it is done!
          Ravenna strikes... in the blink of an eye Snow White blocks
          her strike, reaches for her dagger and plunges it into
          Ravenna's chest, just as the huntsman taught her.
          Ravenna gasps, locks eyes with Snow White. 

                         SNOW WHITE
          (whispers to Ravenna)
          By fairest blood... it is undone!
          Ravenna looks down. Three drops of blood fall onto Snow
          White's armor.

          BOOM... BOOM... BOOM
          Ravenna stares in shock and disbelief. 

                         RAVENNA 

          NO! 
          She pulls out the dagger, her face starts to age. 
          Ravenna is aging at an incredible pace. Her body gives way
          and she slumps to the floor, below the mirror. 
          She looks at the mirror above her, gasping, reaching out, her 
          pale eyes looking for a friend, a miracle... but nothing. 
          The black shards that entombed the room start to shatter and 
          fall to the floor.

          214 INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME - DAY. 214

          William is on the ground, out of strength and has given up
          the fight. A dark creature is slowly close to reaching
          William's face with his sharp claws as William tries to hold
          the creature's arm with his bare hands, severely bleeding.

          The Faeries have slowed down dramatically. Eric grabs a sword
          on the ground and slices the Faerie in front of him... the
          Faerie shatters.
          William looks at Eric, in desperation begging for help. The
          two men lock eyes. A silent understanding.

          Eric throws his sword and blows the other Dark Faerie in
          pieces, releasing William.
          A silent pact has been made at this moment between the two
          men.
          The remaining Dark Creature freezes. Eric and William are
          barely alive.

          215 INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - DAY. 215

          Snow White approaches Ravenna and kneels beside her, Ravenna
          is weak. She ages dozens of years within seconds, her face
          shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.

                         SNOW WHITE
          Why this? Why all of this?

                          
          Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
          Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
          White's.
          Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a 
          strange and affectionate motherly way.

                          
          Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of 
          the mirror chamber. It is over. 
          Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
          light above her from the ceiling.

                         RAVENNA
          (whispering to Snow White)
          See child,... we are bound.

                         SNOW WHITE
          (whispers to Ravenna calming)
          It will be all right...
          Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile
           on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow 
           White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. 
           The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.

           We're in...
          Packed for the coronation. Duke Hammond and Bishops surround
          her. Snow White smiles and looks out at all assembled - her
          subjects, her friends, the people she's come to know and love
          - meeting the eyes of Rose, looking young and beautiful again
          -- Anna and Lily -- the seven dwarves, who all wipe away
          tears.
          She sees William off to the side, smiling, looking on
          adoringly. But her eyes continue through the crowd, looking

                         FOR --
          Eric, in the very back of the cathedral, near the door.
          Their eyes meet, as if they're the only two in the room.

                         BEITH

First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

Then:

                    A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm not a poet.  I've never moved
          anyone with my words.
              (beat)
          Maybe that's why they chose me.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain
continues to fall.

Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

Still, the sound of rain is heard.

A MAN

40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.

He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant
expression, he has not slept in ages.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.

The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.

The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. 
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.

Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.

THE MAN

Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.

The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.

When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.

                    WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
          Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CABIN - DAY

The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind
him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are
also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the
acronym DBA.

Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.

                    GIBARIAN
          We take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  We're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  But our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          Earth to the cosmos.  We are only
          seeking Man.  We don't want Other
          Worlds.  We want mirrors.
              (beat)
          Maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  Maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

Kelvin sits back.

The visitors exchange glances.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SPACE CAPSULE

Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some
coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

two months later still.  He is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.

Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

                    KELVIN
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard.

EXT.  SPACE

The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of
the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of
the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder
of the area.

Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign
of life.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair
units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their
tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on
the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any
angle.)

Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small
carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM

Ransacked.

Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has
discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

VIDEO

Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but
extremely fatigued.

                    GIBARIAN
          Hi, Chris.
              (a light smile)
          I'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          I still have a little time, and I
          want to tell you something.  To
          warn you.  By now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get Snow or
          Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          I didn't lose my mind.  You should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          I'm not mad.
              (beat)
          If it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          You should know, I'm in favor of
          destroying Solaris.  I know
          that's... illegal.  And unethical. 
          And irresponsible.  But it's the
          only way to make it stop.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    GIBARIAN
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

Gibarian switches off the video.

The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. 
Kelvin moves toward it.

INT.  ROOM

A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    KELVIN
          Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? 
          I'm Kelvin.

A long beat.  Snow just watches him.

                    SNOW
          Yes.  We heard.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong?  What happened to
          Gibarian?

                    SNOW
          He's dead.

                    KELVIN
          How?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          Suicide.

Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    SNOW
          You didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    KELVIN
          What?

                    SNOW
              (musing)
          I love chocolate.  I realized just
          yesterday how much I love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          I thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, I've been thinking about it.

A long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow.

                    KELVIN
          What happened here?

Snow lies back in his bunk.

                    SNOW
          I can't talk just now.  I'm too
          tired.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Sartorius?

                    SNOW
          In his lab.  He won't let you in.

                    KELVIN
              (leaving)
          He'll let me in.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    SNOW
          ... try to stay calm.

          You have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

                    KELVIN
          All right.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  He is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    KELVIN
          What happened to Gibarian?

                    SARTORIUS
          Didn't you talk to Snow?

                    KELVIN
          I want to hear your version.

                    SARTORIUS
              (incredulous)
          Who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  At best, you're Employee
          of the Month for the highest bidder
          in the Solaris auction.  They have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          They've never even been in space.
          And I'm supposed to listen to you?

                    KELVIN
          I am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  Now: What happened
          to him?

                    SARTORIUS
          The same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    KELVIN
          Where's his body?

                    SARTORIUS
          In the lab.  With her, probably.

                    KELVIN
          Her?  Who are you talking about?

Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  He struggles to keep his composure.

                    SARTORIUS
          His last wish was to be buried on
          Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want
          to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    KELVIN
          They shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    SARTORIUS
          Just so you know: I'm not going
          back until I understand what it is. 
          I am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then I will
          go home.

                    KELVIN
          Listen --

                    SARTORIUS
          We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,
          I don't trust Snow.  There's
          something wrong with him.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door
closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius'
room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that
stops him:

A NUDE WOMAN

Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead.

Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the
time he gets there, she is gone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SNOW'S ROOM

Snow is lying on his bunk.

                    KELVIN
          Is there anybody else here?

                    SNOW
              (sits up a little)
          Why, who did you see?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian warned me.  He left me a
          message.

                    SNOW
          Who was it?

                    KELVIN
          She was real.  Where did she come
          from?

Snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    KELVIN
          Tell me.  I won't think you're
          insane.

                    SNOW
          Oh, that's a relief.

Snow lies back down.

                    KELVIN
          Where did she come from?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          How much sleep do you need?

                    KELVIN
          How much sleep?

                    SNOW
          How long can you go without sleep?

                    KELVIN
          That depends.

                    SNOW
          Well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Solaris.  Quiet, but still active somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          The Prometheus, as far as I can
          tell, is functionally intact.  Crew
          status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause
          of death appears to be suicide.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin speaks into a video communication device.  As he does,
we see images of the things and people he describes.

                    KELVIN
          Interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  All of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  Snow and
          Sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar I; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  I
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  I will
          attempt to convince Snow and
          Sartorius to return to Earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Later.  Kelvin is lying down.  The lights are out, and he is
trying to sleep.

After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair,
and lies back down.

Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep.

Silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, asleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, still asleep.  Then:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep.  Then:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Continued silence, AND:

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

REVERSE ANGLE

Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.

He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The
contrast with his older self is striking.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep on the ship.  After a beat:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

Rheya's LIPS.

Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

A WIDER VIEW

Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

KELVIN

Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.

RHEYA

Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.

He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.

                    KELVIN
          Oh, God.  I'm awake.

                    RHEYA
          Yes.

He looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you come from?

She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

Between kisses.

                    KELVIN
          How are you here?

She stops.

                    RHEYA
          How do you mean?
              (beat)
          Chris, what's wrong?

Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.

He stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.

                    RHEYA
          I love you.

He looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks
down.

                    RHEYA
          Do you love me?

He doesn't look up.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          I need to see Snow.

                    RHEYA
          I'll go with you.

                    KELVIN
              (rising)
          I'll just be a minute.

She bolts out of bed.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  I can't be alone.

                    KELVIN
          I'll be right back.

She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  All right.  Here.

He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    RHEYA
          What are they?

                    KELVIN
          To calm your anxiety.

                    RHEYA
          To calm my anxiety.

She takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are
in space suits.

                    RHEYA
          We're taking a flight?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
She is unsure.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.  I'll close the door
          behind me.

She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.

He walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

KELVIN

In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

RHEYA

Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

KELVIN

collapses to the ground, shattered.

INSERT:

A woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The
fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY.

ANOTHER INSERT:

A pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left
unattended for too long...

ANOTHER INSERT:

A rain-streaked window.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself
inside out.

A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's.

                    SNOW
          Was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    KELVIN
          Shut up.

                    SNOW
          I told you, try to stay calm. 
          You're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    KELVIN
          What was it?

Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    SNOW
          Personally, I think it's God.  At
          least, it fits my definition.

                    KELVIN
          And professionally?

                    SNOW
          I'm not sure.
              (beat)
          It started with Gibarian.  He
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  He covered the
          video lens.  Obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          I don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  By this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  He was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  Day and night.
              (beat)
          Who was she?

                    KELVIN
          My wife.

                    SNOW
          Dead?

Kelvin nods.

                    SNOW
          She has materialized from your
          memory of her.  What was her name?

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It started about three months ago. 
          Right after the government sold the
          expedition.  We were ready to go
          home.

                    KELVIN
          Will she come back?

                    SNOW
          Probably.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you'd told me.

                    SNOW
          Told you what?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What will you say?

                    KELVIN
          To who?

                    SNOW
          What are you going to report back
          to Earth?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.

                    SNOW
          An enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  We are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.
              (beat)
          You'll need to do something. 
          Otherwise they'll be sending
          someone out to recover you.

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian said he thinks Solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    SNOW
          That's ludicrous.  This is contact. 
          We have found God.  The only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on Earth.  So how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Before Kelvin's arrival.

Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.

                    GIBARIAN
          A pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          Probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  My view is
          that Solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  I think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          It hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  From the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the Universe.
          And now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the Universe, with us as the
          cast.

We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          It's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: Can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    SNOW
          It's God.

                    SARTORIUS
          I don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    GIBARIAN
          Nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    SARTORIUS
          What if this thing follows us back
          to Earth?  What if what's happening
          here started happening on Earth, on
          a mass scale?  Don't you see that
          as a problem?  I think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  For all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

Gibarian considers this.

                    SNOW
          We're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANOTHER VIDEO

This time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end.

                    GIBARIAN
          Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power
          isn't that God-like.  I mean, we
          have God-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the Earth around at will.
          Maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          We intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  Of course
          it was beyond our understanding.

          I've come to hate it here.  There's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  Humans.

INT.  LAB

Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet,
next to Gibarian: The Young Girl.

                    GIBARIAN
              (from a video)
          I thought I'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  But a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          So if I am consumed by the idea
          that I am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then I am insane.
              (beat, smiles)
          You ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          Maybe life just can't be solved.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is lying down, looking at the door.

After a beat, he turns out the lights and rolls over.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Time has passed.  Kelvin is asleep.

RHEYA leans into frame and kisses him.

Without even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

                    RHEYA
          I want you inside me right now.

They make love.  It's even better than before.

Kelvin and Rheya are asleep.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya,
who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. 
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away.

This continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches
her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the
train pulls away.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Rheya enters, looks around.  She spots Kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  Their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  He approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    KELVIN
          "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

                    RHEYA
          Book?

                    KELVIN
          Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of
          it when I saw you on the train.

                    RHEYA
          My Thomas is a little rusty.

He leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Not a very happy poem.

                    KELVIN
          You didn't look very happy.

                    RHEYA
          I wasn't.

                    KELVIN
          And tonight?

                    RHEYA
          Better.

He nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each
other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  He listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

INT.  FRIEND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Another night.

Rheya is wound up.  Not drunk, something else.  She has an
odd look in her eyes.

We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    RHEYA
          You want to fuck her?

                    KELVIN
          Stop it.

                    RHEYA
          You behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.  Not here.

                    RHEYA
          And I just want to know if I'm
          crazy or not -- if what I think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          Or am I one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  Who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

                    KELVIN
          Let's go home.

                    RHEYA
          You go home.

                    KELVIN
          I am.  Please come with me.  I
          don't want to do this here.

                    RHEYA
          You talk like an actor.

He is stung.

The immediate aftermath of the preceding scene, but at home
now.

Rheya crying as she embraces Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.

He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind.

INT.  APARTMENT - MORNING

Rheya, in a chair, remorseful, Kelvin is dressing.

                    KELVIN
          You're better when you take them.

                    RHEYA
          I know, I know.  But still, somehow
          I don't feel better.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  How about I feel better
          when you take them?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          Right.

They look at each other and understand; she will take the
pills.

INT.  APARTMENT - MORNING

Rheya, on the floor, dead.  Her hand outstretched, a repeat
of an image we saw earlier.

Rain streaks the kitchen window.

The bottle of pills nearby.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches.

                    KELVIN
          What do you remember?

                    RHEYA
          What do you mean?

                    KELVIN
          Do you remember Beethoven?  The
          Beatles?  Movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    RHEYA
              (thinking)
          Yes.  But not until you mentioned
          them.  As soon as you said those
          things, I remembered them.  And
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things I remember. 
          It's like filling up.

She looks out the portal at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          Is it a planet?

                    KELVIN
          Not exactly.  It exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the Universe.  An
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          It was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          We had to unlearn everything.

                    RHEYA
          Is it intelligent?

                    KELVIN
          Intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          Then it's God, right?

                    KELVIN
          It's something.

                    RHEYA
          You still don't believe in God?

                    KELVIN
          The whole idea of God was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called Man.  Even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  It
          can do this, it can do that!  It
          designs, it creates!

                    RHEYA
          Even a God that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    KELVIN
          You're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  You're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  Human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  How could we know what
          Solaris is up to, if anything?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          But what if Solaris is what there
          was before The Big Bang?

                    KELVIN
          As I said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          As I said, then it's God, right?

She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    RHEYA
          Why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

Kelvin smiles.

The intercom comes to life.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, you awake?

                    KELVIN
          What is it?

                    SNOW
          Can you meet me and Sartorius on B
          deck in an hour?

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    SNOW
          Just a little strategy session. 
          But in person this time.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is getting ready to leave.  Rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    KELVIN
          All right?

She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Kelvin listens.  A long time.

Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a CRASHING GLASS from within.  He hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce POUNDING.

He takes a step back.  An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  It sounds like a plane is
crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

RHEYA

Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    RHEYA
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          You were trying to break down the
          door.  Do you know why?

                    RHEYA
          When I saw you were gone I got
          scared.

He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

Returning, he blanches.

Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in
front of us.

She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, what's wrong with me?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Kelvin runs Rheya through a battery of tests and studies the
results.

                    RHEYA
          Am I all right?

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM

Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin.

                    SNOW
          He won't do it.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why do you say that?

                    SNOW
          He won't.

Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange
glances.

                    KELVIN
          This is my wife, Rheya.

She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    SARTORIUS
          We thought you'd be alone.  We want
          to talk about...

                    SNOW
          We want to talk freely.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.

Sartorius begins.

                    SARTORIUS
          I suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  We can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  Agreed?

Kelvin and Snow nod.

                    SARTORIUS
          I would like to start with
          motivation.  Why are they here?

Sartorius looks at Rheya.  She looks away.

                    SARTORIUS
          They are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          They are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    SNOW
          It's an experiment.

                    KELVIN
          No.  There's no behavior
          modification.

                    SARTORIUS
          She reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods.  She is struck by the word
"before".

                    SNOW
          The same vulnerabilities?

He nods again.

                    SARTORIUS
          A recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    SNOW
          And when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

                    SARTORIUS
          Followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    SNOW
          Are the actions of Solaris
          premeditated?

                    KELVIN
          Is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  I don't think so.

                    SNOW
          I'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    KELVIN
              (to Rheya)
          When you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    RHEYA
          Yes.
              (looks around)
          Of course.

                    SARTORIUS
          If they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    SNOW
          It's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

This is ten years ago.  Rheya enters, alone.

She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  Almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  She ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  A
moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway.  Eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    KELVIN
          Where've you been?

                    RHEYA
          I been thinking about how much I
          hate you.

She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  The light goes out.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          Yes, I remember that.  I went back
          to Lois' house and spent the night. 
          Those were dark days.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    RHEYA
          I would have these -- I don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when I was younger.  Maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  Time would just
          collapse, I would be inside time. 
          I would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  Freaky
          stuff.

                    KELVIN
          How old were you?

                    RHEYA
          Seven, eight.  So one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what I'm
          doing, and I start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that I can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    KELVIN
          What kind of look?

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    RHEYA
          Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. 
          Like I was something to be... her
          guard went up.  I was a threat. 
          Now I know why.  She was afraid
          she'd be seen.  That I would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  I think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  But that's the
          cycle, right?  I knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          I guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I know.  We don't have to
          talk about that.

Another beat.

                    RHEYA
          I remember days of just thinking
          about you.

INT.  OFFICES - DAY

Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these
images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

And they like it.

                    RHEYA
          Thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  I loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    KELVIN
          I did too.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    KELVIN
          I used to watch you undress.

As she does:

                    KELVIN
          I never tired of watching you
          undress.  Every time, it was
          exciting.  Right until... to the
          end.

A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him
leaving their apartment, angry.

ON THE PROMETHEUS

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What happened to us, exactly?

                    KELVIN
          You don't know?

Rheya shakes her head.

Kelvin just watches her.

                    RHEYA
          I remember... something burning. 
          Coffee burning.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

The rain-streaked window.

An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the
solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking.

Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

She is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this.

                    RHEYA
          You found me?

He nods.  It's coming back to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying,
but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is
crying.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Experiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in
front of her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Her eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    RHEYA
          Why did you say those things?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.  I couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in
her hand.

Kelvin kneels next to her.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

With Rheya still in his arms.

                    KELVIN
          When you said you wouldn't make
          it... I didn't believe you.  Or I
          didn't take you seriously, which is
          worse.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin holds the dead Rheya.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

Squeezing her.

                    KELVIN
          I should have believed you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they
were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting.

                    RHEYA
          I can't help feeling that I'm
          cheating when I take them.

                    KELVIN
          It's genetics.  You know this.  You
          know where it comes from.  There is
          nothing wrong with uncrossing a few
          crossed wires.

She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't
matter.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. 
Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    SNOW
          You're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  We are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  That proves that --

                    KELVIN
          -- we are not sure of that.  We are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    SNOW
          If God is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning Rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't God here?

                    KELVIN
          Not necessarily.

                    SNOW
          Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  You, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person I've ever seen! 
          This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

                    KELVIN
          Consciousness is enough, that's all
          I've saying.  Consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to convince?

Kelvin just looks back at Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It will end badly.  As inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

Kelvin doesn't respond.

                    SNOW
          Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is eating with Rheya.  Looking at her.  Desiring her.

                    RHEYA
          Do you have any idea how much I
          like fucking you?

                    KELVIN
          I think so.

                    RHEYA
          Good.  Because I want you to know. 
          I really like fucking you.

He leans over and whispers in her ear.  She smiles and leans
back.

                    RHEYA
          I like that too.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          How could she not be real?  I can
          smell her, taste her.  She does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    RHEYA
              (smiles, teasing)
          You know, I've decided: I'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole Solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  You must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          Great Big Problems all day.

He just stares at her -- he really likes this.  It's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Like I said, it's not possible.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          So, Chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

They laugh.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital.  Relaxed.  On the verge of
sleep.

                    RHEYA
          You sure say "God" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I'm putting that in my
          next report.

She smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Right.  The report.  Report and
          recommend.

They consider that.

                    RHEYA
          What does Snow think you should do?

                    KELVIN
          Snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet Earth.  This is
          hilarious: He thinks it's God, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

They smile at this.  Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's.

                    RHEYA
          Sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    KELVIN
          Well.  He doesn't think it's God,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          He's thinking: If I can figure out
          how to make it stop, than I am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be God.

                    RHEYA
          He has a point.

                    KELVIN
          He does have a point.  That's just
          not the way I'd like to see it
          proven.

                    RHEYA
          You feel sorry for Solaris, or for
          me?

                    KELVIN
          It's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          Don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: He is ruthless. 
          Unblinking in his prejudice.

                    RHEYA
          It was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

A beat.  He holds her.

                    RHEYA
          Do I really feel like... I am...?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Yes.

                    RHEYA
          I'm glad.

A beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning, slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the
dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

                    KELVIN
          Everything you pursue, you end up
          becoming disinterested in.  The
          fact that you're good at everything
          you try makes it worse.  You have a
          degree in animal science, you could
          be a terrific vet. 
          You drifted into writing and turned
          out to be a perceptive journalist. 
          Then it was politics, which seemed
          best of all, you had an actual gift
          for understanding the best pattern
          for a group of people to be
          arranged for you to achieve your
          goal.  And they didn't even know
          they were being arranged.  But you
          got bored with it, like you do with
          everything.

She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a
common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

                    KELVIN
          I don't know what it's really like,
          to not know what you want to do. 
          To not have anything that you love
          to do more than anything else.

A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her
cigarette at the moment.

                    RHEYA
              (sarcastic)
          Imagine my frustration.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep.

She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression:

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong.

                    RHEYA
          You don't love me.

                    KELVIN
          Stop.

A beat.  She looks down.

                    RHEYA
          I have to talk to you... I... I
          don't know where I came from.
              (up at him)
          Do you know?

He doesn't respond.

                    RHEYA
          If you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

Calmly:

                    KELVIN
          What are you talking about?

                    RHEYA
          That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya
          died.  Killed herself.  I'm
          different.

He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    KELVIN
          Who have you been talking to?

                    RHEYA
              (no reason to lie)
          Sartorius.

                    KELVIN
          When?  When I'm asleep?

She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but I don't know who they
          are.

                    RHEYA
          I'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          How have you lived the last ten
          years?  Did you love anyone?

A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head.

                    RHEYA
          Did you think about me?

Another beat.  He nods.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          But we fought.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Especially toward the end.

                    RHEYA
          Why did she do it?

                    KELVIN
          You... she said I didn't love her.

                    RHEYA
          Was she right?

                    KELVIN
          No.  I love you.

                    RHEYA
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          I love you, too.

If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    KELVIN
          Can you sleep?

                    RHEYA
          I don't think do.  It's not sleep;
          it's something else.  It's all
          around me.

                    KELVIN
          Those are dreams.

She falls asleep.

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    SNOW
          Gibarian was under enormous --

                    SARTORIUS
          Gibarian was helpless.  It's very
          simple: Man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          Solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    KELVIN
          Meaning Man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

                    KELVIN
          That's fantastic.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why did you agree to come here?

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
          Too tired to answer?

Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'll bet.  Is this what they sent
          you here to do?  You've lost it,
          you've gone native.

Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come.

                    RHEYA
              (to Sartorius)
          You're the coward.

                    KELVIN
          Don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    RHEYA
              (still, to Sartorius)
          I'm just as human as you.  I see, I
          hear, I touch, and I feel just like
          you do.

                    SARTORIUS
          Prove it.

                    RHEYA
          These "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  Chris loves
          me.

                    SARTORIUS
          YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

Kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    KELVIN
          Get out of here.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. 
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:

                    SARTORIUS
          Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A
          facsimile.  And she's seducing you
          all over again.  You're sick.  You
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  It's just fucking.

Kelvin backs away.

                    SARTORIUS
          There's nothing grandiose about it. 
          You've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

Sartorius turns...

                    SARTORIUS
          It'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

And leaves.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          We didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

Snow wanders toward the door.

                    SNOW
          I'm not feeling well.

He passes Kelvin and leaves.

Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya.  She seems dazed.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya is asleep.  Kelvin is talking to Snow on the
videophone.

                    SNOW
          We can liquidate the station.  Take
          the Athena back.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    SNOW
          Of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          We'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    KELVIN
          I've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  Why
          now?

                    SNOW
          Well, I think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  Certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    KELVIN
          But why is it doing what it's
          doing?  Given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          Presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    SNOW
          Perhaps it did.

                    KELVIN
          Human beings can die.

                    SNOW
          But they are human.  They certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          First they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  DNA doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  They
          build up with experience.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER

Quick glimpses of Rheya.  In several of them she is in
repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Back to Kelvin, thinking.

                    KELVIN
          They come when you sleep.

                    SNOW
          That's right.  And we all have to
          sleep, eventually.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin on the bed with Rheya.  Their eyes are closed.

We think they are asleep until:

                    RHEYA
          You don't want me.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          That's what you were saying.  I
          heard what you were saying.

                    KELVIN
          For a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  That's all I know right
          now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now,
anyway.

                    RHEYA
          I have these strange thoughts, I
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          I can't explain it.

                    KELVIN
          Neither can I.  Not any of it. 
          There's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  It's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    RHEYA
          But that's what happened before.

                    KELVIN
          Not this time.

He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    KELVIN
          Do you?

                    RHEYA
          If you're here.

They kiss again...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

Offscreen, we hear the door open.

Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  When it does:

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.

                    GIBARIAN
          Leave the light off.

A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    GIBARIAN
          I wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          I might not have had to kill
          myself.

He smiles, looking at Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          You think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  Understand
          something: I am the real Gibarian. 
          Just a new incarnation.

                    KELVIN
          What do you want?

                    GIBARIAN
          You're being tricked.  Sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  He's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on Earth.

                    KELVIN
          Can it work?

                    GIBARIAN
          It can.  Ordinary matter, like
          ours?  Not affected.  Everything
          else, disintegrates.

Kelvin registers this.

                    GIBARIAN
          What I'm saying is: Don't trust
          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    KELVIN
          I can trust Rheya.

                    GIBARIAN
          You'll end up like me.

                    KELVIN
          You're not Gibarian...

                    GIBARIAN
          No?  Who am I, then?

                    KELVIN
          A puppet.

                    GIBARIAN
          And you're not?  Maybe you're my
          puppet.  But like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  It's
          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if
          they're human!

Gibarian smiles.

KELVIN

wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:

                    RHEYA
          What's wrong?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.  He was here.

                    RHEYA
          You said he was dead.

                    KELVIN
          He is.  But he was here...

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,
some proof.  Finding none:

                    KELVIN
          He spoke to me.

Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.

INT.  LAB

Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's
body.

It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not
with him.  

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She
just looks at them.

                    KELVIN
          Are you going to take them?

She nods and takes them.

                    RHEYA
          What's happening to us?

                    KELVIN
          It's all right.

                    RHEYA
          Please don't lie.  I told you
          before, I don't know how I came to
          be here.  Whatever you think you
          can't say to me, I need to hear you
          say it.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. 
          If we're playing out what happened
          before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

                    KELVIN
          That won't happen again.  We're
          different.

                    RHEYA
          How can I tell?  You've seen both
          of me.  I only know what you're
          like here.  You're all I know. 
          There is no "You" from before.

She sits, frustrated.  Sad.

                    RHEYA
          How could it be so cruel?  How
          could it torture us like this?

                    KELVIN
          I don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  It's just watching.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Alone.

After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an
instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another
beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and
something tells him that's not a good sign.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL
STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a
passing room.

                    SNOW
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          She drank liquid oxygen.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems
very detached.

An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    KELVIN
          She's dead.

Snow says nothing.

Then:

Her finger twitches.

Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    SNOW
          She'll come back, don't worry.  But
          then what?  My theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    SNOW
          Why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  It's the most
          obvious solution: Escape.  She
          knows she can't leave here --

                    KELVIN
          Get out --

                    SNOW
          Oh, this one you love?  What about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  You didn't
          love her?

Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    SNOW
          What happens if she comes back?  Is
          that polygamy?  And even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  You think they're
          not going to notice her?

Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    SNOW
          I never get used to them, these...
          "Resurrections".

He leaves.

Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

She gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.

It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.

She begins to cry.

                    RHEYA
          What am I?  Why can't I die?

She turns away.

                    RHEYA
          I'm not Rheya.  You're always known
          that.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya --

                    RHEYA
          Don't call me that.

He turns her over.

                    KELVIN
          Listen: I don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          You are her, you are Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          I'm disgusting.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.  I'm not human.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm
          staying here with you.

                    RHEYA
          Then you'll die.

                    KELVIN
          I want every second I can get with
          you.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What will I do, if you die?

He doesn't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.

                    RHEYA
          Do you think I can get pregnant
          here?

A long beat.

                    KELVIN
          We'll know soon enough.

INSERT:

The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    RHEYA
          I can't be a mother.

She pulls back.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't do this.  I am literally
          begging you not to do this.  Chris.

                    KELVIN
          You should have told me.

                    RHEYA
          It wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    KELVIN
          Thank you.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    KELVIN
          Neither did I.

                    RHEYA
          You never said you wanted one.

                    KELVIN
          I never said I didn't.

                    RHEYA
          Chris --

                    KELVIN
          I can't stay here.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. 
          I won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Then you won't make it.

He leaves, brushing past her.

A long, held shot of Rheya, crying.  She is curled up,
retreating into herself.  Kelvin is trying to console her.

          I came back.  You have to know
          that.  I came back that night.

As we saw him before, sitting in the chair.  But we didn't
hear him say this before:

          If they succeed, you'll never see
          her again.

In the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the
liquid oxygen:

                    RHEYA
          You're afraid of me.  I can't do
          this anymore.  I still don't
          understand.  It's not possible.

He tries to console her, but she recoils.

                    RHEYA
          Don't --

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out.  She looks
desperate.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          What do I have to do to stop it?

                    KELVIN
          I want you here.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.

                    KELVIN
          You exist here.  I keep telling
          you.

                    RHEYA
          That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Who are you, then?

                    RHEYA
          I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    KELVIN
          Yes, you are --

                    RHEYA
          Did you hear what Gibarian said? 
          I'm not a human being.  I'm an
          instrument.  I came from your
          memory and your imagination and I
          will torture you no matter what.
          Even if I remain passive.  That's
          when I drank the...
              (beat)
          I was going mad.  It felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  There was something else. 
          An illusion.  But I could feel my
          heart beating, and I remembered you
          tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly
          like mine.

                    RHEYA
          But then I would be dead now.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Is that really what you want?

                    RHEYA
          I want to stop taking those pills.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you wouldn't.

                    RHEYA
          They do something to me.  It's hard
          to think straight.

                    KELVIN
          I think they help.

                    RHEYA
          I have consciousness, but I am not
          mortal.  Don't you see why I'm
          going crazy?

                    KELVIN
          You have to remember that I love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    RHEYA
          I can't --

                    KELVIN
          It put you here.  I'll admit it, it
          acted like a God and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          I was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And
          there you were.
              (beat)
          Whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  The decision we
          make now is all that matters.  Stay
          with me.

                    RHEYA
          Am I really her?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know anymore.  All I see is
          you.

They kiss.

                    KELVIN
          Stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.

Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow.

                    KELVIN
          She knows everything.  She knows
          who she is.

                    SNOW
          She knows everything?  Does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    KELVIN
          No.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What do you want?

                    KELVIN
          I want you to get Sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    SNOW
              (feigning innocence)
          What plan?

                    KELVIN
          Just get him to stop.

                    SNOW
          What do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You
          don't believe me?  Let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  I've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    KELVIN
          Her oxygen would have run out.

                    SNOW
          Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should
          we check?

Kelvin just stares at him.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to please? 
          Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this
          one or that one.  Can you face
          both?  We are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  So: Leave with
          her.  You'll see the
          transformation.

                    KELVIN
          Into what?

                    SNOW
          You'll see her die, that's all. 
          They're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  She will die.  Then what
          will you do?

                    KELVIN
          I love her.

                    SNOW
          You do, you don't.  She's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but

          Don't you see?  No, you don't.

          Kelvin.
              (beat)
          It is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  You are being manipulated. 
          You are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  If she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  She is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  You provide the formula. 
          You can only finish where you
          started, remember that.

          They sold us out to the highest

Kelvin wakes up.  Rheya is beside him.  He rises and heads
for the bathroom.

He swallows two pills and a small cup of water.

When he returns to the bed, Rheya is looking at him.

                    RHEYA
          What are you taking?

                    KELVIN
          A sleeping pill.  Do you want

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills
just beyond her hand.

BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS

Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want
the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her.

                    KELVIN
          What does it want?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  Something. 
          Anything.

She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          It created me and yet I can't
          communicate with it.  It must hear
          me, though.  It must know what's
          happening to me.  Don't you think?

          I don't think it dislikes us.  I
          think it just noticed us.  It
          lives, thinks, and acts.  We are
          dealing with a living creature
          here, no question.  And it's done
          something we've never been able to
          do: create a perfect human body. 
          Perfect except for the subatomic
          alterations, but...

          If Solaris is inside our brain, and
          it knows everything, and we're only
          consciously aware of what 2% of our
          brain is up to at any given moment,
          it knows us better than we know
          ourselves.  It's not even close.

                    RHEYA
          I've decided that if it is God,
          it's a sick God.  Its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          It's created a situation without a
          goal, and I hate that.  A God whose

          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          And us?  We would have to have "an
          arrangement".  An unspoken
          understanding that I am not human. 
          How can I not hate something that
          does that?

Sitting in the same position as it was on the Prometheus.

Breathes a sigh of relief at being home.  Everything seems
slowed down, somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I though I was home.

          When?

                    KELVIN
          Last night.  You were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    RHEYA
          You must have been dreaming.

She begins to cry.

                    KELVIN
          What's the matter?

She just shakes her head.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya?

From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying.

Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

KELVIN

Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I'm losing my mind.

          of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I
          return to Earth and lie about what
          happened?  Lie about having contact
          with something like Solaris?  I
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  I left
          them in the dark.  We all did.

          So why come back at all?  To see if
          she comes here?

KEVIN'S POV

Of the woods.

But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.

KELVIN

Looking from the doorway, notes this.  He doesn't seem
surprised, though.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I don't believe it will happen.

A flashing light on his computer demands attention.

A video message from Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't blame them.  I begged them to
          do it.  It's better this way.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I tried to make you think
          I was human.
              (beat)
          I read my own suicide note.  I
          found it in your things.  I
          realized I was not her.

She looks away.

                    RHEYA
          I know that you loved me, Chris.  I
          know that.
              (beat)
          I love you.

Kelvin breaks down.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him
is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is
the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem,
the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

The first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and
whispers.  This time we hear what he says:

                    KELVIN
          "Though they go mad they shall be
          sane.  Though they sink through the
          sea they shall rise again."

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kevin holding Rheya.

The note on the floor.

The rain-streaked window.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          "Though lovers be lost love shall
          not.  And death shall have no
          dominion."

Kelvin wipes the hair from her face.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          You killed her!

                    SARTORIUS (V.O.)
          Not her.  It.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius'
door.

                    KELVIN
          You murdered her!

                    SARTORIUS
          Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  She
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          She was gone.

Kelvin looks around.

                    KELVIN
          She'll come back.

                    SARTORIUS
          No, she won't.

                    KELVIN
          Why would you let her to do that?

                    SARTORIUS
          It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever
          it is, it's not human, and I am
          threatened by that.  Evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          And I want to win.  I want humans
          to win.  So I am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    KELVIN
          You fucking bastard...

                    SARTORIUS
          Whose side are you on?

Kelvin moves away.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Still turning, slowly.

But something about its appearance is different.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Complete chaos.

Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck.

                    SARTORIUS
              (yelling as he runs)
          It's changing characteristics. 
          It's solidifying taking on weight.

                    KELVIN
          How quickly?

                    SARTORIUS
          If it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.

INT.  FLIGHT DECK

Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is
sitting in his room.

                    KELVIN
              (via intercom)
          Snow!  We need you up here.

Snow doesn't reply.

                    KELVIN
          Snow!

Snow looks up.  There's a strange look on his face.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong with you?  We need
          your help.

                    SNOW
          I won't be making the trip.

                    SARTORIUS
          Snow, get up here, now.

                    SNOW
          I'm not Snow.

This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    SNOW
          I got rid of him.  I wanted to see
          if... I wanted to be the only one. 
          I wanted to be Snow.

                    SARTORIUS
          Fuck me.  I knew it.

                    KELVIN
          When did this happen?

                    SNOW
          Oh, right away.  That's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  You
          should've noticed that.  I miss
          him, though.  I think I made a
          mistake.

                    KELVIN
          Jesus...

                    SNOW
          But I can't leave with you.  I
          won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Maybe you can.

                    SARTORIUS
          You want it coming back with us?

                    SNOW
          You go ahead.  Of what I remember
          about Earth... it's all one thing
          now.  Everything's a blur.  I like
          distinctions.

Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          We do not have time to deal with
          this.  Get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the
monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Silence.

The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.

CLOSER ON SOLARIS

After the ship has gone.

A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.

Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.

Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY

Kelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain
continues.

He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Earth.
              (beat)
          What did that word mean to me?
              (beat)
          I have returned.  Finally.

Kelvin begins to walk.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I work in the city now.  After work
          I wander and lose myself.  I am
          silent and attentive.  I follow the
          current.  I make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on Earth.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will study these gestures until
          they become reflexes again.  I will
          find new interests and occupations,
          but --

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.

Kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will not... give myself.  I will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because I am haunted by the
          idea that I remembered her wrong. 
          That I shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  That I was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          What if I was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          I've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.

RHEYA

Is in the living room, waiting for him.

She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

KELVIN

Opens the door.  He cannot speak.

RHEYA

Rises and moves toward him.

They embrace.

He breathes her in.  She squeezes him.

After a long beat:

                    KELVIN
          How can you be here...

                    RHEYA
              (whispering)
          Shhhh.  Just stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.  Everything is
          forgiven.  Everything.

She sways with him, gently.  His body relaxes.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

A tableau of the cabin.  The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound.

These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.

                                                FADE OUT.

First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

Then:

                    A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm not a poet.  I've never moved
          anyone with my words.
              (beat)
          Maybe that's why they chose me.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain
continues to fall.

Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

Still, the sound of rain is heard.

A MAN

40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.

He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant
expression, he has not slept in ages.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.

The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.

The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. 
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.

Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.

THE MAN

Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.

The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.

When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.

                    WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
          Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CABIN - DAY

The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind
him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are
also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the
acronym DBA.

Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.

                    GIBARIAN
          We take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  We're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  But our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          Earth to the cosmos.  We are only
          seeking Man.  We don't want Other
          Worlds.  We want mirrors.
              (beat)
          Maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  Maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

Kelvin sits back.

The visitors exchange glances.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SPACE CAPSULE

Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some
coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

two months later still.  He is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.

Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

                    KELVIN
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard.

EXT.  SPACE

The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of
the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of
the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder
of the area.

Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign
of life.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair
units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their
tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on
the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any
angle.)

Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small
carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM

Ransacked.

Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has
discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

VIDEO

Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but
extremely fatigued.

                    GIBARIAN
          Hi, Chris.
              (a light smile)
          I'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          I still have a little time, and I
          want to tell you something.  To
          warn you.  By now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get Snow or
          Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          I didn't lose my mind.  You should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          I'm not mad.
              (beat)
          If it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          You should know, I'm in favor of
          destroying Solaris.  I know
          that's... illegal.  And unethical. 
          And irresponsible.  But it's the
          only way to make it stop.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    GIBARIAN
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

Gibarian switches off the video.

The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. 
Kelvin moves toward it.

INT.  ROOM

A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    KELVIN
          Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? 
          I'm Kelvin.

A long beat.  Snow just watches him.

                    SNOW
          Yes.  We heard.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong?  What happened to
          Gibarian?

                    SNOW
          He's dead.

                    KELVIN
          How?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          Suicide.

Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    SNOW
          You didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    KELVIN
          What?

                    SNOW
              (musing)
          I love chocolate.  I realized just
          yesterday how much I love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          I thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, I've been thinking about it.

A long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow.

                    KELVIN
          What happened here?

Snow lies back in his bunk.

                    SNOW
          I can't talk just now.  I'm too
          tired.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Sartorius?

                    SNOW
          In his lab.  He won't let you in.

                    KELVIN
              (leaving)
          He'll let me in.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    SNOW
          ... try to stay calm.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin stands outside a door.

                    KELVIN
          Let me in.

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
              (inside, muffled)
          You have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

                    KELVIN
          All right.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  He is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    KELVIN
          What happened to Gibarian?

                    SARTORIUS
          Didn't you talk to Snow?

                    KELVIN
          I want to hear your version.

                    SARTORIUS
              (incredulous)
          Who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  At best, you're Employee
          of the Month for the highest bidder
          in the Solaris auction.  They have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          They've never even been in space.
          And I'm supposed to listen to you?

                    KELVIN
          I am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  Now: What happened
          to him?

                    SARTORIUS
          The same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    KELVIN
          Where's his body?

                    SARTORIUS
          In the lab.  With her, probably.

                    KELVIN
          Her?  Who are you talking about?

Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  He struggles to keep his composure.

                    SARTORIUS
          His last wish was to be buried on
          Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want
          to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    KELVIN
          They shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    SARTORIUS
          Just so you know: I'm not going
          back until I understand what it is. 
          I am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then I will
          go home.

                    KELVIN
          Listen --

                    SARTORIUS
          We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,
          I don't trust Snow.  There's
          something wrong with him.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door
closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius'
room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that
stops him:

A NUDE WOMAN

Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead.

Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the
time he gets there, she is gone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SNOW'S ROOM

Snow is lying on his bunk.

                    KELVIN
          Is there anybody else here?

                    SNOW
              (sits up a little)
          Why, who did you see?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian warned me.  He left me a
          message.

                    SNOW
          Who was it?

                    KELVIN
          She was real.  Where did she come
          from?

Snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    KELVIN
          Tell me.  I won't think you're
          insane.

                    SNOW
          Oh, that's a relief.

Snow lies back down.

                    KELVIN
          Where did she come from?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          How much sleep do you need?

                    KELVIN
          How much sleep?

                    SNOW
          How long can you go without sleep?

                    KELVIN
          That depends.

                    SNOW
          Well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Solaris.  Quiet, but still active somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          The Prometheus, as far as I can
          tell, is functionally intact.  Crew
          status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause
          of death appears to be suicide.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin speaks into a video communication device.  As he does,
we see images of the things and people he describes.

                    KELVIN
          Interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  All of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  Snow and
          Sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar I; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  I
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  I will
          attempt to convince Snow and
          Sartorius to return to Earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Later.  Kelvin is lying down.  The lights are out, and he is
trying to sleep.

After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair,
and lies back down.

Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep.

Silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, asleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, still asleep.  Then:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep.  Then:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Continued silence, AND:

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

REVERSE ANGLE

Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.

He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The
contrast with his older self is striking.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep on the ship.  After a beat:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

Rheya's LIPS.

Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

A WIDER VIEW

Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

KELVIN

Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.

RHEYA

Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.

He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.

                    KELVIN
          Oh, God.  I'm awake.

                    RHEYA
          Yes.

He looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you come from?

She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

Between kisses.

                    KELVIN
          How are you here?

She stops.

                    RHEYA
          How do you mean?
              (beat)
          Chris, what's wrong?

Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.

He stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.

                    RHEYA
          I love you.

He looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks
down.

                    RHEYA
          Do you love me?

He doesn't look up.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          I need to see Snow.

                    RHEYA
          I'll go with you.

                    KELVIN
              (rising)
          I'll just be a minute.

She bolts out of bed.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  I can't be alone.

                    KELVIN
          I'll be right back.

She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  All right.  Here.

He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    RHEYA
          What are they?

                    KELVIN
          To calm your anxiety.

                    RHEYA
          To calm my anxiety.

She takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are
in space suits.

                    RHEYA
          We're taking a flight?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
She is unsure.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.  I'll close the door
          behind me.

She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.

He walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

KELVIN

In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

RHEYA

Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

KELVIN

collapses to the ground, shattered.

INSERT:

A woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The
fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY.

ANOTHER INSERT:

A pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left
unattended for too long...

ANOTHER INSERT:

A rain-streaked window.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself
inside out.

A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's.

                    SNOW
          Was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    KELVIN
          Shut up.

                    SNOW
          I told you, try to stay calm. 
          You're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    KELVIN
          What was it?

Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    SNOW
          Personally, I think it's God.  At
          least, it fits my definition.

                    KELVIN
          And professionally?

                    SNOW
          I'm not sure.
              (beat)
          It started with Gibarian.  He
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  He covered the
          video lens.  Obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          I don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  By this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  He was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  Day and night.
              (beat)
          Who was she?

                    KELVIN
          My wife.

                    SNOW
          Dead?

Kelvin nods.

                    SNOW
          She has materialized from your
          memory of her.  What was her name?

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It started about three months ago. 
          Right after the government sold the
          expedition.  We were ready to go
          home.

                    KELVIN
          Will she come back?

                    SNOW
          Probably.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you'd told me.

                    SNOW
          Told you what?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What will you say?

                    KELVIN
          To who?

                    SNOW
          What are you going to report back
          to Earth?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.

                    SNOW
          An enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  We are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.
              (beat)
          You'll need to do something. 
          Otherwise they'll be sending
          someone out to recover you.

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian said he thinks Solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    SNOW
          That's ludicrous.  This is contact. 
          We have found God.  The only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on Earth.  So how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Before Kelvin's arrival.

Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.

                    GIBARIAN
          A pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          Probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  My view is
          that Solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  I think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          It hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  From the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the Universe.
          And now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the Universe, with us as the
          cast.

We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          It's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: Can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    SNOW
          It's God.

                    SARTORIUS
          I don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    GIBARIAN
          Nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    SARTORIUS
          What if this thing follows us back
          to Earth?  What if what's happening
          here started happening on Earth, on
          a mass scale?  Don't you see that
          as a problem?  I think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  For all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

Gibarian considers this.

                    SNOW
          We're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

This time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end.

                    GIBARIAN
          Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power
          isn't that God-like.  I mean, we
          have God-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the Earth around at will.
          Maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          We intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  Of course
          it was beyond our understanding.
              (beat)
          I've come to hate it here.  There's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  Humans.

Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet,
next to Gibarian: The Young Girl.

              (from a video)
          I thought I'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  But a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          So if I am consumed by the idea
          that I am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then I am insane.
              (beat, smiles)
          You ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          Maybe life just can't be solved.

RHEYA leans into frame and kisses him.

Without even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily.

          Rheya...

                    RHEYA
          I want you inside me right now.

They make love.  It's even better than before.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya,
who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. 
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away.

This continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches
her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the
train pulls away.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Rheya enters, looks around.  She spots Kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  Their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  He approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    KELVIN
          "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

                    RHEYA
          Book?

                    KELVIN
          Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of
          it when I saw you on the train.

                    RHEYA
          My Thomas is a little rusty.

He leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Not a very happy poem.

                    KELVIN
          You didn't look very happy.

                    RHEYA
          I wasn't.

                    KELVIN
          And tonight?

                    RHEYA
          Better.

He nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each
other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  He listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

INT.  FRIEND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Another night.

Rheya is wound up.  Not drunk, something else.  She has an
odd look in her eyes.

We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    RHEYA
          You want to fuck her?

                    KELVIN
          Stop it.

                    RHEYA
          You behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.  Not here.

                    RHEYA
          And I just want to know if I'm
          crazy or not -- if what I think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          Or am I one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  Who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

                    KELVIN
          Let's go home.

                    RHEYA
          You go home.

                    KELVIN
          I am.  Please come with me.  I
          don't want to do this here.

Rheya crying as she embraces Kelvin.

He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind.

          You're better when you take them.

                    RHEYA
          I know, I know.  But still, somehow
          I don't feel better.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  How about I feel better
          when you take them?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          Right.

They look at each other and understand; she will take the
pills.

Rain streaks the kitchen window.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches.

                    KELVIN
          What do you remember?

                    RHEYA
          What do you mean?

                    KELVIN
          Do you remember Beethoven?  The
          Beatles?  Movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    RHEYA
              (thinking)
          Yes.  But not until you mentioned
          them.  As soon as you said those
          things, I remembered them.  And
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things I remember. 
          It's like filling up.

She looks out the portal at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          Is it a planet?

                    KELVIN
          Not exactly.  It exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the Universe.  An
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          It was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          We had to unlearn everything.

                    RHEYA
          Is it intelligent?

                    KELVIN
          Intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          Then it's God, right?

                    KELVIN
          It's something.

                    RHEYA
          You still don't believe in God?

                    KELVIN
          The whole idea of God was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called Man.  Even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  It
          can do this, it can do that!  It
          designs, it creates!

                    RHEYA
          Even a God that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    KELVIN
          You're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  You're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  Human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  How could we know what
          Solaris is up to, if anything?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          But what if Solaris is what there
          was before The Big Bang?

                    KELVIN
          As I said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          As I said, then it's God, right?

She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    RHEYA
          Why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

Kelvin smiles.

The intercom comes to life.

          Kelvin, you awake?

                    KELVIN

          Can you meet me and Sartorius on B

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    SNOW
          Just a little strategy session. 
          But in person this time.

Kelvin is getting ready to leave.  Rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    KELVIN
          All right?

She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Kelvin listens.  A long time.

Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a CRASHING GLASS from within.  He hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce POUNDING.

He takes a step back.  An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  It sounds like a plane is
crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

RHEYA

Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    RHEYA
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          You were trying to break down the
          door.  Do you know why?

                    RHEYA
          When I saw you were gone I got
          scared.

He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

Returning, he blanches.

Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in
front of us.

She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, what's wrong with me?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

INT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM

Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin.

                    SNOW
          He won't do it.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why do you say that?

                    SNOW
          He won't.

Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange
glances.

                    KELVIN
          This is my wife, Rheya.

She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    SARTORIUS
          We thought you'd be alone.  We want
          to talk about...

                    SNOW
          We want to talk freely.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.

Sartorius begins.

                    SARTORIUS
          I suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  We can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  Agreed?

Kelvin and Snow nod.

                    SARTORIUS
          I would like to start with
          motivation.  Why are they here?

Sartorius looks at Rheya.  She looks away.

                    SARTORIUS
          They are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          They are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    SNOW
          It's an experiment.

                    KELVIN
          No.  There's no behavior
          modification.

                    SARTORIUS
          She reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods.  She is struck by the word
"before".

                    SNOW
          The same vulnerabilities?

He nods again.

                    SARTORIUS
          A recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    SNOW
          And when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

                    SARTORIUS
          Followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    SNOW
          Are the actions of Solaris
          premeditated?

                    KELVIN
          Is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  I don't think so.

                    SNOW
          I'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    KELVIN
              (to Rheya)
          When you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    RHEYA
          Yes.
              (looks around)
          Of course.

                    SARTORIUS
          If they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    SNOW
          It's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

This is ten years ago.  Rheya enters, alone.

She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  Almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  She ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  A
moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway.  Eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    KELVIN
          Where've you been?

                    RHEYA
          I been thinking about how much I
          hate you.

She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  The light goes out.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          Yes, I remember that.  I went back
          to Lois' house and spent the night. 
          Those were dark days.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    RHEYA
          I would have these -- I don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when I was younger.  Maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  Time would just
          collapse, I would be inside time. 
          I would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  Freaky
          stuff.

                    KELVIN
          How old were you?

                    RHEYA
          Seven, eight.  So one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what I'm
          doing, and I start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that I can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    KELVIN
          What kind of look?

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    RHEYA
          Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. 
          Like I was something to be... her
          guard went up.  I was a threat. 
          Now I know why.  She was afraid
          she'd be seen.  That I would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  I think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  But that's the
          cycle, right?  I knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          I guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I know.  We don't have to
          talk about that.

Another beat.

                    RHEYA
          I remember days of just thinking
          about you.

INT.  OFFICES - DAY

Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these
images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

And they like it.

                    RHEYA
          Thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  I loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    KELVIN
          I did too.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    KELVIN
          I used to watch you undress.

As she does:

                    KELVIN
          I never tired of watching you
          undress.  Every time, it was
          exciting.  Right until... to the
          end.

A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him
leaving their apartment, angry.

ON THE PROMETHEUS

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What happened to us, exactly?

                    KELVIN
          You don't know?

Rheya shakes her head.

Kelvin just watches her.

                    RHEYA
          I remember... something burning. 
          Coffee burning.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

The rain-streaked window.

An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the
solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking.

Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

She is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this.

                    RHEYA
          You found me?

He nods.  It's coming back to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying,
but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is
crying.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Experiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in
front of her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Her eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    RHEYA
          Why did you say those things?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.  I couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in
her hand.

Kelvin kneels next to her.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

With Rheya still in his arms.

                    KELVIN
          When you said you wouldn't make
          it... I didn't believe you.  Or I
          didn't take you seriously, which is
          worse.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin holds the dead Rheya.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

Squeezing her.

                    KELVIN
          I should have believed you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they
were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting.

                    RHEYA
          I can't help feeling that I'm
          cheating when I take them.

                    KELVIN
          It's genetics.  You know this.  You
          know where it comes from.  There is
          nothing wrong with uncrossing a few
          crossed wires.

She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't
matter.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. 
Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    SNOW
          You're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  We are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  That proves that --

                    KELVIN
          -- we are not sure of that.  We are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    SNOW
          If God is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning Rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't God here?

                    KELVIN
          Not necessarily.

                    SNOW
          Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  You, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person I've ever seen! 
          This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

                    KELVIN
          Consciousness is enough, that's all
          I've saying.  Consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to convince?

Kelvin just looks back at Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It will end badly.  As inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

Kelvin doesn't respond.

                    SNOW
          Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is eating with Rheya.  Looking at her.  Desiring her.

                    RHEYA
          Do you have any idea how much I
          like fucking you?

                    KELVIN
          I think so.

                    RHEYA
          Good.  Because I want you to know. 
          I really like fucking you.

He leans over and whispers in her ear.  She smiles and leans
back.

                    RHEYA
          I like that too.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          How could she not be real?  I can
          smell her, taste her.  She does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    RHEYA
              (smiles, teasing)
          You know, I've decided: I'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole Solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  You must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          Great Big Problems all day.

He just stares at her -- he really likes this.  It's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Like I said, it's not possible.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          So, Chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

They laugh.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital.  Relaxed.  On the verge of
sleep.

                    RHEYA
          You sure say "God" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I'm putting that in my
          next report.

She smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Right.  The report.  Report and
          recommend.

They consider that.

                    RHEYA
          What does Snow think you should do?

                    KELVIN
          Snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet Earth.  This is
          hilarious: He thinks it's God, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

They smile at this.  Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's.

                    RHEYA
          Sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    KELVIN
          Well.  He doesn't think it's God,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          He's thinking: If I can figure out
          how to make it stop, than I am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be God.

                    RHEYA
          He has a point.

                    KELVIN
          He does have a point.  That's just
          not the way I'd like to see it
          proven.

                    RHEYA
          You feel sorry for Solaris, or for
          me?

                    KELVIN
          It's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          Don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: He is ruthless. 
          Unblinking in his prejudice.

                    RHEYA
          It was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

A beat.  He holds her.

                    RHEYA
          Do I really feel like... I am...?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Yes.

                    RHEYA
          I'm glad.

A beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning, slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the
dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

                    KELVIN
          Everything you pursue, you end up
          becoming disinterested in.  The
          fact that you're good at everything
          you try makes it worse.  You have a
          degree in animal science, you could
          be a terrific vet. 
          You drifted into writing and turned
          out to be a perceptive journalist. 
          Then it was politics, which seemed
          best of all, you had an actual gift
          for understanding the best pattern
          for a group of people to be
          arranged for you to achieve your
          goal.  And they didn't even know
          they were being arranged.  But you
          got bored with it, like you do with
          everything.

She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a
common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

                    KELVIN
          I don't know what it's really like,
          to not know what you want to do. 
          To not have anything that you love
          to do more than anything else.

A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her
cigarette at the moment.

                    RHEYA
              (sarcastic)
          Imagine my frustration.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep.

She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression:

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong.

                    RHEYA
          You don't love me.

                    KELVIN
          Stop.

A beat.  She looks down.

                    RHEYA
          I have to talk to you... I... I
          don't know where I came from.
              (up at him)
          Do you know?

He doesn't respond.

                    RHEYA
          If you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

Calmly:

                    KELVIN
          What are you talking about?

                    RHEYA
          That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya
          died.  Killed herself.  I'm
          different.

He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    KELVIN
          Who have you been talking to?

                    RHEYA
              (no reason to lie)
          Sartorius.

                    KELVIN
          When?  When I'm asleep?

She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but I don't know who they
          are.

                    RHEYA
          I'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          How have you lived the last ten
          years?  Did you love anyone?

A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head.

                    RHEYA
          Did you think about me?

Another beat.  He nods.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          But we fought.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Especially toward the end.

                    RHEYA
          Why did she do it?

                    KELVIN
          You... she said I didn't love her.

                    RHEYA
          Was she right?

                    KELVIN
          No.  I love you.

                    RHEYA
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          I love you, too.

If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    KELVIN
          Can you sleep?

                    RHEYA
          I don't think do.  It's not sleep;
          it's something else.  It's all
          around me.

                    KELVIN
          Those are dreams.

She falls asleep.

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    SNOW
          Gibarian was under enormous --

                    SARTORIUS
          Gibarian was helpless.  It's very
          simple: Man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          Solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    KELVIN
          Meaning Man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

                    KELVIN
          That's fantastic.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why did you agree to come here?

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
          Too tired to answer?

Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'll bet.  Is this what they sent
          you here to do?  You've lost it,
          you've gone native.

Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come.

                    RHEYA
              (to Sartorius)
          You're the coward.

                    KELVIN
          Don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    RHEYA
              (still, to Sartorius)
          I'm just as human as you.  I see, I
          hear, I touch, and I feel just like
          you do.

                    SARTORIUS
          Prove it.

                    RHEYA
          These "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  Chris loves
          me.

                    SARTORIUS
          YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

Kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    KELVIN
          Get out of here.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. 
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:

                    SARTORIUS
          Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A
          facsimile.  And she's seducing you
          all over again.  You're sick.  You
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  It's just fucking.

Kelvin backs away.

                    SARTORIUS
          There's nothing grandiose about it. 
          You've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

Sartorius turns...

                    SARTORIUS
          It'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

And leaves.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          We didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

Snow wanders toward the door.

                    SNOW
          I'm not feeling well.

He passes Kelvin and leaves.

Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya.  She seems dazed.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya is asleep.  Kelvin is talking to Snow on the
videophone.

                    SNOW
          We can liquidate the station.  Take
          the Athena back.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    SNOW
          Of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          We'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    KELVIN
          I've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  Why
          now?

                    SNOW
          Well, I think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  Certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    KELVIN
          But why is it doing what it's
          doing?  Given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          Presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    SNOW
          Perhaps it did.

                    KELVIN
          Human beings can die.

                    SNOW
          But they are human.  They certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          First they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  DNA doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  They
          build up with experience.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER

Quick glimpses of Rheya.  In several of them she is in
repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Back to Kelvin, thinking.

                    KELVIN
          They come when you sleep.

                    SNOW
          That's right.  And we all have to
          sleep, eventually.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin on the bed with Rheya.  Their eyes are closed.

We think they are asleep until:

                    RHEYA
          You don't want me.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          That's what you were saying.  I
          heard what you were saying.

                    KELVIN
          For a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  That's all I know right
          now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now,
anyway.

                    RHEYA
          I have these strange thoughts, I
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          I can't explain it.

                    KELVIN
          Neither can I.  Not any of it. 
          There's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  It's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    RHEYA
          But that's what happened before.

                    KELVIN
          Not this time.

He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    KELVIN
          Do you?

                    RHEYA
          If you're here.

They kiss again...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

Offscreen, we hear the door open.

Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  When it does:

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.

                    GIBARIAN
          Leave the light off.

A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    GIBARIAN
          I wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          I might not have had to kill
          myself.

He smiles, looking at Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          You think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  Understand
          something: I am the real Gibarian. 
          Just a new incarnation.

                    KELVIN
          What do you want?

                    GIBARIAN
          You're being tricked.  Sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  He's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on Earth.

                    KELVIN
          Can it work?

                    GIBARIAN
          It can.  Ordinary matter, like
          ours?  Not affected.  Everything
          else, disintegrates.

Kelvin registers this.

                    GIBARIAN
          What I'm saying is: Don't trust
          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    KELVIN
          I can trust Rheya.

                    GIBARIAN
          You'll end up like me.

                    KELVIN
          You're not Gibarian...

                    GIBARIAN
          No?  Who am I, then?

                    KELVIN
          A puppet.

                    GIBARIAN
          And you're not?  Maybe you're my
          puppet.  But like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  It's
          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if
          they're human!

Gibarian smiles.

KELVIN

wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:

                    RHEYA
          What's wrong?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.  He was here.

                    RHEYA
          You said he was dead.

                    KELVIN
          He is.  But he was here...

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,
some proof.  Finding none:

                    KELVIN
          He spoke to me.

Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.

INT.  LAB

Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's
body.

It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not
with him.  

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She
just looks at them.

                    KELVIN
          Are you going to take them?

She nods and takes them.

                    RHEYA
          What's happening to us?

                    KELVIN
          It's all right.

                    RHEYA
          Please don't lie.  I told you
          before, I don't know how I came to
          be here.  Whatever you think you
          can't say to me, I need to hear you
          say it.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. 
          If we're playing out what happened
          before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

                    KELVIN
          That won't happen again.  We're
          different.

                    RHEYA
          How can I tell?  You've seen both
          of me.  I only know what you're
          like here.  You're all I know. 
          There is no "You" from before.

She sits, frustrated.  Sad.

                    RHEYA
          How could it be so cruel?  How
          could it torture us like this?

                    KELVIN
          I don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  It's just watching.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Alone.

After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an
instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another
beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and
something tells him that's not a good sign.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL
STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a
passing room.

                    SNOW
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          She drank liquid oxygen.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems
very detached.

An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    KELVIN
          She's dead.

Snow says nothing.

Then:

Her finger twitches.

Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    SNOW
          She'll come back, don't worry.  But
          then what?  My theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    SNOW
          Why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  It's the most
          obvious solution: Escape.  She
          knows she can't leave here --

                    KELVIN
          Get out --

                    SNOW
          Oh, this one you love?  What about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  You didn't
          love her?

Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    SNOW
          What happens if she comes back?  Is
          that polygamy?  And even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  You think they're
          not going to notice her?

Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    SNOW
          I never get used to them, these...
          "Resurrections".

He leaves.

Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

She gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.

It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.

She begins to cry.

                    RHEYA
          What am I?  Why can't I die?

She turns away.

                    RHEYA
          I'm not Rheya.  You're always known
          that.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya --

                    RHEYA
          Don't call me that.

He turns her over.

                    KELVIN
          Listen: I don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          You are her, you are Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          I'm disgusting.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.  I'm not human.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm
          staying here with you.

                    RHEYA
          Then you'll die.

                    KELVIN
          I want every second I can get with
          you.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What will I do, if you die?

He doesn't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.

                    RHEYA
          Do you think I can get pregnant
          here?

A long beat.

                    KELVIN
          We'll know soon enough.

INSERT:

The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    RHEYA
          I can't be a mother.

She pulls back.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't do this.  I am literally
          begging you not to do this.  Chris.

                    KELVIN
          You should have told me.

                    RHEYA
          It wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    KELVIN
          Thank you.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    KELVIN
          Neither did I.

                    RHEYA
          You never said you wanted one.

                    KELVIN
          I never said I didn't.

                    RHEYA
          Chris --

                    KELVIN
          I can't stay here.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. 
          I won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Then you won't make it.

He leaves, brushing past her.

A long, held shot of Rheya, crying.  She is curled up,
retreating into herself.  Kelvin is trying to console her.

                    KELVIN
          I came back.  You have to know
          that.  I came back that night.

Kelvin and Rheya.  She is sobbing, but somewhat calmer.

          I couldn't make it, either.
              (beat)
          I'm so sorry.

As we saw him before, sitting in the chair.  But we didn't
hear him say this before:

          If they succeed, you'll never see
          her again.

In the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the
liquid oxygen:

                    RHEYA
          You're afraid of me.  I can't do
          this anymore.  I still don't
          understand.  It's not possible.

He tries to console her, but she recoils.

                    RHEYA
          Don't --

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out.  She looks
desperate.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          What do I have to do to stop it?

                    KELVIN
          I want you here.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.

                    KELVIN
          You exist here.  I keep telling
          you.

                    RHEYA
          That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Who are you, then?

                    RHEYA
          I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    KELVIN
          Yes, you are --

                    RHEYA
          Did you hear what Gibarian said? 
          I'm not a human being.  I'm an
          instrument.  I came from your
          memory and your imagination and I
          will torture you no matter what.
          Even if I remain passive.  That's
          when I drank the...
              (beat)
          I was going mad.  It felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  There was something else. 
          An illusion.  But I could feel my
          heart beating, and I remembered you
          tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly
          like mine.

                    RHEYA
          But then I would be dead now.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Is that really what you want?

                    RHEYA
          I want to stop taking those pills.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you wouldn't.

                    RHEYA
          They do something to me.  It's hard
          to think straight.

                    KELVIN
          I think they help.

                    RHEYA
          I have consciousness, but I am not
          mortal.  Don't you see why I'm
          going crazy?

                    KELVIN
          You have to remember that I love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    RHEYA
          I can't --

                    KELVIN
          It put you here.  I'll admit it, it
          acted like a God and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          I was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And
          there you were.
              (beat)
          Whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  The decision we
          make now is all that matters.  Stay
          with me.

                    RHEYA
          Am I really her?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know anymore.  All I see is
          you.

They kiss.

                    KELVIN
          Stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.

Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow.

                    KELVIN
          She knows everything.  She knows
          who she is.

                    SNOW
          She knows everything?  Does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    KELVIN
          No.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What do you want?

                    KELVIN
          I want you to get Sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    SNOW
              (feigning innocence)
          What plan?

                    KELVIN
          Just get him to stop.

                    SNOW
          What do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You
          don't believe me?  Let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  I've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    KELVIN
          Her oxygen would have run out.

                    SNOW
          Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should
          we check?

Kelvin just stares at him.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to please? 
          Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this
          one or that one.  Can you face
          both?  We are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  So: Leave with
          her.  You'll see the
          transformation.

                    KELVIN
          Into what?

                    SNOW
          You'll see her die, that's all. 
          They're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  She will die.  Then what
          will you do?

                    KELVIN
          I love her.

                    SNOW
          You do, you don't.  She's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but 
          -- this isn't the place for it. 
          Don't you see?  No, you don't.

          I'm sending you a message because I
          feel sorry for you.  I really do,
          Kelvin.
              (beat)
          It is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  You are being manipulated. 
          You are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  If she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  She is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  You provide the formula. 
          You can only finish where you
          started, remember that.

          They sold us out to the highest

Kelvin wakes up.  Rheya is beside him.  He rises and heads
for the bathroom.

He swallows two pills and a small cup of water.

When he returns to the bed, Rheya is looking at him.

                    RHEYA
          What are you taking?

                    KELVIN
          A sleeping pill.  Do you want
          yours?

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills
just beyond her hand.

BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS

Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want
the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her.

                    KELVIN
          What does it want?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  Something. 
          Anything.

She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          It created me and yet I can't
          communicate with it.  It must hear
          me, though.  It must know what's
          happening to me.  Don't you think?

          I don't think it dislikes us.  I
          think it just noticed us.  It
          lives, thinks, and acts.  We are
          dealing with a living creature
          here, no question.  And it's done
          something we've never been able to
          do: create a perfect human body. 
          Perfect except for the subatomic
          alterations, but...

          If Solaris is inside our brain, and
          it knows everything, and we're only
          consciously aware of what 2% of our
          brain is up to at any given moment,
          it knows us better than we know
          ourselves.  It's not even close.

                    RHEYA
          I've decided that if it is God,
          it's a sick God.  Its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          It's created a situation without a
          goal, and I hate that.  A God whose
          passion is not a redemption, who
          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          And us?  We would have to have "an
          arrangement".  An unspoken
          understanding that I am not human. 
          How can I not hate something that
          does that?

Breathes a sigh of relief at being home.  Everything seems
slowed down, somehow.

          I though I was home.

          Where did you go before?

                    RHEYA
          When?

                    KELVIN
          Last night.  You were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    RHEYA
          You must have been dreaming.

She begins to cry.

                    KELVIN
          What's the matter?

She just shakes her head.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya?

From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying.

Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

KELVIN

Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I'm losing my mind.

Kelvin, transfixed.

          Is this what it means to die?

          Am I in the moment of my own death?

          of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I
          return to Earth and lie about what
          happened?  Lie about having contact
          with something like Solaris?  I
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  I left
          them in the dark.  We all did.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          So why come back at all?  To see if
          she comes here?

KEVIN'S POV

Of the woods.

But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.

KELVIN

Looking from the doorway, notes this.  He doesn't seem
surprised, though.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I don't believe it will happen.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kelvin, in his bed, awake.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          But I will wait, anyway.

                                                  CUT TO:

BLACK.

Count to five.  Then:

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS)

Kelvin is in his bed, still feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He looks around the room.  He is alone.

A flashing light on his computer demands attention.

ON THE COMPUTER

A video message from Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't blame them.  I begged them to
          do it.  It's better this way.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I tried to make you think
          I was human.
              (beat)
          I read my own suicide note.  I
          found it in your things.  I
          realized I was not her.

She looks away.

                    RHEYA
          I know that you loved me, Chris.  I
          know that.
              (beat)
          I love you.

Kelvin breaks down.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him
is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is
the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem,
the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

The first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and
whispers.  This time we hear what he says:

                    KELVIN
          "Though they go mad they shall be
          sane.  Though they sink through the
          sea they shall rise again."

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kevin holding Rheya.

The note on the floor.

The rain-streaked window.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          "Though lovers be lost love shall
          not.  And death shall have no
          dominion."

Kelvin wipes the hair from her face.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          You killed her!

                    SARTORIUS (V.O.)
          Not her.  It.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius'
door.

                    KELVIN
          You murdered her!

                    SARTORIUS
          Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  She
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          She was gone.

Kelvin looks around.

                    KELVIN
          She'll come back.

                    SARTORIUS
          No, she won't.

                    KELVIN
          Why would you let her to do that?

                    SARTORIUS
          It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever
          it is, it's not human, and I am
          threatened by that.  Evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          And I want to win.  I want humans
          to win.  So I am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    KELVIN
          You fucking bastard...

                    SARTORIUS
          Whose side are you on?

Kelvin moves away.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Still turning, slowly.

But something about its appearance is different.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Complete chaos.

Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck.

                    SARTORIUS
              (yelling as he runs)
          It's changing characteristics. 
          It's solidifying taking on weight.

                    KELVIN
          How quickly?

                    SARTORIUS
          If it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.

INT.  FLIGHT DECK

Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is
sitting in his room.

                    KELVIN
              (via intercom)
          Snow!  We need you up here.

Snow doesn't reply.

                    KELVIN
          Snow!

Snow looks up.  There's a strange look on his face.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong with you?  We need
          your help.

                    SNOW
          I won't be making the trip.

                    SARTORIUS
          Snow, get up here, now.

                    SNOW
          I'm not Snow.

This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    SNOW
          I got rid of him.  I wanted to see
          if... I wanted to be the only one. 
          I wanted to be Snow.

                    SARTORIUS
          Fuck me.  I knew it.

                    KELVIN
          When did this happen?

                    SNOW
          Oh, right away.  That's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  You
          should've noticed that.  I miss
          him, though.  I think I made a
          mistake.

                    KELVIN
          Jesus...

                    SNOW
          But I can't leave with you.  I
          won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Maybe you can.

                    SARTORIUS
          You want it coming back with us?

                    SNOW
          You go ahead.  Of what I remember
          about Earth... it's all one thing
          now.  Everything's a blur.  I like
          distinctions.

Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          We do not have time to deal with
          this.  Get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the
monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Silence.

The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.

CLOSER ON SOLARIS

After the ship has gone.

A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.

Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.

Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY

Kelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain
continues.

He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Earth.
              (beat)
          What did that word mean to me?
              (beat)
          I have returned.  Finally.

Kelvin begins to walk.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I work in the city now.  After work
          I wander and lose myself.  I am
          silent and attentive.  I follow the
          current.  I make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on Earth.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will study these gestures until
          they become reflexes again.  I will
          find new interests and occupations,
          but --

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.

Kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will not... give myself.  I will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because I am haunted by the
          idea that I remembered her wrong. 
          That I shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  That I was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          What if I was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          I've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.

RHEYA

Is in the living room, waiting for him.

She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

KELVIN

Opens the door.  He cannot speak.

RHEYA

Rises and moves toward him.

They embrace.

He breathes her in.  She squeezes him.

After a long beat:

                    KELVIN
          How can you be here...

                    RHEYA
              (whispering)
          Shhhh.  Just stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.  Everything is
          forgiven.  Everything.

She sways with him, gently.  His body relaxes.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

A tableau of the cabin.  The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound.

These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.

                                                FADE OUT.

     INT.  HOSPITAL NURSERY - NIGHT

     BABIES in bassinets, isolettes, incubators.  BABIES sleeping,
     BABIES blinking, BABIES cooing, BABIES chirping, BABIES
     squalling.

     It's the SQUALLING BABIES, the ones with pinched faces and tiny
     bunched fists, that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in
     Military Uniforms.  (Their anonymity is assured by the angles
     from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are
     the backs of heads.)

     A lone NURSE watches them grimly as they make their "selections,"
     marking the cribs of the most active, noisy BABIES with X's.

     ANGLE ON VAN DOORS slamming shut on a dozen squalling BABIES in
     tiered red cribs.

     ANGLE ON THE VAN pulling away from the loading dock of the large
     hospital as a date is SUPERED over the scene...

     INT.  CAGE/BASEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

     Vicious teeth, savage snarls, tearing flesh as three fierce
     fighting DOGS battle a single WOLVERINE in large steel cage.

     The cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded
     by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in
     identical gray overalls.  As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle,
     amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears SUPERED over
     the scene...

                                1994

     WE DISCOVER in the shadows more ANONYMOUS MEN (and WOMEN), some
     of them in Military Uniforms, observing the children.

     INT.  A WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

     It's creepy:  the same children two years older, milling about a
     bare cement room, apparently unsupervised.  They ought to look
     cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly
     sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut
     hair.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene --

                                1996

     -- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR
     YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him.

     It's a harmless child's kick.  But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS,
     he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again.  And again.

     The servo-motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall
     WHINES slightly as the camera pans to the record the action.

     INT.  WINDOWLESS "CLASSROOM" - DAY OR NIGHT

     Puzzles.  Fingers fit shapes into holes.  The puzzles aren't fun
     puzzles; they're obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or
     both.  SIX-YEAR-OLDS now, the boys perform in a grim room under
     fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished
     shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles,
     observing.

     As a date appears SUPERED over this scene...

                                1998

     WE NOTICE one of the SIX-YEAR-OLDS is becoming familiar to us.
     TODD.  We NOTICE his intense eyes as he dexterously manipulates
     a puzzle.

     EXT.  FIELD - DAY

     Behind a cyclone fence topped with curlicues of razor wire, the
     boys, now TEN-YEAR-OLDS, are marching in formation under the
     supervision of a (faceless) DRILL SERGEANT.  Again a date is
     SUPERED over the scene...

     Fourteen-year-old TODD is doing bench presses in shorts while all
     around him his FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD COMRADES work out with weights
     in a very grim and spartan gym that resembles a sinister
     concentration camp more than the yuppie spas of the 20th Century.
     The date appears SUPERED over the scene...

     EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE/MONTAGE - DAY

     The FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLDS, TODD among them, jump, roll, dive, crawl,
     swim, and rappel through a brutal course featuring:

     vertical wooden walls,

     fast moving rapids,

     tangles of barbed wire,

     steep rock faces,

     and finally a jungle of dangling chains with tiny circular
     "platforms" about eight inches in diameter every ten feet.
     FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS bloody each other with pugil sticks and padded
     cudgels while they swing twenty feet above the ground.  One of
     them is knocked off, plummets downward.  CRUNCH!

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  SNOW COVERED LANDSCAPE - DAY

     Long even strides, two inches of snow.  Breathing hard, the
     SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now lope through hills and woods in shorts and 
     T-shirts, their breath coming in steamy blasts as the date is
     SUPERED over the scene...

                                2008

     This a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold
     weather, but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit, their faces
     hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes.

     Except for the STRAGGLER, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear, 
     obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling, 
     struggling to keep his feet...

     ANGLE ON A HILL where ANONYMOUS OBSERVERS, all in military dress, 
     watch.

     ANGLE ON THE STRAGGLER, unable to keep his feet, going down,
     gasping.  With fearful eyes, he looks toward the hill where he
     knows the OBSERVERS are.

     ANGLE ON THE PACK, sixteen SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS not looking back,
     even as a single SHOT rings out.  TODD doesn't even blink, just
     keeps running.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

     Suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a
     MILITARY FIGURE, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing.
     Before the weapon can flash a laser bean, AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages
     the target and it disappears back into the grass.  The boys,
     EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying
     automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall
     grass.

     Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close, 
     sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks.

     The EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS expertly mow down menacing MILITARY
     FIGURES while holding their fire when ANIMAL TARGETS or UNARMED
     CIVILIANS and CHILDREN appear.

     The eighteen-year-old on point is RILEY, a muscular redhead.
     TODD is right behind him as a date is SUPERED over the scene...

                                 2010

     Suddenly multiple TARGETS appear, charging.

     BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  First TARGET down!

     RILEY, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two 
     MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, pans for a nearby SOLDIER TARGET.  But
     the SOLDIER TARGET zips behind the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN,
     taking cover, weapon pointed at RILEY.

     For half a second RILEY hesitates!

     BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  TODD blazes away, mercilessly blowing away
     the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN TARGET and the SOLDIER TARGET.

                          THE MAIN TITLE APPEARS

     as the ROAR OF GUNS gives way to MUSIC...

     Skillful hands operate a tattoo pen, stenciling an insignia and
     a number on the left side of RILEY'S face over the cheekbone.
     His cheek says RILEY, L.B., his face reveals nothing as...

                          OPENING CREDITS BEGIN

     The next face is TODD.  The skillful hands with the tattoo pen go
     to work on his face, marking, stenciling the skin as...

                       OPENING CREDITS CONTINUE

     Then the tattoo artist's bands finish with TODD and move on to
     the next MAN, leaving TODD staring straight ahead, his cheek
     tattooed, his face like carved stone, his eyes as unfathomable as
     the eyes of a statue as THE OPENING CREDITS CONCLUDE.

     EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

     Machinegun fire, SOLDIERS in cammies moving through lush tropical 
     growth.

     A mortar explodes, a SOLDIER is engulfed in shrapnel.  As the
     smoke clears, the SOLDIER screams mindlessly like a siren.  This
     is real war, not training.

     A title and date appear on the screen, saying...

                       2011, THE BOLIVIAN WAR

     As the title fades, we glimpse TODD advancing at a crouch through
     smoke and enemy fire, blazing away at the unseen enemy.  Sweaty
     and smudged, his uniform torn and stained with blood, TODD
     reveals nothing on his stone face.  But he's clearly
     unintimidated by the death of his screaming comrade as we...

     EXT.  PINE WOODS - DAY

     Automatic weapons CHATTER as TODD struggles through thick snowy
     woods, half-carrying a bloody comrade barely recognizable as
     RILEY.  Bullets spatter bark and leaves as TODD and RILEY take
     cover behind a fallen log.  A date and title appear, SUPERED over
     the action...

                    2012, THE MONTANA "INCIDENT"

     RILEY is nearly unconscious.  TODD glances at his own wound, a
     savage opening in his side.  He considers the torn flesh as 
     dispassionately as a man checking a flea bite.

     Bullets whiz around the wounded man as we...

     Sunbaked landscape, a burning village, ENEMY CORPSES sprawled
     here and there, burned or horribly mutilated by artillery fire. 
     SUPERED over the corpses, a date and title...

                    2014-2016, THE SAUDI CAMPAIGN

     WE DISCOVER TODD, RILEY, and several OTHER SOLDIERS, exhausted,
     parched, in torn and bloodied uniforms, sharing a single canteen
     under the blazing sun.  War is hard work!

     A fury of flames, the THUNDER of ignition as huge rocket engines
     lift a space vehicle off the launching pad and propel it skyward.

     EXT.  OUTER SPACE

     Profound SILENCE!  The space vehicle that the rocket propelled is
     a weathered looking military spaceship gliding through the
     blackness of outer space like a huge shark.  A date and title
     appear SUPERED over the scene...

     A huge moon looms in the blackness above a barely visible
     landscape...

                    2020, THE ARGENTINE SECTOR

     SIX SOLDIERS stagger through the rough terrain in pressure suits
     and plexi helmets, breathing from tanks.

     Sudden automatic fire staggers the lead SOLDIER.  His helmet is
     pierced, air and blood erupt from the hole in his face plate.

     The SERGEANT, his futuristic "chevrons" on his helmet, signals
     the men to take cover, starts to return fire.  As a flare
     illuminates the battlefield, we RECOGNIZE the sergeant through
     his visor.  It's TODD.

     EXT.  EXTRATERRESTRIAL CITY - DAY

     Bombed out!  Buildings turned to rubble, smoking ruins, rain.  An
     extra-terrestrial city ravaged by war to such a degree that it
     bears an uncanny resemblance to Dresden/Earth in 1945 after the
     fire-bombing!  The architecture, even in ruins, recalls old
     Europe, and the streets are narrow, as in before (or after)
     automobiles.

     Bursts of AUTOMATIC FIRE, occasional MORTAR BLASTS.  A spooky
     battle between unseen SOLDIERS is taking place in seemingly
     deserted streets and alleyways.  And SUPERED over the gloomy
     scene...

                        THE THIRD DRESDEN MOON
                (1.16 Earth atmos, acceptable oxygen)

     CRACK!  CRACK!  CRACK!  Shots!

     Suddenly a terrified MOTHER dashes along the street, a screaming
     BABY in her arms, looking for shelter.

     A CIVILIAN MAN pops out of a doorway, pulls her to safety.

     REVEAL TODD, watching from the shell of a once proud building.

     TODD'S POV of four ENEMY SOLDIERS running at a crouch among the
     rubble.

     ANGLE ON TODD watching them scurry into a cellar door.  TODD
     turns and gives a hand signal.

     ANGLE ON RILEY twenty yards away, hidden behind exposed
     machinery, acknowledging the signal and, along with a THIRD
     SOLDIER, advancing toward the cellar.

     EXT.  CELLAR DOOR

     TODD, RILEY, and the THIRD SOLDIER converge stealthily,
     coordinating with hand signals.

     TODD pulls the pin on a grenade, and RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER
     kick in the door.

     TODD tosses the grenade in as RILEY fires a withering barrage of
     automatic fire through the cellar door.

     BAHWHOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES.

     Then, RILEY, TODD and the THIRD SOLDIER charge in.

     INT.  CELLAR

     HEAVY FIRE as TODD, RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER spray the room.

     ANGLE ON TODD signaling cease fire.

     Sudden silence.  Drifting smoke.  Then...GROANS.

     Four ENEMY SOLDIERS are sprawled motionless, horribly
     eviscerated.  A fifth ENEMY SOLDIER, horribly wounded, is
     groaning.

     ANGLE ON TODD surveying the scene, stone faced.

     TODD'S POV of the enemy dead, and several CIVILIANS equally dead,
     as well as the dead BODIES of several CHILDREN.

     BANG!  RILEY shoots the groaning ENEMY SOLDIER.

     Silence again.

     CLOSE ON TODD, his stone face.  What does he see?  What does he
     feel?  Anything?  A mystery!

     INT.  BARRACKS - DAY

     A spartan room, bare bunk-beds.  Rain POUNDS on a window that
     looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the
     Third Dresden Moon.

     TODD is sitting on a bunk, shirtless.  His new rank has been
     tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and
     another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  The names of
     various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an
     official record, not a decoration.  TODD is silent, staring into
     space.  The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts, fatigues,
     sleepwear.  WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE...

     The WORDS FADE AWAY, the silence continues, the rain BEATS on the
     barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch
     the rain beat on the windowpane.  They look like robots...used
     robots, made individual only by their different scars.

     EXT.  BARRACKS - DAY

     Rain.  Low buildings, boarded windows, slogans painted on the war-
     scarred walls, the makeshift barracks in one building, command
     quarters in the next.

     A lone figure, a MAN IN A PONCHO, hurries through the downpour,
     passing the barracks, heading for the command quarters.

     INT.  COMMAND QUARTERS

     Entering, the MAN shakes rain off his poncho.  His name is
     RUBRICK, he's thirty-five, a lieutenant.  He faces the two bored
     OFFICERS lounging in the cluttered office where outdated
     equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops
     are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups.

     The captain, CHURCH, has his feet on the desk.  He's fifty years
     old, gray and fat and soft.  The other officer, SLOAN, also a
     lieutenant, is a thirty-five year old woman, dark, moderately
     attractive, but not particularly happy.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Colonel Mekum has his "boys"
                    unpacked.  I think he wants to show
                    them off.

                                   CHURCH
                    Hmmmmph.

                                   RUBRICK
                    They look...impressive.

     INT.  "STATION" - DAY

     A NEW SOLDIER fills the frame, a perfect-looking man/boy of about
     twenty built like a linebacker, powerful looking with sculpted
     unscarred musculature.  He looks straight ahead, unblinking, and
     so does the one next to him, and the next one.  Twenty of them
     are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was
     once a station of some sort.  They don't seem to respond to the
     chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights
     leaking sixty feet above them.

     Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking
     the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright-
     eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by,
     glowing with satisfaction.

     The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of
     stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty
     earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole
     arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and
     a sense of emptiness to it.

     SLOAN walks close to the line of NEW SOLDIERS and studies one,
     her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies.  She breaks the
     long silence.

                                   SLOAN
                    Well, they're...pretty.

                                   CHURCH
                         (to Mekum)
                    What's so hot about them?

                                   MEKUM
                         (proudly)
                    Very much improved.  In every way.

                                   RUBRICK
                    This is Colonel Mekum from Q.  He's
                    their commanding officer.

                                   CHURCH
                         (dubious)
                    Improved...how?

                                   MEKUM
                    As I said, in every way.  Physically
                    and psychologically.  More
                    endurance, quicker responses, better
                    hand-eye, improved technical
                    training.  Where the First
                    Psychology gave you ninety-eight
                    percent obedience, this bunch gives
                    you 99.4.

                                   CHURCH
                         (dubiously)
                    Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old
                    daddy was in maintenance and he had
                    a saying...

     RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange an eye-rolling private glance that
     means they've heard a lot of Daddy's sayings.

                                   CHURCH
                    ...He used to say, "If it ain't
                    broke, don't fix it."

                                   MEKUM
                         (patronizing)
                    I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get
                    your...point...

                                   CHURCH
                         (indicating the
                          Veterans)
                    Well, the soldiers we've got now,
                    they've been through all kinds of
                    heavy shit...and they've always got
                    the job done.  Now these new ones,
                    these "hot shots" of yours...what
                    kind of action have they seen?  They
                    are battle-tested, aren't they?

                                   MEKUM
                    That's up to you field guys.  H.Q.
                    wants you to break 'em in when you
                    do the annual security sweep in
                    January.

                                   CHURCH
                    The sweep is just routine, not even
                    police action.  I'd like to see some
                    sort of...meaningful evidence...

                                   MEKUM
                    Such as?

                                   CHURCH
                    Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind
                    of a comparison, the old and the
                    new...

     RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a startled glance, but MEKUM doesn't
     seem fazed as we...

     INT.  "STATION" - DAY - LATER

     A WEAPON FIRING!  BUDDA!  BUDDA!  BUDDA!  The automatic weapon is
     being fired by the veteran soldier RILEY.  He's blazing away at
     an elaborate electronic target a hundred yards away in the huge
     space.

     TODD is watching with the other VETERAN SOLDIERS.  They're seated
     on the floor, wearing drab fatigues, directly across from the
     twenty NEW SOLDIERS.

     As TODD glances at them, the NEW SOLDIERS look back unblinkingly.
     (The VETERANS, in spite of their impassive expressions, look very
     human compared to the NEW SOLDIERS.  Their battle scars mark them
     as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectly-muscled young
     giants across from them.)

     The firing stops, and RILEY, his weapon empty, leaps to his feet
     and salutes RUBRICK, who's been watching the demonstration with
     the rest of the officers.

                                   RILEY
                    Sir!

                                   RUBRICK
                    Very nice, Riley.  Fall away.

                                   RILEY
                         (another salute)
                    Sir!

     As RILEY joins the VETERANS squatting motionlessly, RUBRICK
     glances at the shredded electronic target, glances at his
     stopwatch, then looks at Mekum.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Thirty seconds, 90 percent hits.

     MEKUM smirks, picks up the weapon, disassembles it rapidly.
                                   MEKUM
                    Let's make it more difficult.

     RUBRICK, CHURCH and SLOAN exchange glances of disbelief as MEKUM
     scatters the disassembled parts onto the concrete floor with a
     loud clatter.

     TODD watches, unblinking, as MEKUM looks to the NEW SOLDIERS.

                                   MEKUM
                    Caine Six-Oh-Seven!

     A blond Nordic giant is suddenly on his feet among the NEW
     SOLDIERS.  There is real dignity in his salute; he's like a pro.

                                   CAINE 607
                    Sir!

                                   MEKUM
                    Assemble the weapon, load, fire on
                    the target from various evasive
                    positions in a thirty-second period.

     OFFICERS look at each other again in disbelief.
                                   MEKUM
                    Starting...now!

     MEKUM punches his watch as CAINE 607 gracefully begins to pick up 
     pieces of weapon, doing it rapidly, yet without apparent haste.

     TODD is watching, revealing nothing.

     CLACK!  KA SHACK!  CLICK!  CAINE 607 slaps the weapon together, 
     loading a magazine with a final KA SHUCK, then he dives to the
     floor, firing a rapid burst at the electronic target which blinks 
     wildly...

     OFFICERS watch, impressed.

     CAINE 607 is firing from another position.

     The target goes crazy.

     CAINE 607 is rolling and firing at the same time.

     The target goes wild.

     MEKUM's watch clicks off 27 seconds...28...29...

     The firing stops.

     TODD stares impassively as CAINE 607 salutes.  Beside him, RILEY 
     watches also.

                                   MEKUM
                         (to Caine 607)
                    As you were, soldier.

     RUBRICK is looking at the electronic target, grudgingly
     impressed.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Ninety-nine percent...

                         (smug)
                    While taking evasive action...

                                   RUBRICK
                         (amazed)
                    That's...very good.

     INT.  WEIGHT AREA/"STATION" - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     A NEW SOLDIER cleans an awesome weight with what looks like ease
     as RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN again exchange impressed glances
     and MEKUM watches smugly.

     They're still in the giant warehouse in the gym section among all
     sorts of ominous exercise devices.  The NEW SOLDIERS and VETERANS
     are gathered in separate groups at attention, their faces like
     stone.

     TODD is watching the big man handle the weight easily.
                                   MEKUM
                    See?  Much stronger.

                    What about endurance?

     TODD is loping through sheets of rain.  The terrain around him 
     features ghostly shells of buildings, shards of a city nearly 
     invisible through the curtains of rain.

     His feet slash through flooding gutters and trash filled streets 
     bordered by ruins as he runs smoothly, evenly, keeping a good
     pace, his breath rasping rhythmically, his eyes revealing
     nothing as we...

     SLOAN accepts a cup of hot coffee from RUBRICK as she considers
     the plastic "papers" MEKUM has spread on the cluttered desk.
     Ponchos have been hung by the door.  MEKUM is pointing to various 
     numbers and paragraphs.

     CHURCH has been staring out the window into the pouring rain.  He 
     turns to MEKUM and interrupts.

                                   CHURCH
                    Our man has been out there fifteen
                    minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one?

                                   MEKUM
                         (smug grin, to Church)
                    In a minute.
                         (turning back to Sloan)
                    Now, see this test?  This shows what
                    they do under sleep deprivation
                    conditions.  Forty-eight hours awake

     EXT.  TODD RUNNING/RUINS - DAY

     Rain slashes his face as TODD runs, his eyes staring vacantly
     into the blinding storm, his legs pumping evenly, his feet
     chopping through the thick mud in a wasteland of shelled
     apartment buildings where rat-like CREATURES scurry out of his
     way as we...

     INT.  "STATION" - DAY

     Separated by fifteen yards, the two groups of SOLDIERS, the NEW
     and the VETERAN, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly
     into space as they await orders.  Occasionally a VETERAN will rub
     his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says
     anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away 
     deliberately, expressionless.  Nobody flinches when a big door
     opens and pale light streams in.

     MEKUM is standing there in a poncho.

                                   MEKUM
                    Melton, Eight Five.  Forward.

     MELTON, one of the husky new soldiers, climbs to his feet and
     steps toward MEKUM, saluting.

                                   MELTON
                    Eight Five, sir.

                                   MEKUM
                    Ten miles, Melton, on the run.

     MELTON's face shows no expression as MEKUM continues.

                                   MEKUM (O.S.)
                    You've got sixty minutes.  Go.

                                   MELTON
                    Sir!

     MELTON heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as
     we...

     TODD's breath comes in even rasps as his feet splash over rough

     In the cluttered office, RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN look up from
     a conversation as MEKUM enters dripping wet and takes off his
     poncho, smiling smugly.
                                   MEKUM
                    My man left exactly twenty minutes
                    after yours.  Make a note of that.

                                   RUBRICK
                    What are we supposed to do with the
                    old soldiers?

                    Old soldiers never die.

                    They'll serve as a labor force.  You
                    can use them for physical stuff...
                    loading, unloading, repairs, power
                    lines, that kind of thing.
                         (a glance around the
                          office)
                    Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh,

     EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY

     Breathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain.
     Something makes him glance back over his shoulder.

     Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain.

     TODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs 
     maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running.

     Then he looks back again.

     The vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer.

     TODD continues at the same even place.  He doesn't look back
     again until he feels closeness.  Then he looks.

     IT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly,
     keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's.  The bigger man
     moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD 
     weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine,
     inexorable.

     As TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming
     ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  "STATION" - DAY

     The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK,
     and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the
     muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but
     not desperately.

                                   MEKUM
                    Of course, age is a factor, but the
                    real factor is the training program,
                    especially the psychological.  The
                    mind controls the body after all,
                    and we're doing wonderful things
                    with the mind.

     A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer,
     takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at
     the same pace, his face like stone.

     TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, 
     comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes.

                                   TODD
                    Sir.

                                   RUBRICK
                    At ease, soldier.

     CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM.

                                   CHURCH
                    What's the price of all that speed?
                    Is he tired?
                                   MEKUM
                    Tired?

                                   CHURCH
                    Todd here ran the pace he's been
                    taught to run.  He's still strong.
                    Send him up the chain, Rube.

                                   RUBRICK
                         (to Todd)
                    Soldier!  Up the chain!
                                   TODD
                    Sir.

     TODD salutes and lopes toward ten chains that dangle from the
     rafters sixty feet above, grabs one, and starts up it, hand over
     hand.

     MEKUM watches TODD climb, then looks at CHURCH who is looking at
     him expectantly.

     MEKUM grins at CHURCH.

     Then MEKUM looks back at TODD, not hurrying.

     TODD is thirty feet up and climbing, passing the eight inch
     circular "platforms" or footholds in the chain every ten feet.
                                   MEKUM
                         (sharply)
                    Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!

                                   MELTON
                         (saluting)
                    Sir!

     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid-
     stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.

     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men
     struggle upward toward the rafters.

     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then
     passes him.
     MEKUM, watching, smirks.

     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow
     is knit, something's bothering him.

     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS

     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty
     feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.

     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a
     "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.

     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up,
     three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches,
     neither man reveals anything at all...

     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP

     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.

                                   CHURCH
                    What about...spirit?

                                   MEKUM
                         (as in "what's that?")
                    Spirit?
                         (...a grin)
                    Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive
                    qualities"?

                                   CHURCH
                    Whatever the latest jargon is.

                                   MEKUM
                    Much better, much higher.  For
                    example, where your old ones
                    expressed ninety percent of their
                    sexual energy in aggressive
                    physicality, these new ones are
                    ninety-nine percent without
                    sexual inclination.  It's all
                    aggression.

                                   SLOAN
                         (dryly)
                    Real men!

                                   CHURCH
                         (sharply, to Sloan)
                    At ease, Lieutenant.
                         (turning to Mekum,
                          serious)
                    What if they fought?

     A sudden silence.

     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.

     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up.
                                   MEKUM
                    You mean up there?

                                   CHURCH
                         (to Rubrick)
                    Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take
                    him.
                                   MEKUM
                    No!

     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new 
     soldiers can't fight?

                                   CHURCH
                    "No"?
                                   MEKUM
                    Not fair.  No contest.  Send two
                    more of your old ones up.

     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a
     glance.

                                   MEKUM
                    Go ahead.

     RUBRICK shrugs, turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in
     a group on the cement floor.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up
                    the chains.

     Two of the veterans, ROMERO and GOINES, leap immediately to their
     feet and climb rapidly.

     SLOAN, CHURCH, and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks 
     confidently.

     ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE.  They're still facing each other
     across the sixty foot drop.

     MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.

     ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. 
     They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.

     Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight
     motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the 
     veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.

     TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.

     ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW

     For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling
     around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.
                                   RUBRICK
                    Get him, men!

     ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he
     starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his
     grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,
     slides...

     ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM!
     MELTON hits him again, hard.

     GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with
     his free hand and with both feet.

     MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the
     face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes 
     mercilessly.

     ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold
     on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks
     up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly
     hurl ROMERO downward.

     ROMERO rockets down past TODD...

     ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the 
     cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them
     with blood.

     Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up
     again...

     ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's
     been clubbing him from behind...GOINES!
     GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, 
     swings after him.

     ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand.
     His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and
     swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.

     Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him
     hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back...

     ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a "platform" foothold on his
     chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down
     on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,
     then...

     TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one
     arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free
     hand and strangling him with the other arm.

     MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.

     ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of
     concern wrinkles his brow.

     ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders.
     MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps
     for air, but...

     GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and...

     MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips
     him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward
     even as...

     TODD goes for face with his free hand.

     SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.

     TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes.

     ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of
     MELTON's injury.

     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank
     impassive faces, RILEY among them.

     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.

     ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's
     elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of
     him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face.

     MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites 
     furiously, drawing blood.

     TODD grits his teeth in pain.

     WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow.

     TODD is losing his grip.

     RILEY watches below, his face a mask.

     MELTON bites and elbows furiously.

     TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins
     to fall and then...

     Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it
     ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand
     for twenty feet until...

     He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet
     to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of
     ROMERO's broken body below.

     Sudden silence!

     ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies
     motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body.

     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings.

     ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken.

     It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one-
     eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...
                                   MEKUM
                    GET DOWN HERE!  GET DOWN HERE ON THE
                    DOUBLE, GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE, YOU
                    MISERABLE PISS ANT STINKING SHIT FOR
                    BRAINS!

     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK lift their stunned faces from TODD to
     MEKUM who's continuing to rant at MELTON as MELTON comes down the
     chain fast...
                                   MELTON
                    COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN,
                    DOWN, YOU MISERABLE THIRD RATE
                    SHITHEAD INCOMPETENT CLOWN!

     MELTON lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet,
     landing gracefully on his feet in front of MEKUM and salutes.

                                   MELTON
                    Sir!

                                   MEKUM
                    LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG DUMB SHIT,
                    YOU'VE LOST AN EYE.  WHAT THE HELL
                    GOOD IS A GODDAMN ONE-EYED SOLDIER?
                    DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT COST TO BREED
                    YOU, YOU BIG MORON?  TO TRAIN YOU,
                    FEED YOU?

     As MEKUM turns, including all the NEW SOLDIERS in his continuing
     tirade, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK confer in low voices.

                                   RUBRICK
                    They're...fantastic!

                                   CHURCH
                         (reluctant agreement)
                    Mmmmmmm...

                                   SLOAN
                         (worried)
                    We could have a problem here,
                    couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost
                    three men...

                                   CHURCH
                    Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.
                    "Training accident."  Paperwork.

                                   SLOAN
                    What about the bodies?

                                   CHURCH
                         (turning away)
                    Incinerator.

     Turning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM
     who's still raging, indicating MELTON to the blank-faced NEW
     SOLDIERS.

                                   MEKUM
                    WHAT GOOD IS THIS MAN NOW?  WITH ONE
                    GOOD EYE!  HE'S GOT NO DEPTH PERCEPTION!
                    HE'S CANNON FODDER.  ALL HE CAN DO
                    IS WALK POINT AND TAKE THE FIRST
                    HIT.

                                   CHURCH
                         (interrupting)
                    They're very...impressive.

                                   MEKUM
                         (fuming)
                    Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn't
                    have lost an eye.

     CHURCH glances at TODD's corpse dumped over ROMERO's broken body,
     tries to assuage him.

                                   CHURCH
                    It was our best man who got his
                    eye...  Todd, a real tough one.
                    Survived police action in Montana,
                    fought in the Argentine Sector, and
                    in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing
                    of --
                                   MEKUM
                    Old news!  They're nothing at all!
                    Wait until you get these new fellas
                    into some real action.  I guarantee
                    you'll be awed.  I guarantee it.

     The NEW SOLDIERS sit impassively, the bleeding MELTON among them,
     staring right at the VETERANS.

     Not far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  FURNACES/FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT

     A rage of flame!  The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow
     fury, eight feet high.

     Two men, BURNERS, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear,
     laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing.  With
     effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly 
     consumed.  Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another
     load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN, seven feet high, looming in the 
     shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace.  It's 
     overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom.

     The BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object.

     It's ROMERO's dead body.  They haul it out of the bin and let it
     flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at
     nothing.

     The BURNERS stare at the body, exchange a blank look through
     their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward
     the flames.

     INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM/CLOSE BY

     In the near darkness, the faintest flickering light reveals two
     tangled BODIES, motionless in the confusion of refuse.  But not
     quite motionless!  A hand opens and closes!  A bloody hand!
     Fingers twitch.

     INT.  FURNACE ROOM

     ROARING FLAMES as ROMERO's body is tossed unceremoniously into the
     fire where the flames begin to consume it.

     For half a second the BURNERS watch ROMERO melt into fire, then
     they turn their backs and head back for another load.

     INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM

     BURNERS' hands reach in and haul out another corpse, GOINES,
     dragging the body right over TODD's body.

     As GOINES' shoe drags over TODD's face, TODD's eyes flicker
     stupidly.

     Then GOINES' corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin.

     TODD blinks, fighting for consciousness.  Where is he?  He moves
     his head...

     INT.  FURNACE ROOM

     The BURNERS, silhouetted by flames, feed GOINES' body to the
     furnace.

     CLOSE ON THE FLAMES as GOINES' body is consumed by raging
     flames.

     ANGLE ON THE BURNERS trudging to the bin.  They reach in blindly
     for whatever's next.  Tugging with effort, they struggle the
     clumsy object over the rim, and let it fall to the floor.  It's a 
     mattress!

     Communicating with a look, the FIRST BURNER drags the mattress
     toward the fire while the SECOND BURNER reaches again into the
     bin.

     The SECOND BURNER frowns through the visor, struggles with
     something, frowns, wrestles with it.

     Finally, with great effort, he pulls out a big carton that 
     immediately spills old magazines on him.

     Disgusted, he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse-
     littered floor toward the furnaces.

     ANGLE ON HIS FEET, as the SECOND BURNER struggles toward the
     fire, stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable
     in the flickering firelight.

     He passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it.  The sign
     says NONFLAMMABLE WASTE DISPOSAL...and the trail of blood leads
     to that bin!

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  OUTER SPACE - "DAY"

     Silence!  A vast darkness with only a few tiny lights in the
     infinite depths.

     A battered rusty spaceship glides slowly and silently into view.
     This is a GARBAGE SHIP and it looks it.  Awkward and slow and
     totally unglamorous, it moves through space like a great clumsy
     church made of steel as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  HOLD/GARBAGE SHIP - "DAY"

     As the massive doors on the underside of the ship open, light
     spills in and there is a huge ROAR as tons of debris, including 
     massive pieces of machinery, huge statues, old vehicles, and 
     numerous containers, spill out through the open bays and tumble 
     downward.  The one that says "Nonflammable Waste" on the side
     careens against the bulkhead with a THUNDEROUS sound, then
     hurtles downward.

     EXT.  JUNK MOUNTAINS/LANDSCAPE

     As debris from the ship tumbles down onto one of several huge
     mountains of junk that loom 800 hundred feet above a windswept
     terrain dimly lit by four pale suns, the bays close, and the
     rusty GARBAGE SHIP glides away.

     Still the cascade of machines and other bulky junk THUNDERS down
     the steep slopes, shattering, breaking into parts, tumbling and
     tumbling, settling here and there, while a SCREAMING WIND, very
     powerful, picks off the lighter pieces and carries them off like
     snow blowing off a mountain.

     The familiar-looking container somersaults halfway down the slope 
     where it bursts open, spilling a confusion of junk.

     Above the container, a huge drum smashes into a hunk of machinery
     and splits, oozing an awful looking liquid that spills down onto
     the contents of the container, sizzling and smoking on steel,
     eating it like acid.

     Not far from a smoking piece of steel, WE FIND TODD'S foot
     protruding from the junk heap!  It's motionless!  Acid drips and 
     hisses.

     ANGLE ON TODD, sprawled "inside" the mountain of junk, grimacing
     in pain as acid hits his exposed foot.  Trapped in the debris, 
     battered and bloody and weak, he struggles to rise, fights the
     heavy objects pinning him, fights to avoid the dripping acid.  As
     the wind SCREAMS furiously, he continues to struggle against the
     junk that pins him as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  "INSIDE" AND OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     TODD's head, caked with blood, appears from the junk like a man
     looking out of a cave.  Wind seizes at his hair furiously.

     He looks up, sees four pale suns in the sky...just as a huge
     steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose
     boulder, and TODD has to duck hastily to avoid certain death.

     As the heavy steel tumbles down the slope below him, wind plucks
     a twelve-foot I-beam from the slope next to him and whips it off
     in a frenzy.

     Holding on for dear life, TODD looks down at the ground four
     hundred feet below and sees a bleak wasteland strewn with junk
     shifting and skittering in the wind.

     He notices something and reacts.

     Far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of lines...and
     moving along one of the lines are four tiny FIGURES...they could
     be humans...but maybe not!

     For a moment TODD watches them.

     Then he starts to climb downward through the labyrinth of junk 
     "inside" the mountain, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  LOWER ON "JUNK MOUNTAIN" - DAY - MINUTES LATER

     Far down the slope, perhaps forty feet from the foot of the
     massive mountain, TODD's head pokes out of the confusion of junk
     and he looks down at the FIGURES below.

     Seen more closely, the FIGURES are more distinct, but no less
     mysterious.  Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur 
     their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape,
     apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that
     stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like "roads"
     through the wind.

     TODD watches as one of the FIGURES moves off the "road."  He's 
     trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles
     through the wind, walking almost on all fours like an ape.

     TODD watches the FIGURE moving among bits of junk until he
     locates something he wants, picks it up, and starts to struggle
     back toward the others, dragging his burden after him.

     TODD is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging
     process by these strange unearthly FIGURES as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  FADING SUNS - DUSK - LATER

     The four suns are changing color, dimming in the sky, as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  LANDSCAPE AND "JUNK MOUNTAIN" - DUSK

     Tiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along
     a cable, headed away from the junk mountain.

     At ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a
     massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of
     its great bulk.

     Peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the
     taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of
     "his" mountain.  The cable is twenty yards away in a "canyon" of
     junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed
     to the wind in order to get to it.

     He starts out from behind the transformer...

     WHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet,
     his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable, 
     struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights
     the wind, struggles toward the cable.

     Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time
     as it whistles close to his head.

     TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl "under the wind,"
     toward the taut cable, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  "STEEL HENGE" - DUSK - LATER

     Seen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing
     in the distance and the dusk.

     Following them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren 
     landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel
     thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him,
     vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must
     have crashed long ago.

     The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long
     way, it's almost dark, he's weak.

     He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort.

     He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire.

     He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right.

     Steel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery.

     Just then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto
     the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and
     makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze.

     Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire
     and get weakly to his feet.  For a moment he looks like he might 
     collapse, but he doesn't, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  LANDSCAPE - NIGHT

     At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights.

     TODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind,
     struggling along the wire, shivering.

     Every stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and
     they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing 
     something ahead.

     In the distance a faint light glows.

     TODD considers it as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

     The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded
     in a low mound of "earth" like a skylight.  Whatever is making
     the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only
     inches above the ground.

     TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange
     window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well
     as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind.

     TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten
     yards to the window and pears through it.

     TODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen
     through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of
     activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT
     SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the
     wind.

     (What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight
     between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. 
     Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking
     each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a 
     dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.)

     ANGLE ON TODD, prone on the "roof," mystified.  He's never seen 
     anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his 
     puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the
     wind.

     The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first 
     arrived has diminished to a strong breeze.

     TODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He
     looks around.

     The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled
     by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on
     the other window/skylight that glows from this strange "roof" and
     on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze...
     a MUSICAL sound.

     Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next
     window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music 
     played on an accordion.

     TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window.

     TODD'S POV through the second "window," another mysterious
     vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is
     just as puzzled.

     What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an 
     OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor,
     moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In
     the corner, another person is making a strange movement that
     seems to initiate the music...

     ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has
     given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC
     is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the
     warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the
     pillow fights.

     Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way
     past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he 
     freezes...listening!

     A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere...

     TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows.
     There's nothing visible...

     The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music
     ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything.

     Suddenly TODD understands, but he's too late...

     ROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more
     powerful than ever!

     TODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind,
     struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to
     the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed 
     violently, somersaulted helplessly...

     EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH

     WHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long
     moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons
     that aren't clear.

     Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up.

     In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of
     a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him
     from the wind howling overhead.

     TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he
     slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and 
     injured even to crawl.

     Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly
     sees something.

     Shoes!  Less than a foot from his bloody face.

     He manages to lift his head a little and look up.

     Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench
     wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and 
     JOHNNY, eight.

     Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on
     their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in
     amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps
     unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     VOICES, CONFUSION.  About fifty people are jammed into the low-
     ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once.  They are
     PIONEERS, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy,
     weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color.

     Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines,
     the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet
     around the eyes from squinting.

     As they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who
     found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman,
     HAWKINS, is standing behind a table in the front of the room,
     calling for order.

                                   HAWKINS
                    Please!  Quiet, please!

     Just as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named
     SLADE bellows loudly at her.

                                   SLADE
                    Just tell me one thing!  How many of
                    them are there and are they armed?

     HAWKINS stares SLADE down, refusing to speak until she has real 
     silence.  When she finally speaks, her voice is calm and
     controlled.

                                   HAWKINS
                    There in a man...one man.  He was
                    found in the trench by several
                    children...

     A sudden murmur dies away quickly under HAWKINS' hard stare.
                                   HAWKINS
                    This man was not armed.

     A murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named ELISE
     speaks over the hum of voices...

                                   ELISE
                    How could there only be one?  How
                    could he get here?

     HAWKINS glances toward MACE, a muscular, bearded man, about
     thirty.

                                   MACE
                    He was unconscious.  We couldn't ask
                    him anything.  He --

     A commotion in the back room causes MACE to break off as JIMMY
     PIG, a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes
     his way in, followed by four more PIONEERS.  All five of then are 
     wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange Eskimo-type wind
     goggles, and carrying weapons.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                    Nothin' out there.  We couldn't see
                    nobody, couldn't see no ship, no
                    vehicles, nothin'...plus the wind's
                    up again real strong.

     An excited hubbub.  HAWKINS is trying to restore order when SLADE
     shouts over the commotion.

                                   SLADE
                    They're hiding, I bet.

     HAWKINS ignores him as she speaks with firm authority.

                                   HAWKINS
                    Let's everybody calm down right now!
                         (beat; silence; then)
                    We have an injured man among us.
                    One man.  A traveler.  Unarmed.
                         (another pause; then)
                    We all want to do the decent thing.
                    The decent thing is to help him.
                    Mace's wife, Sandra, is looking
                    after him now.  Now, I'd like a vote
                    of support on this course of action
                    from all of you.

     The way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and,
     in fact, PIONEERS are exchanging glances and nodding when SLADE
     shouts again.

                                   SLADE
                    You keep an eye on him, Mace!  You
                    watch him!

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

     TODD is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom.  He
     stares stupidly at the woman bending over him.  She is SANDRA, a
     woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous
     way.  It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and 
     dignity.  She's wiping away blood and grease from TODD's face.

     TODD's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless.

     He sees a window high on one wall.

     He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned
     material hung here and there for decoration.

     Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls.

     He doesn't see the look in SANDRA's eyes as she discovers the 
     savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his
     cheek.  Eyeing these telltale marks, SANDRA pours liquid into a
     spoon and holds it to his lips.

                                   SANDRA
                    Want to try some more of this?

     TODD swallows weakly.

     SANDRA smiles, stands up, moves toward the door.

                                   SANDRA
                    You rest now.  I'll give you more
                    later.

     TODD watches her exit.

     He hears her VOICE in the next room...a low murmur.

     He's looking around again when a NOISE makes him look back toward
     the door.

     A two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees.  The
     baby boy, NATHAN, stops just inside, seeing TODD in the bed.

     NATHAN looks into TODD's eyes with childlike interest and wonder.
     TODD meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes.

     INT.  "LIVING ROOM"

     A second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the
     Mace/Sandra/Nathan living quarters.  MACE and SANDRA are deep in 
     conversation.

                                   MACE
                    What do you mean he's survived
                    worse?  Did he say something?

                                   SANDRA
                    No, but he's covered with old
                    wounds, all sorts of scars.  Knife
                    scars, bullet scars, burns.

                                   MACE
                         (worried)
                    A soldier!

                                   SANDRA
                    There are words on his shoulder.
                    Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine
                    Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai
                    2012...

                                   MACE
                    The Tannhauser Gate was a battle...

     MACE and SANDRA look into each other's eyes, very worried.
     Then...

                                   SANDRA
                    We'll have to sleep on the floor.

                                   MACE
                         (suddenly alarmed)
                    Where's Nathan?

     MACE is looking around.  He spots the open door to the bedroom, 
     hurries to it, and disappears.

     SANDRA starts after him, looking worried...but before she gets to
     the door, MACE reappears with NATHAN safely in his arms.

                                   MACE
                    If there's any danger to Nathan --

                                   SANDRA
                         (interrupting grimly)
                    I won't permit danger to Nathan.

     MACE and SANDRA lock eyes in firm understanding as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  WAR SHIP - "DAY"

     EXPLOSION!  SCREAMS!  SMOKE!  A SIREN!  We're in some kind of war
     ship in outer space during a battle.

     The interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine, cramped
     even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are
     awful as SOLDIERS in bulky space suits stumble through thick
     smoke while a SIREN WHOOPS urgently and wounded SOLDIERS scream
     in agony.

     WHOOOOM!  Another EXPLOSION!  SCREAMING METAL!

     Part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind,
     ripping SOLDIERS out of the hole into space..

     We FOCUS ON a soldier in a space suit who's wedged himself behind
     a cannon.  As we look closely at his visor, we recognize TODD
     who's firing back at the enemy while all around him SOLDIERS are
     screaming and dying as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

     SUDDEN SILENCE!  TODD blinks awake.  He looks around.

     It's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high 
     window.

     He can hear SOUNDS...LAUGHTER...coming from beyond the door.

     INT.  OTHER ROOM

     NATHAN is wobbling forward with wide eyes as MACE holds one of
     his hands and SANDRA holds the other.  They're teaching the child
     to walk, encouraging each step.  But when they let go, NATHAN
     totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass.
     MACE and SANDRA laugh, making the whole thing a game, and NATHAN, 
     after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter.  It's a warm 
     moment until SANDRA, sensing a presence, turns toward the
     bedroom, suddenly serious.

     MACE follows her look.

     TODD is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door
     frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg
     heavily bandaged.

                                   SANDRA
                         (nervous)
                    You must be...you must be feeling
                    better.

     TODD says nothing.  His eyes flick to NATHAN.

     MACE is watching TODD sharply.

                                   MACE
                    We're teaching the boy to walk.

                                   SANDRA
                         (nervously filling silence)
                    He's late learning.  He was sick for
                    a long time.

     TODD says nothing.  His eyes follow MACE who's gone to the corner
     where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon.

     TODD tenses.  Ready.  Dangerous.

     As MACE turns toward him, MACE doesn't notice the danger in
     TODD'S eyes.

                                   MACE
                    I got something for you.

     He innocently approaches with the metal rod.

     Super alert, TODD watches MACE hold the rod out to him.

                                   MACE
                    Here.

     TODD looks mistrustful.

                                   MACE
                    Like this.

     MACE demonstrates, using the rod like a cane.
                                   MACE
                    See?

     Expressionless, watches MACE use the cane.

                                   MACE
                    Practice with it.  In a day or two
                    maybe you'll be strong enough to go
                    out to the garden with Sandra.

     MACE never even realizes how much danger he was in.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     TODD's heavy boots come close to NATHAN, the cane clumps down,
     just missing him.

     NATHAN looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder
     at TODD who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help
     of a cane.

     TODD looks down at NATHAN.  Their eyes meet for a moment.  TODD
     is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear.

     SANDRA answers a KNOCK at the door, opens it, revealing ELLEN,
     the ten-year-old, in the doorway.  Behind her are JOHNNY and
     WILL, as well as several other CHILDREN of various ages.

                                   ELLEN
                    I came for Nathan.

     But ELLEN's eyes are on TODD and so are the others crowding
     behind her to peep over her shoulder.  They all want to get a
     look at TODD, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat 
     shyly.

     SANDRA is wearing a parka too.  She picks up NATHAN from where
     he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving
     him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN.

     NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as
     ELLEN hugs him and comforts him.

     TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and 
     soothe his fears at being separated from his mother.

     Nothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate
     him.

     As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over-
     the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD.

     Just then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the 
     bedroom and heads for the door.

                                   MACE
                    Let's go.  Come on, Sergeant.

     MACE is heading out the door as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

     Single-file, a dozen PIONEERS move along a trench as the wind
     SCREAMS overhead.

     We DISCOVER the cane and boots of TODD among them.  The MAN in
     front of TODD glances back at him occasionally, curious, while
     MACE and SANDRA walk behind him.

     As they pass huts, there are windows high in one sloping wall of
     the trench.  TODD doesn't notice the distorted faces of the
     CHILDREN peering out at him, their noses pressed against the 
     plexiglass, full of curiosity as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  A JUNCTION OF TRENCHES - DAY

     Three trenches meet.  Some of the PIONEERS move off to the left,
     some to the right.  MACE is going left, but SANDRA guides TODD
     toward the right with her.

                                   SANDRA
                    This way...

     MACE gives her a wave.  He waves at TODD too.  TODD looks
     confused at the wave, then he salutes.

     MACE is startled by that.  He sort of grins as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  GARDEN - DAY - LATER

     A nasty little snake, a ten-inch VIPER, slithers through the dirt 
     among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until...

     SQUASH!  One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel
     decapitates the VIPER.

     SANDRA flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel 
     clean in the dirt as TODD watches with those blank snake eyes of
     his.

     They're on all fours in a garden.  The garden is simply a much
     wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated.
     There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing.  Behind
     them, kneeling PIONEERS are planting new seedlings and weeding
     around more mature plants.

     SANDRA turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an
     offhand glance at the dead VIPER.

                                   SANDRA
                    You have to watch out for them.
                    They probably wouldn't kill someone
                    your size, not if you were healthy
                    anyway.  But they'd make you pretty
                    sick.  Someone smaller...like me, or
                    a child...

     Her meaning clear, SANDRA continues to demonstrate to TODD how to 
     plant the seedling in the earth.

                                   SANDRA
                    In a month this one will be as big
                    as those.

     TODD follows her look to the other side of the trench where the
     plants are already eighteen inches high.

     Other PIONEERS, working on their hands and knees also, are
     sneaking glances as TODD, among them, a middle-aged woman named
     JUDITH and an older woman, EMMA.

     SANDRA frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects 
     another seedling from a tray and hands it to TODD.

                                   SANDRA
                    Here.  You try one.

     TODD looks at it.  He doesn't exactly look scared, but he handles
     it gingerly, seemingly intimidated by the delicate seedling.  He 
     starts to plant it carefully as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  DINING COMMONS - EVENING

     Jabbering VOICES, the click of utensils.  Heaping plates of food
     are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal
     style.  JOHNNY is kicking ELLEN under the table, WILL flips a
     piece of food at TOMMY when his mother, ILONA, isn't looking, and
     the outspoken SLADE is lecturing a pioneer named CHESTER.

                                   SLADE
                    You can't talk to a soldier no more
                    than you can talk to a...a...bomb!
                    Or a bullet!  They're trained,
                    they're killing machines.  They got
                    an objective and they go after that
                    objective and nothing stops them but
                    killing them.

                                   CHESTER
                         (a glance over his
                          shoulder)
                    Just one?  To kill us all?

     The conversation gets the attention of JOHNNY and WILL who stop
     food-fighting to listen to the adults talk.

                                   SLADE
                    First off, if there's one, there's
                    more.  That's how it is, soldiers
                    travel in bunches.  Second, they
                    don't waste soldiers on folks
                    like us, that's for police!  Training
                    soldiers to kill weaklings like us
                    is not what they call "cost
                    effective."

                                   CHESTER
                    Then who do they fight?

                                   SLADE
                    Other soldiers!  There's a saying,
                    "Soldiers deserve soldiers."

     ANGLE ON ILONA noticing WILL and TOMMY listening.

                                   ILONA
                    Slade, hush up.

     ANGLE ON TOMMY and WILL glancing toward the next table.

     ANGLE ON THE NEXT TABLE where TODD, wedged between SANDRA and
     MACE, is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as 
     people jabber all around him.

     ANGLE ON JUDITH whispering to EMMA at a nearby table as she
     watches TODD eat.

                                   JUDITH
                    You see how much he's eating?

     ANGLE ON SLADE who turns now and boldly addresses TODD across the
     gap between the tables...

                                   SLADE
                    I don't see how you can not remember
                    how you got here, Sergeant.

     There's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few
     urgent whispers and a cough.

     TODD looks up from his food and meets SLADE'S look.

     SANDRA scowls at SLADE as SLADE persists...

                                   SLADE
                    You're not a deserter, are you...
                    Sergeant?

     The silence is even more charged than before.

     SANDRA looks alarmed.  Someone coughs.  The tension is
     unbearable.

                                   TODD
                    No, sir.

     A sigh of relief from everybody!  But SLADE presses on.

                                   SLADE
                    Then how come you're not with your
                    unit?

                                   JIMMY PIG
                    Oh, come on, Slade, let the man eat.

                                   SLADE
                    It's not an unreasonable question.
                         (to Todd)
                    How about it, Sergeant?

     ON TODD, actually struggling with the question...
     remembering.  Suddenly he blurts...

                                   TODD
                    I was...replaced.

                                   MACE
                    Replaced?

     TODD hesitates for half a second before answering.

                                   TODD
                    By a better soldier, sir.

     There are looks exchanged among the PIONEERS as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

     A little seedling is fitted into the earth gently.  TODD's strong 
     hands pat the earth around it.

     TODD reaches for another seedling.  He's one of a group of ten
     PIONEERS, all on their hands and knees, all working intently, 
     silently.  They seem to have accepted him.  Nobody stares.

     TODD is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when
     something causes him to look up.

     Five ENEMY SOLDIERS in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over
     him, weapons pointed at him.  All around them is a desert of sand
     stretching forever under a baking sun.

     One of the soldiers kicks TODD.

     ANGLE ON EMMA, JUDITH, and several other PIONEER WOMEN exchanging
     nervous glances as they look back to where TODD's kneeling.

     There are no soldiers...but somehow, he's trampled several rows
     of seedlings.

     TODD looks toward them, confused, disoriented by his "memory."

     The women look away quickly, frightened, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  OTHER ROOM - NIGHT

     SANDRA is changing NATHAN's diaper as she chatters, her back to
     TODD.

                                   SANDRA
                    ...And it got worse and worse.  My
                    father hadn't had any work in three
                    months and...also...there were other
                    things...violence...  political
                    feelings.  My father said he'd heard
                    it was better in the Trinity moons.
                    A lot of other people must have had
                    the same idea because the ship was
                    jammed with people...mostly
                    families.  That's probably why it
                    broke down...  overloaded.

     Across the room, TODD, wearing a T-shirt and baggy pants is
     sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever.

     As SANDRA talks, her back to him, TODD's eyes are on the contours
     of her body against the shift she's wearing.  It's very...erotic.

                                   SANDRA
                    Even after they made the repairs, it
                    barely got off the ground, it was an
                    old converted mining transport, a
                    piece of junk to start with.  It
                    just...dropped.  Maybe you saw
                    what's left of it...out there in the
                    wind.  A lot of people died.  And we
                    couldn't make any radio contact...
                    So we were stuck here.  Nobody was
                    happy about it.  A few years later,
                    when the dumpers started coming over
                    and dropping stuff, people tried to
                    get their attention with explosions
                    and fires.  But it didn't work.
                    They must be unmanned...or they just
                    don't care.  Maybe they think we're
                    garbage too!

     TODD'S face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the
     shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce.

                                   SANDRA
                    So there really wasn't any choice.
                    People had to pull together and make
                    the best of it.  We became a...
                    community.

     As SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN, TODD catches glimpses of her breasts 
     pushing against the material of the shift.  She continues, still
     not noticing where his attention is.

                                   SANDRA
                    One good thing...nobody bothers us.
                    Who'd want to fight over a
                    godforsaken place like this?

     A wry laugh.  She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and
     catches TODD's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her
     breasts.

     For a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers.

                                   SANDRA
                    I guess that's what you like!  The
                    fighting, I mean.  The wars.
                         (unsure, a question
                          really)
                    You must...you're a soldier...

     TODD doesn't answer as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY

     The CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway, watching something in
     the meeting room.

     HAWKINS, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the
     CHILDREN ahead.

                                   HAWKINS
                    You children are supposed to be
                    doing lessons.

     The CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them.
     She looks at what they're looking at.

     What they're seeing through the doorway is TODD, shirtless, doing
     an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises.  His muscular body
     ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks
     eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of 
     stitches, the puckered patches of burns.

     HAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried.

     In the midst of a slow graceful movement, TODD suddenly whirls
     and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing
     speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all
     too obvious.

     Even as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently, TODD returns to
     the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that 
     preceded the deadly thrust.

     The CHILDREN's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape.

     HAWKINS shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud
     to the children.

                                   HAWKINS
                    Lessons.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  INSIDE TRENCH - NIGHT

     It's dark, the wind's HOWLING just above the trench walls as TODD
     peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench.

     TODD'S POV THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW reveals a tender moment
     between MACE and SANDRA as they enter the bedroom and kiss.  A 
     flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates 
     their shadows.

     ANGLE ON TODD, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away.

     Light spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as TODD 
     begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until
     he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze
     of dark trenches.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  BARREN WASTE - DAY

     Stillness!  No wind!  Everything is quiet.  Bits of junk are
     strewn across the landscape under the four suns.

                                   MACE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    She's down now, but she'll come up
                    again.  Always does.

     EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH

     As MACE continues talking to TODD, he loads the pockets of his
     heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal.

                                   MACE
                         (continuing)
                    That's why we're weighing down.  And
                    that's why we're always on the wire
                    even when the wind's down, like now.
                    You don't get much warning.  Here,
                    load up, you'll want the weight, I
                    promise.

     MACE hands heavy hunks of metal to TODD who's wearing a parka
     like MACE'S.  He pockets the metal obediently.

     Behind them a small crowd of PIONEERS are doing the same:  JIMMY
     PIG, SLADE, CHESTER, RED, a woman named SALLY and several OTHERS.
     In addition to the parkas, they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors
     and carry canteens, tools, and coils of rope attached to various
     parts of their outfits.

     ANGLE ON MACE noticing TODD eyeing the rifle JIMMY PIG is
     carrying.

                                   MACE
                    Oh, we're not going to shoot
                    anything.  That's not what we mean
                    by "hunting."
                         (then, laughing, to
                          Jimmy Pig)
                    Jimmy Pig, you're not going to shoot
                    anything, are you?

                                   JIMMY PIG
                         (laughing)
                    What could I hit?

                                   MACE
                         (to Todd)
                    It's how we call for help.  Two
                    shots.  There'll be someone on duty,
                    listening in case we get off the
                    wire and get lost or something.  We
                    have flares too.  Come on.

     Other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the
     surface above as MACE urges TODD to follow.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  "STEEL HENGE" - DAY

     It's very still, no wind.  The little group of PIONEERS is moving
     along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the
     wrecked spaceship.  They are tiny figures in the vast landscape.

     CLOSER ON TODD AND MACE as they plod along in the line of
     PIONEERS.  MACE indicates the wreck off to the right.

                                   MACE
                    Sandra said she told you how we
                    wound up here.  Our parents and so
                    on.
                         (turning left,
                          indicating)
                    Over here, we call these "catcher
                    trenches."

     TODD follows his look to a long open trench leading, apparently, 
     nowhere.

                                   MACE
                         (continuing)
                    Smaller stuff that blows across the
                    ground, it falls in these trenches,
                    it works sort of like a filter.  We
                    go through the trenches sometimes
                    and get some good stuff.

     As they pass close along the trench,  TODD looks in and observes
     the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts
     and assorted junk protruding.

     MACE chuckles at the sight.

                                   MACE
                    We try to work 'em when they're dry.
                    It's lousy going in there when
                    they're flooded.  You can see...

     A sudden SHOUT, "HEYYUP!  YO!" distracts them.

     TODD looks forward, sees RED pointing to a chunk of steel a
     hundred yards off the wire.

     ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG, already fastening his safety rope and a
     second rope to the wire, then heading off toward the piece of
     steel, trailing the two ropes.

     ANGLE ON MACE, explaining the procedure to TODD.

                                   MACE
                    Whatever looks useful, if we can get
                    a rope to it, we'll go for it.  But
                    you can't ever go further than your
                    safety line because it'll come up on
                    you with sometimes maybe ten seconds
                    or even less.

     TODD is watching JIMMY PIG as he approaches the piece of steel
     and starts to attach his rope to it.

                                   MACE
                    Like right now.  You hear that?

     TODD listens.

     Nothing at first...then a very faint WHISTLING.  The sound he
     heard that first night when he was on the settlement "roof."

                                   MACE
                    It's close when you hear that.

     TODD can see JIMMY PIG.  He's attached the rope to the steel and
     he gives a signal.

     As PIONEERS start to haul on the line, pulling the steel toward
     them, MACE shouts at JIMMY PIG.

                                   MACE
                    SHE'S GONNA BLOW, JIMMY.

     JIMMY waves, starts back toward them.

     MACE indicates for TODD to help haul the steel and the two of
     them are just joining in the effort when...

     WHOOOOOOOOOO!  THE WIND IS SUDDEN AND FEROCIOUS!  IT STAGGERS
     THEM!

                                   MACE
                    GRAB ON, SERGEANT!

     TODD follows MACE'S example and, like the others, grabs the wire
     and hangs on as the wind SCREAMS and tears at them.

     One of the pioneers, CHESTER, shouts, points.

     They all see JIMMY PIG being blown faster than he can run, his
     legs churning desperately to keep up with his wind-propelled
     body.  To no avail!  He's suddenly airborne, his legs still
     churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of
     his safety tether like a kite, fifty feet in the air.

     An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past, tumbling in the wind.
     Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles.

     ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, crouched low on their knees against the
     wind, clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on JIMMY
     PIG'S safety line.  But the wind is too strong...until suddenly
     TODD is pulling, and TODD'S strength makes the difference...
     slowly JIMMY PIG is pulled toward them...and Pioneers exchange
     amazed glances at TODD'S strength.

     As he pulls, TODD notices what the others don't...

     ANGLE ON THE RIFLE dropped by JIMMY PIG, ten yards away.

     ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG as he's hauled safely in to the group of
     PIONEERS who clap him on the back and hug him.  CHESTER is
     laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe
     and mimic JIMMY'S desperate effort to outrun the force of the
     wind...

                                   CHESTER
                         (shouting, guffawing)
                    JIMMY...RUNNING...CAN'T...HA HA
                    CAN'T...KEEP UP WITH HIMSELF...
                    HA HA HA...

     CHESTER breaks off, suddenly sober, staring off, and the others
     turn to see what he's looking at.  Everybody stops laughing.

     ANGLE ON TODD, carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve
     the rifle!!!  The WIND is dropping off some, enough to stand.

     ANGLE ON MACE and the other PIONEERS reacting with alarm at the
     sight of TODD picking up the rifle.

     ANGLE ON TODD as he turns, rifle in hand.

     TODD'S POV of the PIONEERS staring at him, the WIND diminishing 
     further.

     ANGLE ON TODD looking toward them.  Nothing shows on his face.

     ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour.  Trouble!  Just what he expected.

     ANGLE ON MACE, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward
     TODD, holding out his free hand for the rifle...

                                   MACE
                    Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a
                    lot...

     But MACE breaks off, realizing that TODD'S attention is
     elsewhere.

     TODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape.

     MACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODD'S looking at.

     ANGLE ON THE "JUNK MOUNTAINS" in the distance, several miles off, 
     where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient DUMPER
     SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the
     junk heaps far below.  The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling
     onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind.

     CLOSE ON TODD, as realizes how he got here.

     ANGLE ON MACE, reacting to TODD'S intense interest.

                                   MACE
                    Dumpers.  They come every twenty or
                    thirty days.

     As TODD turns and looks at MACE, MACE puts out his hand again for
     the gun.

     TODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time.
     Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to MACE...

     As MACE casually takes the weapon, the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of
     relief, grinning again as the tension eases.

     TODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP, fascinated.  So 
     that's what they did to him!

     Just then, JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                    Thanks, partner.  These no-goods
                    woulda just let me blow away.

     TODD, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at JIMMY PIG
     like what was that?  Are you hitting me?

     But all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial
     manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an
     attack.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  OFFICE (OTHER WORLD) - NIGHT

     A CHRISTMAS TREE!  The corny little tree with plastic needles,
     blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a
     foot high.  It's sitting on CHURCH's cluttered desk next to
     framed photographs of CHURCH's wife and children.  We can hear
     MEKUM's voice badly transmitted...

                                   MEKUM (V.O.)
                    Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of
                    outer space on Christmas Eve, but
                    I'm off to the Caribbean in a few
                    hours, and I wanted to make sure
                    you'd got the transmission on the
                    security sweep.

     Glowering at the monitor where MEKUM's badly transmitted VIDEO
     IMAGE is quivering and distorting, CHURCH waves the print-out map
     he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots 
     against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space. 
     RUBRICK and SLOAN watch as CHURCH addresses MEKUM's image 
     indignantly.

                                   CHURCH
                    We got it all right.  This is an
                    outpost here, not the Third Army!
                    You've got us securing thirty-four
                    locations and erecting monitor units
                    in one month and --

                                   MEKUM
                         (interrupting)
                    Piece of cake, guys!  These are
                    totally remote, totally uninhabited
                    territories.  All you do is set
                    down, send out a patrol purely as a
                    formality, then have those veterans
                    of yours put up an A-Type unmanned
                    monitoring unit.  You should be on
                    about number twenty-five by the time
                    I get back from my vacation...

                                   CHURCH
                    What if we do run into people...
                    say squatters or refugees?

                                   MEKUM
                         (a frown)
                    Well, you sure as hell don't want to
                    get involved in evacuating people
                    and that sort of thing.
                         (then, meaningfully)
                    My advice would be to..."avoid
                    paperwork."

                                   CHURCH
                    Eliminate them, you mean.
                                   MEKUM
                    Well, no one's out there, but
                    officially these are "hostile
                    zones."  Therefore you'd be within
                    your rights to classify anyone as
                    "hostile," I think.
                    But I repeat, you should be worried
                    about boredom, not action.  Any
                    other questions before I go?

     CHURCH hesitates.  SLOAN and RUBRICK look at him.  Then CHURCH
     blurts a question, his voice breaking...

                                   CHURCH
                    Down there...is it snowing?

                                   MEKUM
                         (a smirk)
                    Not in the Caribbean.  Have a good
                    Christmas, guys.  See you when I get
                    back.

     MEKUM'S IMAGE disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving
     a glum silence broken only by the DRUMMING of the rain on the
     roof.

     CHURCH moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the 
     photographs.

     His wife and children smile back at him from the pictures.

     Just then SLOAN taps him, and be turns to see her handing him a
     cup full of amber liquid.

                                   SLOAN
                    Merry Christmas, Captain.

     RUBRICK is pouring another glass from a bottle of Scotch as the
     little tree winks on and off, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

     Silence.  Darkness.  Dim shapes in the darkness, hard to
     distinguish.

     Rain BEATS on the roof monotonously, relentlessly.

     The room is alive with BREATHING.

     Then we hear a MUFFLED WHOOP from outside.

     The darkness is tense, the BREATHING changes rhythm.

     The RATTLE of the door breaks the quiet.

     The door swings open, a flashlight stabs the dark.

     A woman GIGGLES:  SLOAN!

     The flashlight beams and wavers in the darkness, catching brief
     glimpses of the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS.  Their eyes glitter in
     the lurching beam, their faces are ghostly like vampires.

     RUBRICK switches on a dim overhead lamp as he and SLOAN (holding
     the flashlight) and CHURCH stagger drunkenly into the bunkhouse, 
     carrying a couple of half-empty bottles.

                                   SLOAN
                    Hi, fellas.  At ease!

                                   RUBRICK
                    Merry Christmas, everybody.

     Eyes riveted on the THREE OFFICERS, the NEW SOLDIERS are
     unresponsive to Christmas cheer.  In fact, they look almost
     angry, like big dangerous animals, as the three OFFICERS stagger 
     stupidly down the row of bunks, every eye following them.

                                   CHURCH
                    We brought you a little Christmas
                    tree.

     CHURCH almost falls over as he places the tree on the floor

     As stone faces watch him without expression, RUBRICK waves a
     couple of bottles.

                                   RUBRICK
                    And some good cheer.

     SLOAN, giggling, does a provocative bump and grind.

                                   SLOAN
                    How about some Christmas pussy,
                    guys?  Anybody for a quick piece?

     The NEW SOLDIERS don't react.  Stone faces.
                                   RUBRICK
                         (smirking)
                    That's "conduct unbecoming," Sloan.

                                   SLOAN
                    It's Christmas!  Haven't you heard
                    of piece on earth?  "Piece on
                    earth," get it?

                                   CHURCH
                         (suddenly serious,
                          sober)
                    Christ, I wish we were on Earth.

     RUBRICK sets three bottles down and indicates them to the NEW
     SOLDIERS.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Eat, drink, and be merry, men.  For
                    tomorrow you go on patrol in the 
                    "hostile zone."

     RUBRICK burps stupidly as the NEW SOLDIERS stare back at him from 
     their bunks, muscles bulging, eyes glittering, nothing but danger
     in their stone faces as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  PIONEER MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     "JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE ALL THE WAY."  In sharp
     contrast to the gloom of the soldier Christmas, the PIONEERS,
     MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, are SINGING and celebrating.

     There's a six-foot carved wooden tree festooned with makeshift 
     decorations and ringed with heaps of presents in crude wrapping.

     There's an appetizing looking buffet and a punchbowl.

     ANGLE ON TODD seated against a wall not far from the door.  He
     stares uncomprehendingly at the merriment all around him.  What
     on earth is going on?  What are they doing?

     JIMMY PIG is marching around in a Santa Claus costume, doling out
     presents to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY and OTHER CHILDREN.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                    HO HO HO!  HO HO HO!

     Passing TODD, JIMMY PIG acknowledges him with a wink and a
     special "HO HO HO."

     TODD'S eyes give away his confusion.  What the fuck is this?
     JIMMY PIG in a fake beard and a fake stomach?  This is the
     craziest shit TODD has ever encountered.

     ANGLE ON NATHAN, a wrapped present in hand.  He hasn't a clue
     what it is or what he should do with it.

     Laughing, MACE and SANDRA hover over him, showing him how to pull
     the wrapping off.  Great idea!  NATHAN likes pulling wrapping
     off!  That's fun.  SANDRA and MACE watch joyfully as NATHAN tears
     at the wrapping enthusiastically.

     ANGLE ON TODD getting to his feet.

     ANGLE ON NATHAN pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a
     pull toy, a METAL BIRD on crude wheels made of wire and junk.

     MACE takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it.  The wings flap as
     the wheels turn!

     NATHAN reacts with delight and amazement!  Then grabs it!

     A SUDDEN SCREECH...

     ANGLE ON TODD looking alarmed.  He's on his way to the door, but
     EMMA is charging at him, SHRIEKING!!!

     Not sure whether this is an attack or not, TODD watches the older
     woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still SHRIEKING giddily.

     As TODD eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a
     peck on the cheek and points over head.

     TODD looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it
     that says "MISTLETOE."

     Means nothing to TODD.  There's a burst of applause as EMMA
     scrambles off the stool.  Somebody starts to sing "GOD REST YE
     MERRY GENTLEMEN."

     A MONTAGE OF FACES:  JIMMY "SANTA" PIG, MACE, SANDRA, RED,
     CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING.

     ANGLE ON THE DOOR.  No sign of TODD!  Gone!

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  "ROOF" - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

     A low wind MOANS and mingles with strains of "OH, HOLY NIGHT" as
     TODD bellies up to the "skylight" and peers down at the scene
     below in the Meeting Room.

     TODD'S POV THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT.  The merriment has evolved into
     a more spiritual mood as the PIONEERS join in the solemn hymn.

     But TODD spots NATHAN trying to pull his pull toy along so the
     wings flap.  NATHAN is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and
     starts to cry.

     Immediately SANDRA disengages from the adults and rushes to the 
     sobbing NATHAN and clutches him to her breast, soothing him...and
     MACE joins her, hovering over his son.

     ANGLE ON TODD, watching.  After a moment, TODD scrambles off the
     roof and drops into the adjoining trench while "OH, HOLY NIGHT"
     continues to blend with the soughing WIND.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

     Lit by spill from a window in the wall of the trench, TODD starts 
     doing push-ups.  One-two-three-four-five-six-fast-fast-fast-fast.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR AND MEETING ROOM/SETTLEMENT - (ANOTHER) DAY

     HAWKINS is walking along the corridor outside the meeting room
     when she hears strange SOUNDS.  She approaches the door and looks
     in.

     ELLEN and other CHILDREN (including NATHAN) are playing
     children's games on the floor, paying no attention to the source
     of the strange noises...JOHNNY and WILL.

     JOHNNY and WILL are doing exercises, obviously inspired by TODD's 
     martial calisthenics, and including the sudden violent movements.

     As the two boys make their ritual grunting noises, HAWKlNS frowns
     a worried frown, and we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  TRENCH GARDEN - DAY

     The seedlings have grown to twelve-inch stalks.  SANDRA is
     pulling some from the ground as TODD imitates her.  She shows him
     the fat edible root.

                                   SANDRA
                    We'll eat these.

     Other PIONEERS are also harvesting, with occasional glances at
     TODD as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY

     Cleaning vegetables, SANDRA is separating the roots, shaking the
     dirt off, cutting away the excess.

     TODD is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away
     with the knife.

     NATHAN is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs.

                                   SANDRA
                    It seemed like he was never going to
                    walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's
                    an expert.

     Whump!  NATHAN falls on his ass.

                                   SANDRA
                         (a laugh)
                    Well, not quite an expert.

     TODD watches SANDRA go to NATHAN and hug him affectionately.

     Turning back to the vegetables, stone faced, TODD cuts his
     finger.  Blood flows.  He ignores it, continues working...

     But SANDRA, returning to the vegetables, notices TODD's cut
     finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand.

     TODD looks startled is she takes his finger.  Then, staunching
     the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious.

                                   SANDRA
                    Sergeant Todd...what's it
                    like...what's it like being a
                    soldier?

     What's it like...?  TODD stares at her, trying to process the
     question.  Seeing his difficulty SANDRA tries to help...

                                   SANDRA
                    What do you think about?

     No answer, a stare.

                                   SANDRA
                    Do you think about food?  Or women?
                    You must think about something.

     TODD gulps.  His blank stare could pass for stupidity.

                                   SANDRA
                    What about feelings then?  You must
                    have feelings.  You must feel
                    something.

     TODD wets his lips.  He seems about to answer...and yet it's
     difficult for him.  He could kill a person easier.

     On the floor NATHAN GOOS happily, oblivious.

                                   TODD
                         (at last)
                    Fear.

                                   SANDRA
                         (startled)
                    Fear!  You mean...you feel afraid?
                         (as he nods)
                    That's when you're in battle...
                    What about other times?  Now, for
                    example?

                                   TODD
                    Fear.

                                   SANDRA
                         (amazed)
                    Now?

                                   TODD
                    Always.

     A stunned silence.  Finally SANDRA speaks...

                                   SANDRA
                    You don't...look afraid.  You look
                    fearless.

     TODD looks at her.  This is incredibly difficult for him, like 
     physical labor.  He wets his lips and take a breath.

                                   TODD
                    Fear and...discipline.

                                   SANDRA
                         (growing horror)
                    Oh, my God.  But there's nothing to
                    be afraid of here.  I can't hurt
                    you.  I wouldn't.

                                   TODD
                    Always.  It makes us...alert.

     SANDRA is overwhelmed.  She reaches for him, hugs him to her
     breast like a little baby, holding him.

     But TODD is as tense in her arms as steel.  He can't relax.  He's
     even trembling.

     NATHAN, on the floor, looks up, smiles innocently.

     SANDRA lets go of TODD and steps back, looking at him, her face
     troubled, as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY

     ELLEN is supervising block building (babysitting) with several of
     the younger children (OMAR, BUCKY, ANGIE and JANICE) while WILL
     and TOMMY play their own separate games close by.  Then WILL
     looks up and sees something disturbing.

                                   WILL
                    You're not supposed to do that
                    anymore.

     He's speaking to JOHNNY who is doing martial exercises.

                                   JOHNNY
                    So what?  I'm a soldier.

                                   WILL
                    They're gonna kick him out.

     ELLEN looks up from the blocks.

                                   ELLEN
                    They can't kick him out...

                                   WILL
                    They're gonna.  My father --

                                   ELLEN
                         (interrupting strongly)
                   My mother says when someone's sick
                   or hurt, you have to help them.  You
                   don't have a choice.

                                   JOHNNY
                         (getting interested)
                   Yeah, but what if the hurt person
                   is...evil?

                                   ELLEN
                   You still have to help them...
                   because if you don't, you're evil!

                                   WILL
                         (importantly)
                   My father says...uh...he says,
                   "Soldiers deserve soldiers."

                                   TOM
                   Yeah.  That's what my father said
                   too.

                                   ELLEN
                   My father's making Sergeant Todd a
                   scarf because he saved his life one
                   time.  He's knitting it.
                                   WILL
                   That's dumb.  Your father's dumb.

     WILL is smirking with satisfaction at having settled that when
     out of nowhere ELLEN's little fist hits him hard on the nose.
     WILL looks stunned.  Blood oozes from his nose.  He starts to
     cry.

     ELLEN looks horrified at what she's done as we...

     INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY

     The scarf!  It's been knitted with an elaborate and colorful
     design.

                                   JIMMY PIG'S WIFE (O.S.)
                   Jimmy knitted it himself.  He worked
                   on it for two months.

     SANDRA is examining the knitted scarf as JIMMY PIG and his WIFE
     stand in the doorway.

                                   SANDRA
                   It's beautiful, Jimmy.  He'll love
                   it.

     JIMMY PIG looks very embarrassed.  He shrugs.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                   He saved my life out there.  I guess
                   Mace told you.

                                   SANDRA
                         (nods)
                   You should give it to him yourself.
                   I think he's in the meeting room...
                   doing...exercises.

     JIMMY PIG nods, takes the knitted scarf back from SANDRA as we...

     EXT.  ALLEY/CITY - NIGHT

     Frantic CIVILIANS, mostly women and children, are illuminated by 
     FLASHES from rocket fire overhead as they scramble for cover
     amidst heavy CROSSFIRE from automatic weapons.

     A terrified LITTLE GIRL, separated from her family, seeks shelter
     in a doorway when suddenly she's confronted by THREE SOLDIERS IN
     RED UNIFORMS looming over her.

     Looking up in abject horror, she sees a RED SOLDIER casually pan
     his assault rifle, pointing the muzzle right at her from only a
     foot away, unmistakably flexing to fire.

     BLAM!  Suddenly the RED SOLDIER is blown backwards violently,
     shot in the chest.

     ANGLE ON TODD, visored, in a torn black uniform, firing again.

     BLAM!  A SECOND RED SOLDIER goes down.

     CLICK!  TODD's weapon jams.

     As the LITTLE GIRL, amazed to be alive, watches open mouthed,
     TODD swings his weapon like a club, attacking the THIRD RED
     SOLDIER before he can aim.

     Then she runs, leaving TODD savagely beating the THIRD RED
     SOLDIER to death.

     TODD is delivering a final savage blow to the prone body when a 
     movement or shadow catches the corner of his eye and he whirls 
     savagely to defend himself from behind --

     INT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY

     WHUMP!  JIMMY PIG is slammed up against the wall of the meeting
     room, TODD's big hand around his neck.
     Gurgling desperately, his eyes popping out of his head, JIMMY PIG
     stares helplessly into TODD's merciless soldier eyes and his
     stone face only inches away.

     TODD blinks.  He sees he's got a terrified JIMMY PIG pinned to
     the wall, his feet dangling two feet off the floor.  Slowly he
     lowers JIMMY PIG to the floor.

     All JIMMY PIG can do is squeak desperately and point to the
     floor.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                   Scarf!  Scarf!

     TODD looks down.  He sees a knit scarf lying on the floor.  He
     doesn't understand.  He looks up.

     He sees JIMMY PIG'S WIFE, HAWKINS, SLADE, and several other
     PIONEERS standing in the doorway of the meeting room, their
     stunned expressions indicating they just saw something
     horrifying.

     TODD stands there, isolated, bare-chested, his huge muscles
     glistening with sweat, decorated with terrible scars and
     mysterious tattoos, as we...

     EVA, Johnny's mother, is reacting, horrified.

                   What....?  What... are...those?
                   Chester!  CHESTER!

     CHESTER, Johnny's father, rushes in to see what the commotion's
     about.

     ANGLE ON JOHNNY in the tin cauldron that serves as a bath tub.
     JOHNNY'S bare chest and shoulders are covered with crude
     imitations of TODD's tattoos.

                                   JOHNNY
                         (sullen)
                   Those are my war marks.  From the
                   battles I fought.

     CHESTER and EVA exchange a look.

     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MACE and SANDRA are lying awake in the bed in darkness.  For a
     long moment they're both silent with the silence that comes in a
     heavy moment in a conversation.  Then MACE speaks, his eyes on
     the ceiling.

                                   MACE
                   There's going to be a meeting.
                   People are upset about him.

                                   SANDRA
                   He's not fully recovered.

                                   MACE
                   That's what scares people.  He gets
                   stronger every day.

     They're both silent for a long moment.  MACE has something
     weighing on his mind that he hesitates to say...but finally he
     says it.

                                   MACE
                   I've caught him..sneaking looks at
                   you.  At your body.

                                   SANDRA
                   I know.

     A heavy silence, then...

                                   SANDRA
                   Are you afraid of him, Mace?

     MACE stares at the ceiling and speaks with difficult honesty.

                                   MACE
                   Yes.
                         (pauses, then)
                   God knows where he's been...or what
                   he's done.

     Another pause before...

                                   MACE
                   I've never been afraid of anyone
                   before...not this way.  I feel he
                   could break me in half...with no
                   real effort and no real...feeling.

                                   SANDRA
                   He told me he's afraid.

                                   MACE
                   Maybe he is.  It doesn't matter.

     MACE is staring grimly at the ceiling as we...

     INT.  WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Silent and surreal, the events of 1986 continue with the PASSIVE
     FOUR-YEAR-OLD sitting on the floor while the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-
     OLD looks down at him, and other FOUR-YEAR-OLDS gather ominously.

     It's only now, as he gets to his feet, suddenly trading vicious
     blows with the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD that we realize that this
     passive boy is FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD.  The boys don't fight like 
     children; they don't quit or cry as the blood flows.

     Highly-polished shoes, sharply creased trousers, and eyes
     glittering from the shadows are all that is visible of the
     faceless OBSERVERS who make no move to interrupt the violence.

     FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD, his nose pouring blood, exchanges savage
     hurtful blows with his opponent, bloodying him viciously, as
     we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

     Eyes!  The adult TODD blinks away the memory, stares straight
     ahead...

     into NATHAN'S face, only six inches from his own.

     They're all alone in the room.  It's very quiet.

     NATHAN smiles a tentative smile, raises a hand, reaches out to
     touch TODD'S face affectionately, curiously, testing their 
     friendship...
     ANGLE ON TODD, his eyes.  Dangerous.  He draws his face back
     enough to avoid being touched.

     NATHAN looks unsure.  He's used to affection.  Then he
     realizes... it must be a game!  He reaches out again...

     Again TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something
     catches his eye.

     TODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN.

     NATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game.

     TODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN.

     NATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift.  He's pleased.  It's that
     kind of game!  He gives TODD a friendly "thanks for the boot"
     smile.

     TODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now.

     NATHAN looks at the VIPER.  He doesn't understand what he's
     supposed to do.

     TODD makes a hitting motion with his hand.

     The VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling.

     NATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD.

     TODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes.  His look is intense, a 
     message in his eyes.

     The VIPER is like a spring, it strikes...

     TODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the
     snake and flips it a couple of feet.

     NATHAN stares.

     The angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again.

     NATHAN looks at TODD.

     TODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes.

     NATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea.

     The VIPER is about to strike again...

     SQUASH!  A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it.

     TODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down
     for NATHAN.  As MACE hugs the boy protectively to his chest, he
     glares down at TODD with eyes blazing with fury.

     TODD meets the look without blinking.  He never blinks.

                                   SANDRA (O.S.)
                   What happened?

     TODD turns to see SANDRA standing in the bedroom door, her eyes
     almost as hard as TODD's as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     TODD stares impassively as HAWKINS addresses him...

                                   HAWKINS
                   No one here has any animosity toward
                   you, Sergeant.  None of us here is
                   your enemy.

     TODD is standing in front of the room full of grim-faced
     PIONEERS, all looking at him.  It's like a court.

     HAWKINS is flanked by MACE and SANDRA...

                                   HAWKINS
                   Moreover, we respect your qualities.
                   We have no doubt that you are a
                   very, very good soldier.

     As she speaks, TODD's blank stare considers the weathered faces
     of the PIONEERS facing him.  He sees CHESTER, EVA, RED with his
     WIFE, JIMMY PIG and his WIFE, SLADE and MRS. SLADE, JUDITH, EMMA,
     SALLY.  As HAWKINS continues, TODD's sharp eyes pick out details.
     He sees JIMMY PIG opening and closing his hands nervously, he
     sees SLADE fingering a barely noticeable rifle barrel.  CHESTER
     has a weapon too.

                                   HAWKINS (O.S.)
                   But, because of your training, I
                   don't think you'll ever be able to
                   function in a group like this, a
                   community of vulnerable people, of
                   families, of children, where the
                   ability to fight is not the sole
                   purpose of existence.

     The PIONEERS are nervous, ready for trouble, afraid TODD might
     take this badly and fly off the handle.

     As TODD's huge hand opens...and closes, their eyes are on it.  He 
     could pick up the table and hurl it at them, break men in half
     with his bare hands.  His face is like stone, his eyes like
     diamond chips as he glances toward SANDRA.

     TODD sees SANDRA is moved, trying to suppress her emotions,
     biting her lip, as HAWKINS goes on...

                                   HAWKINS
                   You're different from us, Sergeant.
                   We don't hate you for that, but we
                   have agreed that to try to include
                   you would pose an intolerable risk
                   to the community itself.

                                   MACE
                   We'll give you any tools you need,
                   warm clothing, a good knife, boots.

                                   SANDRA
                         (emotionally)
                   And if you're ever sick...or you get
                   hurt...

                                   MACE
                   You're a friend, Sergeant.  It's
                   just...

     MACE doesn't finish.  TODD's eyes glance again at the PIONEERS.
     They too seem moved, not so ready to shoot.

     TODD blinks.  Once.  And we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH - MORNING (WIND)

     TODD is wrapped in a heavy parka, his mouth wrapped with the
     scarf JIMMY PIG knit, his eyes covered with eye protectors as
     MACE hands him another sack in addition to the one already over
     his shoulder.

                                   MACE
                   If you need us...you can ask us for
                   help.

     TODD glances at the knot of PIONEERS gathered in the trench, all
     eyes on him.  SANDRA is among then with NATHAN in her arms.  For
     just a second TODD's eyes go to the cheerful face of NATHAN; then
     he turns to MACE.

     MACE is startled to see TODD pull the scarf from his mouth to
     speak.  He's never spoken before unless spoken to.

                                   TODD
                   It's not true.
                         (then, with great effort)
                   I'm not a good soldier.

     Then TODD replaces the scarf over his mouth and starts to climb
     out of the trench into the wind as we...

     EXT.  LANDSCAPE (AND "STEEL HENGE") - DAY - LATER

     Four suns glare down from the sky onto the vast, windswept
     wasteland.

     TODD is a tiny dot in the vastness, traveling like a bug along
     one of the long cables that stretches for miles and miles.  He's
     out by the skeleton of the old ship as we...

     EXT.  ANOTHER PLANET - DAY

     A low slung armored vehicle on caterpillar treads RUMBLES over a
     steep rocky terrain faintly backlit by a cold sun that looms 
     enormously on the horizon while giving off only a faint glow.

     Hanging on to the outside of the insect-like scouting vehicle
     (called a "CRAWLER") are two nasty-looking NEW SOLDIERS in space
     suits designed for battle, their heavy rocket rifles cradled and
     ready, their visors blank and ominous.

     INT.  CRAWLER

     The husky sergeant, CAINE 607, steers the vehicle and speaks into
     a radio mike at the same time.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Crawler, Crawler to Daddy.  No
                   hostiles!

     The GUNNER beside him and the NEW SOLDIERS in the back seat stare
     stoically out the windows as CAINE 607 replaces the mike.

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

     RUBRICK is sitting at a console cluttered with coffee cups and
     half-finished cheeseburgers, responding to the radio.

                   All right, Crawler, Crawler, we got
                   you.  This is Daddy.  Continue per,
                   over.

     RUBRICK turns to CHURCH who's standing in the cramped cockpit,
     staring out a window at the gloomy planet outside, watching the 
     CRAWLER creep over the terrain.

                                   RUBRICK
                   We're clear.  We can send a crew
                   out.

                   Sloan's already on it.

     INT.  CREW QUARTERS/"DADDY" - DAY

     An oval hatch door swings open and SLOAN enters.

     VETERANS in coveralls, slumped or sprawled on steel-tiered bunks,
     scramble obediently to their feet, eyes on SLOAM.

                                   SLOAN
                   Suit up, fellas.  Time to go build
                   another play house.

     As VETERANS start to pull space suits from under the bunks, SLOAN
     turns her back on them...but hesitates before exiting as though
     expecting something.  Sure enough, veteran RILEY speaks up.

                                   RILEY
                   Sir.

                                   SLOAN
                   Yes, Riley, what is it?

     SLOAN says it even before she's turned.  She knew who it would
     be.
                                   RILEY
                   We haven't been issued weapons, sir.

                                   SLOAN
                         (as to a child)
                   You won't need weapons, Riley.
                   You're not soldiers anymore.

                                   RILEY
                         (saluting)
                   Yes, sir.

                                   SLOAN
                   You don't even have to salute
                   anymore.  A simple "Yes, sir" will
                   do.

     RILEY swallows hard and with effort keeps his hand from saluting
     as he speaks.

                                   RILEY
                   Y-yes...sir.

     SLOAN turns her back and exits.

     As the door closes, RILEY, unable to restrain himself any longer, 
     salutes hastily as we...

     INT./EXT.  COCKPIT - DAY - LATER

     Through the cockpit window in the bluish glare of a work-light,
     VETERANS, dressed in space suits, can be seem erecting a prefab
     hut on the harsh moonscape.

     SLOAN is watching them through the window while behind her
     RUBRICK lounges with his feet on the console and reads a current
     magazine on a VDT.  CHURCH is partially visible in the
     background, poring over charts in the navigator's cubicle.  It's
     very quiet until SLOAN speaks, almost to herself.

                                   SLOAN
                   Every time it's time to send them
                   out, Riley asks about weapons.  And
                   every time I tell him they don't
                   need weapons anymore, they're not
                   soldiers anymore.

                                   RUBRICK
                         (eyes on VDT)
                   Jesus!  It says here Macy's is going
                   out of business.  Can you imagine
                   that?  New York without Macy's?

     Silence.  SLOAN watches the VETERANS outside through the window.
     They're working like a team of ants in space suits, erecting the
     hut.

     CHURCH gets up noisily from the navigation cubicle and joins
     them, shaking his head.

                                   CHURCH
                   Next one's going to be a real pain
                   in the ass.

                                   RUBRICK
                         (reading, not interested)
                   Yeah?  What flavor pain in the ass?
                   Gravity pain in the ass?  Atmosphere
                   pain in the ass?

                                   CHURCH
                   How about a "gaseous currents" and
                   "urgent convections" pain in the ass.

                                   SLOAN
                   I think you're trying to say a "wind
                   pain in the ass."

                                   RUBRICK
                   Wind!

     INT.  PIPE - DAY

     WIND!  As the wind RAGES outside, TODD, wearing his parka,
     crouches over a tiny fire inside a huge open-ended pipe twelve
     feet in diameter.  He stares at the bleak, windy landscape
     outside his shelter.  He looks primitive, like a caveman, and
     very very alone as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  PIPE - DUSK

     The fat section of pipe is twenty feet long squatting in the
     blowing litter on the grim landscape in the shadow of the junk 
     mountains.  Somehow that inanimate pipe also looks lonely in the 
     vastness as the four suns overhead darken toward evening.

     INT.  PIPE - DAY

     The fire is nothing but coals.  TODD sits stoically over the
     embers, more alone than ever, chewing on a piece of dried food,
     part of his spartan meal.

     As he chews, he stares blankly at nothing until...

     A single tear crawls down one cheek.

     Then another.

     TODD looks like a stone statue oozing tears.  He reaches up and 
     touches the strange water with his finger, then studies the
     finger, as though a tear were the most remarkable thing he's ever 
     seen.  He cannot remember anything like this; he cannot remember
     ever having cried.

     And suddenly, without warning, he's convulsed with tears, heaving
     with sobs, alone in the big pipe with the pitiful little fire,
     bawling like a baby as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

     A VIPER writhes across the floor through the patterns of light 
     streaming through the window, a sinister presence, full of menace
     and evil designs.

     The VIPER winds its way toward an object that will prove in a
     moment to be a corner of the bad.

     SMACK!  The VIPER doesn't make it!  SMACK!  Another blow from
     MACE's heavy boot being swung by hand.

     The VIPER coils and HISSES angrily, wounded and dangerous.

     SMACK!  The boot again!

     NATHAN wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the HISSING VIPER!

     SMACK!  NATHAN hits again and...

     MACE rolls over in the bed.

     SMACK!  MACE comes awake, looks around.

     MACE lunges from the bed.

     SMACK!  Just as NATHAN gives the damaged VIPER another blow, MACE 
     snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away.

     SANDRA sits up in bad, looking around, alarmed.

     MACE is holding NATHAN, staring down at the VIPER.

     The VIPER has up the ghost, lying on the floor.

     MACE hugs NATHAN to him and looks toward SANDRA.  They both look
     at the boot.  And at the dead VIPER.

     Their eyes meet and, for a long moment, they just look at each
     other.

     MACE is wearing his parka, pulling on his eye protectors
     hurriedly as he opens the door to the corridor.  SANDRA's voice
     makes him stop and turn to her.

                                   SANDRA
                   Mace!  What about the vote?
                   Everybody voted.

     Mace glares at her for a moment, knowing she's right.  Then he
     turns away and starts out defiantly.

                                   MACE
                   We voted wrong!

     SANDRA looks relieved and worried at the same time and we...

     The military ship called "DADDY" (Defend And Attack Deployment
     Entity) is a big ugly insect gliding through a black silent void.
     On the grimy bulwark of the ship are the letters NAF followed by 
     serial numbers and the logo of the North American Forces.

     CLOSE ON space charts.  CHURCH's finger is indicating a tiny dot
     on the chart surrounded by a vast sea of space.

                                   CHURCH
                   It's a dump.  Literally.

     SLOAN and RUBRICK are looking over CHURCH's shoulder while a NEW 
     SOLDIER sits stonefaced at the control console flying the ship.

                                   SLOAN
                   No shit!  We're gonna set up a
                   monitor on a garbage dump!  So we
                   can monitor garbage rusting?

                                   RUBRICK
                   Will the wind affect the patrol?

                                   CHURCH
                   The Crawlers are low enough and
                   heavy enough, they won't blow.  The
                   men should wear armored vests and
                   carry double weapons and ammo for
                   the weight.  They may have to use
                   lines too, like mountain climbers.

     RUBRICK shakes his head, snorts disgustedly.

     EXT.  OUTER SPACE/"DADDY" - "DAY"

     As the grimy skin of the ugly military ship looms across our
     vision, a tiny orb is visible off the bow in the distance, a
     remote world, destination of "DADDY" as we...

     EXT.  CABLE/LANDSCAPE - DAY

     Alone, MACE is pulling himself along the cable as the wind
     buffets him.

     Ahead the cable stretches past the skeleton of the ship and the 
     "catcher trenches" toward the mountains of junk towering over the
     flat landscape several miles off.

     A heavy barrel blows by, then an old refrigerator tumbles past.

     MACE squints into the wind.

     Off to the right about a quarter mile away he can see a big piece
     of pipe...and a trail of smoke blowing out of the pipe and 
     disappearing in the wind.

     MACE struggles the cable past flooded "catcher trenches" as
     we...

     EXT.  PIPE/LANDSCAPE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

     The pipe lies fifty yards off the cable to the right.  As MACE
     pulls even with it, he can see right inside.

     TODD is standing just inside the mouth of the pipe, looking
     straight out at MACE...but the light is behind him and MACE can't
     see TODD's face as he SHOUTS at him.

                                   MACE
                   TODD!  TODD!
                         (pauses, then)
                   TODD!  WE WANT YOU TO COME BACK!  WE
                   MADE A MISTAKE!

     MACE starts toward him, letting go of the wire, struggling in the 
     wind.

     TODD watches him come.

     MACE stumbles on, dances a few feet, recovers, struggles toward
     TODD, SHOUTING....

                                   MACE
                   TODD!  WE'RE SORRY!  WE WERE WRONG!

     Just then, a sharp gust staggers MACE, driving him several yards 
     toward a "catcher trench."

     He's teetering on the lip of the flooded trench, about to fall
     in, when TODD'S strong arms grab him.

     They look like a strange four-footed beast as TODD drags him
     through the wind in an awkward "embrace" toward the cable.

     Once MACE has the cable in his hands, he laughs and gasps...

                                   MACE
                   Damn!  Thank you, Todd.  God damn!
                   I almost took a... a...swim there!

     MACE breaks off.  Todd isn't listening; he's looking off toward
     the horizon.

     MACE follows his look.

     Five miles away he can see an ugly insect-shaped spacecraft
     descending from about ten thousand feet.

                                   MACE
                   My...God!  Someone's landing.

     TODD doesn't answer.  He's staring at the descending ship with
     soldier eyes and a stone face as we...

                                   SANDRA
                   What's going on?

                   spotted a ship!

     SANDRA stands there stunned as excited PIONEERS mill past her,
     jamming the corridor, and we...

     EXT.  CABLE - DAY

     TODD is on the cable with MACE, his eyes on the squat beetle-like 
     object crawling slowly toward then through the junk half a mile
     away.

                                   MACE
                   Look at that.  It's some kind of
                   vehicle.  A landing party.  HEY!

     MACE raises his arm to wave.

     Without taking his eyes off the approaching CRAWLER, TODD grabs
     MACE's arm and pulls it down.

     MACE looks at TODD, sees the grim expression on TODD's stone
     face, and suddenly MACE is worried too.

     INT.  CRAWLER

     Peering through binoculars, a soldier in the front passenger
     seat, the GUNNER, nudges the DRIVER and indicates something to
     the right.

     Two tiny FIGURES in the distance on a long cable.

     The driver is the beady-eyed giant, CAINE 607.  Reacting to what
     he see, he adjusts the vehicle to the right.

     EXT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE

     Two ominous NEW SOLDIERS wearing plexi-goggles and bulky armor
     under their uniforms hang on the outside of the CRAWLER in the
     wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big
     rocket rifles across their chests.  They're looking ahead toward
     the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly
     forward through the litter, an evil vision.

     EXT.  LANDSCAPE

     TODD and MACE are running, TODD in the lead, buffeted by wind, 
     struggling through a clutter of old machinery, diesel engines, 
     turbines, scattered haphazardly on the flat desert floor.

     MACE is running too, not as well, and TODD has to reach back and
     grab him, pull him along...

                                   MACE
                         (gasp)
                   ...maybe...they're...
                         (gasp)
                   ...friendly...

     INT.  CRAWLER

     The GUNNER works a servomotor, aiming a cannon, as he peers
     through a scope.

     Through the scope, surrounded by digital readouts, we see two
     tiny running FIGURES...

     EXT.  CRAWLER

     BALAAM!  BALAAM!  The CRAWLER cannon FIRES...

     EXT.  LANDSCAPE

     MACE screams, he's hurled wildly mid-stride, tossed ten yards.

     TODD looks back, sees him lying on the sand, screaming in pain.

     TODD turns back, sprinting, low, weaving, tossed by the wind.

     WHOOOM!  Another SHOT.  If the wind hadn't hit him, TODD would
     have been hit.

     MACE is screaming.  His right leg is gone.

     TODD gets him, drags him, stumbles.

     WHOOM!  Another SHOT, another miss.

     TODD struggles for cover, staggering in the wind with MACE on his 
     back.

     INT.  CRAWLER

     Through his scope, the GUNNER sees TODD and MACE dive behind a
     big turbine.

     Unhurriedly the GUNNER flicks a switch on the dash.

     CAINE 607 nods approval.

     The GUNNER works the servo, bringing the cannon to bear on the
     turbine.

     EXT.  TURBINES

     TODD is dragging MACE along behind the cover of the turbine,
     glancing back for what he knows will occur.

     BAWHOOM!  The area where they disappeared EXPLODES, chunks of 
     steel fly.

     TODD keeps pulling MACE, who looks half dead as...

     BAWHOOM!  The TURBINE is hit again!

     INT.  CRAWLER

     Through the scope, the GUNNER aims again and watches another
     chunk of turbine disintegrate.

     The GUNNER glances at the robot-faced driver.  Their eyes meet.
     CAINE 607 nods.  Obviously, they've killed the two men.

     The GUNNER points to the cable.

     CAINE 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the
     vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike.

     EXT.  ABANDONED ENGINES/TERRAIN

     TODD is crouched over MACE inside an abandoned diesel engine not
     far from the disintegrated turbine.  He's making a tourniquet to
     stop the bleeding from the stump of MACE's leg.  MACE looks
     awful, pale, in shock.  He speaks weakly.
                                   MACE
                   Oh, shit, Todd...I'm...dead...
                   aren't I?  I'm not going to make it.

     TODD meets his look but doesn't answer.  He finishes the
     tourniquet and turns his back on MACE to peer out through a gap
     in the engine at the CRAWLER.

     TODD sees the CRAWLER approach the cable, watches it veer left
     and start to travel along the cable...straight toward the colony!

     TODD turns and looks into MACE's face.  MACE's eyes are clouded
     with horror.

                                   MACE
                   Why?  Why?

     No answer.

                                   MACE
                   I'm not..a soldier.
                         (then...)
                   A...mistake?  Was it...a mistake?

     TODD shakes his head no.  MACE's eyes fill with new horror.

                                   MACE
                   Oh, my God.  They won't...they
                   won't...?  Not Sandra!  Not...
                   not...Nathan!

     TODD turns away from MACE and peers through the machinery.

     He can see the CRAWLER is a hundred yards away now, traveling
     along the cable toward the colony.

     He can see the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS hanging on the outside
     of the CRAWLER, hard faces, goggled and ominous.

     When TODD turns back to MACE, he finds MACE eyeing him with pure 
     hatred.  MACE sneers weakly.

                                   MACE
                   Soldiers!  Soldiers...
                         (gasp)
                   ...deserve...soldiers!

     His eyes roll back.  He's dead.

     TODD peers out again at the NEW SOLDIERS.  They look invincible
     as we..

                   People.  They've spotted people!

     Both CHURCH and SLOAN look up in astonishment from the card game
     they're playing on a tiny fold-out table.

                   "People"!  "People"?  What do you

                                   RUBRICK
                   Two civilians.  Unarmed.  They've
                   killed both of them.  They've
                   spotted smoke from some kind of camp
                   and they're going to check it out.

     EXT. GARDEN TRENCH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     HAWKINS, JIMMY PIG, RED, and other PIONEERS are peering over the
     lip of the trench just beneath the trellis.

     A half mile off they can see the CRAWLER creeping in their
     general direction.

     The garden is full of excited PIONEERS with their CHILDREN,
     everybody trying not to trample the plants, but trampling them
     anyway, as HAWKINS addresses them...

                                   HAWKINS
                   I'm going to go out and talk to
                   them.  More than likely they're
                   friendly.  If not...
                         (indicating Jimmy Pig,
                          others)
                   ...those of you with weapons will be
                   ready to defend us.  The rest of you
                   go back.

     HAWKINS turns abruptly and looks over the rim.

     The CRAWLER is closer now, only a quarter mile away, angling to
     the left along the wire.

     HAWKINS starts to climb out of the trench, boosted by JIMMY PIG
     and CHESTER.  She's waving her arms, shouting.

                                   HAWKINS
                   HERE!  OVER HERE!

     SANDRA looks worried.

     INT.  CRAWLER

     CAINE 607 and the GUNNER both see the tiny figure waving at them
     a quarter mile away, trying to get their attention.

     As CAINE 607 adjusts their course to the left, the GUNNER's
     servomotor WHINES as he aims, peering through the scope at the 
     helpless figure of HAWKINS.

     EXT.  SETTLEMENT/LANDSCAPE

     ANGLE ON HAWKINS suddenly reacting to the sight of the vicious-
     looking CRAWLER coming straight toward her, now only five hundred 
     yards away.  They don't look too friendly!  Frightened, she's
     lowering her arms and turning when...

     BLAAAAM!  The cannon flashes, HAWKINS flies backwards!

     EXT.  INSIDE GARDEN TRENCH

     HAWKINS' body flies back onto the PIONEERS in the trench.  Panic 
     erupts as...

     CHESTER raises his light rifle and starts FIRING over the lip of
     the trench.

     BAWHOOM!  The whole edge of the trench explodes, dirt flies, and
     CHESTER is hurled backwards, dead.

     PIONEERS are screaming and running wildly down the trenches...

     JIMMY PIG bravely aims his rifle over the lip of the trench.

     He sees the CRAWLER is lumbering right at him.

     PING!  PING!  His shots are pitiful.  The CRAWLER keeps coming.

     ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG.  No choice but to retreat.  He turns and
     hurries down the trench after the others as we...

     CHURCH and SLOAN look up from their card game again as RUBRICK
     sticks his head in the door to report the latest.

                   Report from Crawler One.  Everything
                   under control.  No need for

                   There's resistance?

                                   RUBRICK
                   Ineffectual.  About fifty
                   disorganized people with almost no
                   fire power.  Three men are going in
                   to clean them out; one man's staying
                   with the Crawler.

                                   CHURCH
                   Humph.  Sounds reckless, three
                   against fifty.  The old ones, the
                   veterans, they would have called for
                   support...just in case.

     Again RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a glance and an eye-roll at the 
     fretting old fuddy-duddy.  Then SLOAN changes the subject
     brightly.

                   Speaking of Riley and his old

     A PIONEER is backing away ten yards in front of him, firing
     wildly.  POW!  POW!  POW!

     The NEW SOLDIER looks at one of his armor-gloved hands, opening
     the palm in front of his face.  His hand's been hit.  He shakes
     it, annoyed, like it was a bee sting, then he aims at the
     PIONEER.

     WHOOOOSH!  A tongue of fire from the NEW SOLDIER's flame thrower

                   Keep going, children, don't panic,

     Two Pioneers, SALLY and RED, lunge from a doorway into the trench
     and fire a rifle and a pistol at a THIRD SOLDIER who's advancing 
     along the trench.

     BANG!  BANG!  PING!  SPLAT!

     SALLY and RED dive back in the doorway for cover where a pioneer
     named SINGH is crouched, watching with alarm the THIRD SOLDIER 
     advancing unfazed.

     ANGLE ON THE THIRD SOLDIER coming toward them.

     ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS huddled in the doorway.

                                   RED
                   They got armored vests.  You got to
                   aim for exposed parts like the

                                   SINGH
                   Here goes.

     RED and SALLY watch SINGH step out directly in front of the
     advancing THIRD SOLDIER and FIRE five shots rapidly...PING!
     PIZG!  PING!  PING!  PING!

     WHOOOOSH!  RED and SALLY see SINGH incinerated before their eyes.

     Exchanging a horrified glance, they turn to retreat down the
     interior corridor, but before they get two steps, they freeze...

     A SOLDIER is in the corridor, not looking at them, but breaking
     down a door.  They can't go that way!

     Trapped, they turn to see the THIRD SOLDIER almost to the
     doorway, his flame thrower aimed, his finger on the trigger,
     and...

     A blur!  Something lands on the THIRD SOLDIER from above the
     trench, and the THIRD SOLDIER falls over backwards, slamming hard
     to the floor of the trench.

     But he's a super soldier, so that almost at the same time he hits
     the ground he's already lunging upward to regain his feet and
     fight except...

     A knife blade rips across his throat, opening it wide in one
     swift movement, and...

     The THIRD SOLDIER's head sags back because not even superman can
     fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi 
     goggles is...

     TODD looming over him with a bloody knife, a face like stone, and
     fierce soldier's eyes.

     ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY, where RED, SALLY, and another PIONEER peer 
     around the corner, eyes wide with amazement at the sight of TODD 
     kneeling over his victim.

     ANGLE ON TODD, slipping the utility belt off the dead THIRD
     SOLDIER, yanking grenades and ammo from the bulky body, stuffing
     a heavy pistol in his own waistband.

     RED approaches timidly.

                                   RED
                   You want help, partner?

     TODD glances up at him, and RED sees TODD'S eyes and RED backs
     away quickly because...

     TODD looks badder even than the new soldiers!

     Turning back to the dead man, TODD goes for the last item...the
     goggles.  Ripping them off he reveals...

     A one-eyed soldier.  The dead man staring up at him is MELTON.

     For just a moment TODD stares into the dead face, revealing
     nothing of how he feels, as we...

     CHILDREN haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of
     obstacles they've placed in front of the door already.  The
     stove, everything is wedged against the door to the corridor.

     As they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other 
     belongings, the door quivers, the heap of furniture shifts.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     The FIRST SOLDIER, as big as an offensive tackle, shoulders the
     door again, and it gives...

     INT.  ROOM

     CHILDREN SCREAM as the mountain of furniture heaves backwards,
     and the door opens part way, revealing the FIRST SOLDIER.

     SANDRA grabs NATHAN and hands him to one of the children.

                   Into the bedroom, all of you.

     SANDRA picks up a stool to defend herself.

     INT.  BEDROOM

     Dashing into the bedroom, the children are greeted with a
     terrifying sight!  SMASH!  Soldier boots are kicking out the
     little window high in the wall, SMASH, SMASH, SMASH, and the
     window collapses, a boot sticks through the opening...

     INT.  OTHER ROOM

     Unhurriedly, the giant FIRST SOLDIER bulls through the furniture,
     tossing the bed and table aside like sticks.

     SANDRA smashes at him with the stool, hitting him twice, hurling
     it in his face.

     The FIRST SOLDIER shakes off the blow as if he'd been hit by a 
     feather.  But she's got his attention.  He turns his goggles at
     her, starts to raise his weapon as...

     SANDRA turns and disappears into the bedroom...

     INT.  BEDROOM

     As SANDRA dashes into the bedroom in blind retreat she runs smack
     into the chest of another soldier!

     Helpless and horrified, she looks right into a cruel stone face
     and goggled eyes, and she gasps...

                                   SANDRA
                   Sergeant Todd!

     TODD never takes his eyes off the door as he brushes her roughly
     aside with one hand, while his other arm aims the heavy rocket
     gun right at the door and...

     The FIRST SOLDIER comes into the doorway with his flame thrower
     raised to torch women and children and what he sees is TODD
     looking right at him, aiming the rocket gun, and BAWHOOM, the
     FIRST SOLDIER is blown clear back across the other room with a 
     shot right in the chest.

     ANGLE ON SANDRA, still on the floor where he knocked her,
     watching TODD exit the room, weapon raised, his utility belt
     dangling bandolier style across his chest.

     He looks like...one of them!  A soldier!

     INT.  OTHER ROOM

     Crossing the next room, TODD moves quickly to the door, flattens,
     and peers into the corridor.

     He sees the SECOND SOLDIER heading toward him.

     BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires twice around the door and sees...

     The SECOND SOLDIER staggering back, hit, a pistol from his
     hip...

     Dirt explodes around the door frame as TODD ducks back.  Quick as
     a wink, he yanks a grenade from his utility belt, triggers it,
     and flips it around the corner as CRACK!  a shot rips at his arm.

     BAWHOOM, the grenade goes off and, bleeding from his arm, TODD
     swings into the corridor and follows the grenade with three quick 
     rocket shots.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Keeping low, TODD charges, his weapon pointed at the fallen
     SECOND SOLDIER.

     The SECOND SOLDIER is sprawled bloodily in the corridor, the
     walkie-talkie on his chest squawking urgently.
                                   WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
                   Crawler One calling Double Mike.
                   Give me an "okay," Double Mike.

     TODD seizes the walkie-talkie, presses the transmit button, and
     snarls a throaty animal growl into the mike...

     CAINE 607 is sitting at the wheel of the motionless vehicle
     parked near the trench garden, radio mike in hand, when he hears
     the low ANIMAL SNARL come across his speaker.

     CAINE 607's robot face reveals nothing as he listens to ANOTHER
     GROWL.  WIND HOWLS outside.

     Then he flicks a switch on the dash and puts the mike to his

     while the wind, inaudible inside the ship, rages around them, 
     staggering them this way and that.  What we hear in the quiet

                   Well, he didn't say the word
                   "growl."  He said a "throat-noise,"
                   but I asked him to imitate it and it
                   sounded like a growl to me.

                                   CHURCH
                   My God!  Who are we fighting here!

                   I think...I think we have to assume
                   the missing men are...down.

                   No reinforcements, then they walk
                   right into an enemy stronghold.

                                   RUBRICK
                   We could send reinforcements now...

                         (sharply)
                   Absolutely not.  Those bastards are
                   just waiting in there for us.  No
                   more of this fancy super-soldier
                   shit.  We do it with the hammer...

     RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a nervous glance as CHURCH paces
     agitatedly.

                                   RUBRICK
                   Uh, what does that mean, "the
                   hammer"?

     EXT.  LANDSCAPE - DUSK

     The four suns are dimming noticeably, dusk is falling.

     The wind HOWLS, junk drifts and shifts.

     A corpse turns over in the wind.  It's HAWKINS' BODY, ravaged by
     the turbulent air, as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  EARTHEN CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     Someone is dragging a CORPSE down the smoky, lamplit corridor as 
     little NATHAN watches SANDRA tending to the bloody wounds of a
     PIONEER lying on the floor.  As the CORPSE is dragged past
     NATHAN, the lifeless, vacant eyes stare right at the
     uncomprehending little boy.

     NATHAN sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, ANGIE, sobbing
     uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds.  SANDRA is
     trying to help with the bandages and console ANGIE at the same
     time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people GROAN
     and children CRY OUT.

     NATHAN doesn't understand it, it's confusing.  MEN and WOMEN loom
     past him.  He wobbles off down the corridor, toddling away from
     the sounds of pain.

     SHUK!  KA-SHUK!  Strange SOUNDS come from a doorway ahead, the
     doorway to the meeting room.  CHAK!  KLAK!  SHIK CHIK KA CHIK!
     The sound of metal and metal, metal parts CLICKING and SLIDING.

     Alone in the corridor, NATHAN toddles innocently forward, toward
     the SOUNDS.

     INT.  MEETING ROOM

     NATHAN wobbles into the meeting room doorway and stops there,
     staring.

     The burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room,
     leaving a large open space where TODD, bare-chested, a tourniquet
     on one arm, is squatting on the floor, skillfully reassembling a
     stripped rifle.

     Surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles, 
     pistols, ammo clips, utility belts, goggles, torn armor vests,
     boots, grenades, knives, and flashlights he salvaged from the
     dead soldiers.  TODD looks up at NATHAN and their eyes meet.

     NATHAN recognizes his "friend," tries a tentative little smile.
     But TODD just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from 
     NATHAN's face.  For a long moment they just look each other in
     the eyes very seriously.

     SANDRA enters, her dress covered with the wounded man's blood.
     Not noticing TODD, she rushes to NATHAN, grabs him...

                                   SANDRA
                   Nathan, thank God, there you...

     Suddenly seeing TODD she breaks off, stares at him.

     Squatting on the floor, surrounded by weapons, TODD'S eyes meet
     hers for a long moment...then he looks away, goes back to
     assembling the weapons with quick sure movements, almost as if he 
     wanted to avoid her eyes.

     SANDRA wets her lips to speak, hesitates, then finally blurts out
     what she can hardly bear to ask...

                                   SANDRA
                   Did he find you?

     No answer.  TODD finishes with the weapon, starts checking the
     next one.

                                   SANDRA
                   My husband...Mace...he went out to
                   look for you.  He...found you,
                   didn't he?

     TODD looks up at her and nods.  Their eyes lock.

                                   SANDRA
                   They...killed him...didn't they?

     TODD nods, turns back to his arsenal.

     SANDRA stands there, hugging NATHAN to her chest, holding her
     tears in, her lids quivering, fighting to conquer her emotion.
     After a long, difficult moment, she wins the battle with herself.
     She looks numb, stunned, but she's not crying.

     TODD has begun to dress.  He straps a sheath knife to one ankle,
     pulls on boots.  Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso, 
     covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and
     the tourniquet on his arm.

     Staring at him with glazed eyes, SANDRA notices a blotch of blood
     form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet.  She speaks 
     numbly.

                                   SANDRA
                   Your wound...it's still bleeding.

     Stuffing his pockets with ammo and other items, TODD glances at
     her with eyes that glitter dangerously.
                                   TODD
                   I like to bleed, sir.

     SANDRA stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress, pulling
     on a heavy armored vest.

                                   SANDRA
                   It doesn't...hurt?

     TODD pulls on a second armored vast, one that already has a
     ragged hole in it from a rocket.

                                   TODD
                   Not enough, sir.

     SANDRA watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the
     corner and take a blackened stick from it, watches him smear
     charcoal under his eyes.

                                   SANDRA
                   How do you know they'll come back?

     TODD looks at her, a savage with blackened eyes.

                                   TODD
                   They're soldiers, sir.  Like me.

                                   SANDRA
                   What...what do they want?

                                   TODD
                   Nothing.

                                   SANDRA
                   Nothing?

                                   TODD
                   They are obeying orders, sir.  It's
                   their duty.

     For a moment SANDRA is silent, then...

                                   SANDRA
                   You know who they are, don't you?
                   Do you know how many there'll be?

     TODD crosses two utility belts across his armored chest like 
     bandoliers.

                                   TODD
                   Seventeen more, sir.

                                   SANDRA
                   Seventeen!  My God!
                         (suddenly energized)
                   You can't fight seventeen yourself!
                   You have to organize the rest of us,
                   show us what to do.  We don't have
                   your...your skills...but we're not
                   cowards.  We'll do what you tell us,
                   we'll --

                                   TODD
                         (interrupting, softly)
                   No.

     His voice is soft as silk but hard as steel.  She looks into his
     eyes.  Does she detect a hint of approval, of respect, in those
     flat expressionless snake eyes?

                                   SANDRA
                   Why not?

     TODD turns to go, laden with weapons, a flamethrower on his back,
     a rocket rifle on his shoulder, another in one hand.

                                   TODD
                   Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.

                                   SANDRA
                   But...one soldier against seventeen!

     He looks back at her, right into her eyes this time.

                                   TODD
                   I am going to kill them all, sir.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

     The NEW SOLDIERS are putting on their heavy gear in ominous
     silence, covering their muscular torsos with armored vests and
     utility belts while SLOAN watches from the hatchway.

                                   SLOAN
                   Double belts, double ammo, double
                   everything!  You've got to be heavy
                   there or you'll blow away,
                   fellas...and we wouldn't want that,
                   would we?

     They continue dressing obediently, their eyes the sullen eyes of 
     robots.  But CAINE 607 speaks up, at once respectful and
     dignified...

                                   CAINE 607
                   It's dark now, sir.

                                   SLOAN
                   You're afraid of the dark, Sergeant
                   Caine?

                                   CAINE 607
                   No, sir.  But the manual says --

                                   SLOAN
                   That's what nightscopes are for,
                   soldier.  For the dark.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Yes, sir.  But the sixth rule is
                   "never give the enemy an advantage
                   unnecessarily."  If they're
                   expecting us --

                                   SLOAN
                         (erupting)
                   Listen, Sergeant, this may come as
                   news to you, but you're not a real
                   hot thinker!  Your pitiful efforts
                   at tactics have cost us three men
                   already.  So turn it off, that
                   little pea brain of yours!
                         (turning to the others)
                   That goes for all the rest of you
                   mental giants too.  All you have to
                   do is go boom-boom.  Understand?
                   Boom-boom!  Kill kill!  Say it...
                   Kill...kill...kill...

     Draped in battle gear the seventeen NEW SOLDIERS obediently
     repeat the words after her, their eyes blank and sullen...  "Kill
     kill kill..."  They look like somber death machines as we...

     EXT.  "CONSTRUCTION" SITE - NIGHT

     In the harsh blue glare of work-lights RILEY and the crew of
     VETERANS, dressed in heavy parkas, are struggling in the wind to
     erect the second side of a small hut.

     RILEY sees something, reacts.

     He sees seventeen NEW SOLDIERS exiting the ship in the fringe of
     the work-lights, ominous death machines in their heavy gear and 
     goggles, partly lost in shadows like some vision from hell.

     RILEY stares at them, at the men who carry the weapons he used to
     carry, his face like stone, his eyes a mystery as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     SALLY and RED are guarding a door to the trench when a CLANKING
     noise in the corridor behind them makes them turn and look.
     Their jaws go slack with amazement.

     Clanking toward them is TODD, so armored and laden with fighting
     gear he looks almost like a medieval knight!  He says nothing as
     he looms closer to then, heading for the door.  The two of then
     shrink hastily out of his way.

     EXT.  INSIDE TRENCH

     Stepping into the trench, TODD hears the wind SCREAM overhead.
     He approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and
     begins to pull himself up into the wind.

     As he climbs, the SCREAMING wind changes pitch radically, and by
     the time he bellies over the lip of the trench, the wind is only
     a breeze.

     Getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying, replaced
     by a terrible stillness.

     As TODD looks off into the darkness, a voice calls to him from
     the trench behind biz.

                                   SANDRA (O.S.)
                   Sergeant!  Sergeant Todd!

     TODD turns back, looking down into the trench, and sees SANDRA
     looking up at him.

                                   SANDRA
                   Sergeant...these soldiers...the ones
                   you're going to fight...  Are these
                   the "better ones"...the ones who
                   replaced you?

     TODD looks at her for a long moment, his face a mask, before he
     nods almost imperceptibly.  Her eyes are full of tears.

                                   SANDRA
                   Sergeant Todd...I think they...I
                   think...someone made a serious...
                   mistake.

     TODD looks into her eyes.  It is impossible to tell if he knows
     that she cares about him and that she is blessing him.

     After a moment he turns away and lumbers off into the darkness,
     the CLANKING of his equipment the only sound in the spooky
     stillness.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT.  JUNK/TERRAIN - NIGHT

     Two CRAWLERS cut through the night fifty yards apart.  Four of
     the NEW SOLDIERS cling to the outside of one CRAWLER, five on the 
     other, two on each CRAWLER operating spotlights that pan the
     darkness to the sides while the headlights illuminate the
     skeleton of the crashed ship and shadowy chunks of machinery
     littered across the terrain ahead of them.

     It is very still.  No wind.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     A DRIVER is at the wheel, a GUNNER beside him, studying the night
     through an infrared scope.  Behind them, two more NEW SOLDIERS
     sit lost in shadows in the back seat, staring impassively out the 
     window at the spooky spotlights combing the eerie junkyard.

     EXT.  CRAWLER ONE

     The LEFT FRONT SOLDIER sits on the fender seat of CRAWLER ONE,
     peering along the beam of his spotlight, scrutinizing the
     sinister shapes in the darkness, when...

     BLAM!  He's shot in the face, slammed back into the windshield of 
     CRAWLER ONE.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     Vision blocked, the DRIVER is fighting for control of the vehicle
     as the GUNNER to his right screams into the radio mike...

                                   GUNNER
                   CRAWLER ONE, WE ARE RED!  RED!  WE
                   ARE RED!

     By veering sharply, the DRIVER is able to shake off the body that
     was blocking his vision, clearing his shattered windshield.

     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     Seven of the NEW SOLDIERS -- the three hanging on CRAWLER ONE and
     the four from CRAWLER TWO -- drop off into the stillness.  One
     checks the LEFT FRONT SOLDIER's body while the others, barely
     visible in the weak light, fan out, keeping low, taking cover in
     the random junk strewn all around them.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE, a corporal, crouched behind a huge
     piece of discarded agriculture machinery.  He yanks a flare from
     his waist band and fires it.

     The FLARE bursts overhead, exposing the ghostly terrain to a
     bright green light.

     ANGLE ON THE JUNK AND THE SKELETON SHIP: a ghostly graveyard.  No 
     wind.  Nothing moves.  No sign of TODD.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     Maneuvering across the junk-strewn landscape, the DRIVER peers
     through the cracked windshield at the green terrain, looking for
     TODD as the RADIO crackles...

                                   RADIO
                   Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Do you
                   have a sitrep?

     THE GUNNER and the DRIVER exchange a glance.  The GUNNER takes
     the mike and speaks into it.

                                   GUNNER
                   Crawler Two, we are one down,
                   responding to sniper activity.

     INT.  CRAWLER TWO

     CAINE 607 is at the wheel, speaking into his mike.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Crawler One, do you require
                   assistance?

                                   RADIO
                   That is negative.  We will eliminate
                   the sniper and rendezvous at target.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Roger, One.  We are proceeding to
                   target.

     CAINE 607 accelerates the CRAWLER.

     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     The flare fades and the near darkness returns.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE peering out into the stillness, then 
     signaling NEW SOLDIER TWO who's hiding nearby.

     As the two NEW SOLDIERS step out from their sheltered positions, 
     they're joined by NEW SOLDIER THREE.  Exchanging hand signals,
     the three of them advance, spreading out cautiously.

     NEW SOLDIER THREE has moved about thirty yards away when suddenly
     he "disappears."

     EXT.  INSIDE A "CATCM TRENCH"

     SPLASH!  SOLDIER THREE has tumbled into a flooded trench.

     He struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is.  He pulls
     a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both 
     directions.

     The flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in
     water and littered with rusting junk.

     NEW SOLDIER THREE splashes along the trench, looking for a way
     out.

     His light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the 
     trench, a perfect ladder.

     He's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his
     beam down the trench behind him.

     NEW SOLDIER THREE'S POV of the flooded trench.  Junk and water.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER THREE, turning back and approaching the
     ladder.  Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again.

     Again his light illuminates the spooky trench.  Again, nothing
     but water and junk.

     Relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when...

     TODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon.

     Before NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him.
     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     As he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE
     stiffens.  Was that a stifled CRY?  Or not?

     NEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn
     and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

     TODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his
     head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant.  TODD is hastily rummaging
     through the soldier's equipment, looking for something.

     He finds it.

     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     NEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly
     a flare bursts above them.

     The NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them
     in a brightly illuminated landscape.  Before they can take
     cover...

     BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA.  Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench.

     NEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing
     on the ground, SCREAMING.

     ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench, 
     accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS....

     ANGLE ON THE OTHER NEW SOLDIERS, prone, firing toward the trench.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

     Tracers whizzing over the top of the trench illuminate TODD as he 
     races down the trench, running for his life.

     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     Still firing, CRAWLER ONE grinds up to the lip of the trench.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS charging toward the trench behind the
     CRAWLER.

     CLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle
     pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid!
     The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and
     diminishes backward like a man pissing...

     INT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

     TODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench,
     sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench.

     Sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries
     to scale the steep wall of the trench.

     WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The surface of the water-filled trench bursts
     into flame.  A fiery river of flammable liquid.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS reacting to something!

     NEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls
     over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them.

     ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS firing as they move toward TODD.
     They've got him now!

     ANGLE ON TODD bellying toward a rusting turbine, disappearing
     from view.

     ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE, separated from TODD'S hideout by the 
     trench, pouring heavy FIRE on the spot where TODD disappeared.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS communicating by hand signals as they move
     to surround TODD.

     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

     As rockets and canon shells SLAM into the turbine, TODD hastily
     attends to a nasty wound in the flesh his thigh, bandaging it
     skillfully, quickly.
     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     While CRAWLER ONE keeps TODD pinned down, NEW SOLDIERS move to 
     outflank him.

     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

     As TODD completes dressing his thigh, the CRAWLER stops firing.

     Silence.

     TODD peers out, assessing the situation.

     TODD'S POV of the terrain.  Vague glimpses of NEW SOLDIERS
     slipping from cover to cover, never exposing themselves enough
     for a shot.

     ANGLE ON TODD.  He seems to know he's in a tight spot.  He's
     preparing to fight off an attack, laying out weapons, grenades,
     when...he freezes.  Listens.

     Behind the stillness he can hear the faint WHISTLE that precedes
     the wind.

     Hastily TODD yanks his belt off.

     EXT.  TERRAIN

     NEW SOLDIER FOUR sticks his head up from behind an old boiler and 
     signals NEW SOLDIER FIVE.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FIVE acknowledging from the mouth of an old 
     storage tank where he's positioned.

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER SIX bellying toward TODD'S position.

     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

     Using his belt and a carabiner as a safety line, TODD attaches
     himself to the heavy turbine...and gathers up his weapons.  He
     can HEAR the very low WHISTLING building ever so slightly.

     EXT.  TERRAIN

     The WIND SIGHS and a faint breeze stirs.  Then a tin can skitters
     by in a puff of wind as the NEW SOLDIERS take turns moving
     closer to TODD, flanking him from safe vantage points.

     NEW SOLDIER FOUR stands to wave the next man forward when...

     WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!  THE WIND ERUPTS, ROARS, BELLOWS...

     NEW SOLDIER FOUR is lifted into the air and carried away.

     NEW SOLDIER FIVE is trying to stay on his feet, as the wind SLAMS
     him into one piece of junk after another.

     INT./EXT.  CRAWLER

     As the wind HOWLS and shakes the CRAWLER, the DRIVER and the
     GUNNER stare with amazement as NEW SOLDIER FIVE slams into their 
     windshield, neck broken, and stares at them with lifeless eyes.
     They see NEW SOLDIERS SIX and SEVEN tumble and somersault past.

     As NEW SOLDIER SIX disappears, blown off into the night, NEW
     SOLDIER SEVEN manages to grab hold of the walking wire.

     Gripping the wire for his life, he turns just in time to be 
     decapitated by a piece of aluminum housing flying through the
     air.

     EXT.  TERRAIN

     NEW SOLDIER FOUR, badly battered, is down on his belly trying to
     stay "under the wind" when he sees something terrible!

     HIS POV of a massive lathe blowing right toward him along the
     ground, tumbling, crashing, slamming into things.  It looms over
     him, unavoidable, the end!

     ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FOUR reacting to the huge lathe about to
     crush him.

     EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

     Held by his safety belt and protected by the turbine, TODD peers
     out, and watches the wind destroy the footsoldiers.

     TODD'S POV OF NEW SOLDIER FIVE's lifeless body being blown along
     the ground like a leaf.

     ANGLE ON TODD, reacting.  He's seen something important.

     TODD'S POV of CRAWLER ONE moving again, rounding the far end of
     the trench and, no longer separated by the trench, turning
     toward TODD'S position.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     As the DRIVER steers, the GUNNER peers through his scope.

     GUNNER'S INFRARED POV of TODD darting behind an overturned vat.

                                   GUNNER
                   There!

     The DRIVER steers toward where TODD disappeared.

     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     Windborne junk CLATTERS against CRAWLER ONE'S armor plating,
     debris flies through the bright swaths of the headlights, as the
     vehicle grinds toward the overturned vat.

     ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE coming around the vat, headlights glaring.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     The GUNNER is peering intently through his scope.

     GUNNER'S POV through his scope: The infrared view with crosshairs
     is especially spooky because of the debris blowing eerily across
     the landscape as the gun whips back and forth, looking vainly for 
     TODD.  Suddenly the sight is yanked hard, sweeping violently
     over to pin a moving object...

     False alarm!  Just another piece of blowing junk.  No sign of
     TODD.

     EXT.  CRAWLER/JUNK TERRAIN

     The CRAWLER grinds slowly past a huge overturned boiler, its
     cannon panning right, then left, then right.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     Peering through the scope as he sweeps the terrain, the GUNNER
     suddenly stiffens and back-pans to find something...

                                   GUNNER
                   Tentative at One.

     The DRIVER angles right, aiming for one o'clock.

                                   GUNNER
                   That's negative, no target.

     The DRIVER swings the wheel back and they continue slowly through
     the darkness.

     In the back seat, two NEW SOLDIERS peer into the night with blank 
     faces.  One of them is watching a huge plastic sign cartwheel
     past in the wind when --

     -- he reacts!

     -- as TODD'S face appears is only inches from his, right against
     the plexi!

     BAM!  Before the NEW SOLDIER can do more than look startled, TODD 
     shoots out the window with a pistol and shoves a live grenade
     through the hole.

                                   NEW SOLDIER
                   RED!  RED!  RE --

     BAWHOOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES and...

     The DRIVER fights for control of the wheel.

     The GUNNER screams and screams and screams like a machine running
     at high speed while the two NEW SOLDIERS lie open-eyed with death
     in the back seat.

     EXT.  CRAWLER

     No sign of TODD.  Disappeared again.

     As the wind ROARS furiously, the damaged CRAWLER limps along.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     The dying GUNNER is making awful noises while the DRIVER, eyes
     glazed, his face streaming with blood, maneuvers the vehicle
     slowly and cautiously, looking for the enemy...

     But all he sees through the cracked windshield is a shadowy world
     of wind-tossed debris.

     EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

     Protected by a hunk of pipe, TODD crouches and watches the
     CRAWLER, his eyes glittering, his weapon ready.  It's clear now
     that the tables are turned and he is the hunter as we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT

     EXPLOSIONS!  SCREAMS!  BAWHOOM!  Another shell hits, beams
     splinter, dirt walls collapse.

     Eight-year old JOHNNY, alone and terrified, comes in to view
     around a corner.  He's been separated from the others.

                                   JOHNNY
                   DAD!  DAAAAAAD!

     No answer.

     JOHNNY doesn't know which way to go.  The world's falling apart!

     WHUMP!  The little warren of earthen corridors is shaken by
     another BLAST.

     Desperate, JOHNNY makes a left, away from the last blast and
     hurries down a collapsing corridor past doorways that reveal
     rooms with no ceilings where the wind HOWLS.  It's obvious the 
     shelling has been going on for a while.

                                   JOHNNY
                   DAAAAAAAD!

     Just then, JIMMY PIG pops out of a doorway in front of him and
     and rushes toward him.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                   GOTCHA!

     BA-WHOOM!  Another shell collapses the corridor behind JOHNNY as
     JIMMY PIG grabs him and hauls him toward the door he emerged
     from, the Dining Commons.

     INT.  DINING COMMONS

     EMMA is ushering CHILDREN through a trap door in the floor into
     the root cellar as JIMMY PIG ushers JOHNNY into the room.

                                   JOHNNY
                   Where's my father?  Where's my
                   father?

     JOHNNY looks around urgently.

     SANDRA is bandaging TOMMY'S arm while ELLEN, NATHAN, and WILL are
     huddling under a table in the most protected corner of the room.

     JIMMY PIG and JUDITH exchange a pained look as JIMMY PIG pushes
     JOHNNY toward SANDRA and the table.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                   Johnny, get over under that table
                   with Miss Sandra and Ellen and the
                   others.  Miss Judith, you better go
                   on down the root cellar with Emma
                   and help with the ones down there.

                                   JOHNNY
                   Where's my mother?

     BAH-DOOOM!  Another fierce CONCUSSION twenty yards away shakes
     dirt from the ceiling.  ELLEN beckons from under the table...

                                   ELLEN
                   Come on, Johnny.

     EXT.  SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     MUZZLE FLASH!  FFFWHOOOMP!  CRAWLER TWO fires another round.

     The vehicle is squatting not thirty yards from the trench garden,
     pouring round after round into the colony, lighting the night
     with bright-colored flowery blasts.

     Crouched in the wind not far from the vehicle, the two NEW
     SOLDIERS from the back seat have set up a mortar, and they too
     are firing away.

     INT.  CRAWLER TWO/STATlONARY

     The GUNNER is looking through his scope, methodically aiming and
     firing as CAINE 607 at the wheel watches impassively.

     KA-FOOMP!  Another shot, the vehicle rocks, and, five hundred
     yards away, fire and dirt fountain thirty feet into the air.

     BEEP!  BEEP!  A light on the dash blinks on.  CAINE 607 switches
     on a radarscope, spots a blip.

     The GUNNER takes his eyes off the scope, looks at the blip.

     CAINE 607 is already manipulating a spotlight, looking across the
     GUNNER out the right window.

     The spotlight stabs the darkness, finds a moving vehicle a half
     mile of moving toward them.  It's CRAWLER ONE with its lights
     out.

     As CAINE 607 flicks off the spotlight, the GUNNER turns back to
     the scope and resumes his deadly barrage.  CAINE 607 speaks into
     the radio mike.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Come

                   Copy, Two.  Port to your nine and
                   commence firing.

     FOOOMP!  The GUNNER fires again, rocking the vehicle.

     CAINE 607 looks at the SCOPE.

     The blip continues on directly on its course.

     CAINE 607 picks up the mike again.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Again;

                   Affirmative, Two.

     FOOOMP!  The GUNNER fires again as CAINE 607 looks at the screen.

     The blip on the screen keeps on straight, doesn't alter course!

                                   CAINE 607
                         (into the mike)

     And suddenly CAINE realizes!  Dropping the mike he snaps at his
     GUNNER urgently.

                                   CAINE 607
                   Gunner, hard to port, target hard to
                   port!

     As the startled GUNNER starts to obey both of them are bathed in
     sudden, blinding white light as CRAWLER ONE suddenly switches on
     all lights and...

     KA-BLAM!  KA-BLAM!  MUZZLES FLASHES from CRAWLER ONE.

     WHUMP!  WHUMP!  CRAWLER TWO shudders, taking two direct hits.

     The GUNNER SCREAMS in pain.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     TODD is at the wheel, speaking into the radio as wind whips at
     him through the shattered windshield.

                   Roger, Two.  Affirmative.

     BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires as he drives straight ahead toward
     CRAWLER TWO and the two NEW SOLDIERS pinned in his headlight.

     EXT.  CRAWLER TWO

     As shells slam into CRAWLER TWO, the two NEW SOLDIERS outside try
     to get clear of the explosions, staggering off into the wind.

     INT.  CRAWLER ONE

     TODD sets his sights on one of the NEW SOLDIERS, cutting him down
     with rocket fire, then he glances toward the SECOND NEW SOLDIER
     on the right.

     The SECOND NEW SOLDIER, ten yards ahead, stops, turns to fire.

     TODD yanks the wheel, swerving toward him.

     EXT.  CRAWLERS

     CRAWLER ONE plows into the NEW SOLDIER, crushing him under the
     wheels, and continuing to grind toward the crippled CRAWLER TWO.

     WHAM!  CRAWLER ONE rams CRAWLER TWO and drives it sideways,
     pushing it ten yards... twenty yards.... thirty yards...until
     suddenly it sprawls into the mouth of the trench garden,
     splintering the trellis and wedging itself at a sharply canted
     angle over the garden, and we...

     stateroom.

     BZZZZT.  BZZZZT!  A buzzer sounds and a light flashes.

     CHURCH opens his eyes, sees the light flashing.

     Siting up in the bunk, he grabs the receiver of a phone and puts
     it to his ear.  As he listens, his eyes widen with
     incredulity...then they get wider as he hears more.

                                   CHURCH
                   Whaaaaat?

     INT.  DINING COMMONS/SETTLEMENT

     RED charges into the commons, shouting excitedly.

                                   RED
                   THEY STOPPED SHOOTING!  THEY STOPPED
                   SHOOTING!

     He stops abruptly, seeing...

     a blazing fire, whipped by wind from a shel hole in the ceiling, 
     consuming tables in the far half of the commons...

     while JIMMY PIG, SLADE and SANDRA struggle with one end of a huge
     beam that's fallen at an angle on top of a trap door in the floor,
     the root cellar.

     ELLEN, with NATHAN in her arms, TOMMY, WILL, JOHNNY and OTHER
     CHILDREN hover behind her, staring at...

     a six inch opening between the floor and the trap door where
     EMMA, JUDITH and OTHER CHILDREN, unable to squeeze through the
     six inch gap, peer out with frightened eyes, trapped.

                                   RED
                         (dampened)
                   They stopped shooting!

                                   JIMMY PIG
                         (to Red)
                   Give us a hand, dammit!

     As RED joins the effort.  SLADE snaps at him sarcastically as he 
     strains against the heavy beam.

                                   SLADE
                   You think (grunt) that's good they
                   stopped?  It means (grunt) they're
                   comin' for us!  To (grunt) kill us!
                   That's good news, you think?

                                   SANDRA
                         (looking for hope)
                   Sergeant Todd (grunt, cough) said...

                                   SLADE
                   That he's gonna (grunt) stomp a whole
                   army?  Couldn't if he wanted.

     The smoke is getting thicker.  EMMA and JUDITH are coughing, 
     looking scared.

                                   SANDRA
                   He (grunt) knew them!  He said --

                                   SLADE
                   He's dead!  If he isn't (grunt)
                   dead, he joined 'em.  He don't
                   (grunt) care about us, he's a
                   soldier.  Besides, we threw him out,
                   remember?

     SANDRA pushes at the beam with all her strength, fighting back
     tears of despair.

                                   SANDRA
                   He's not dead!

     The massive beam won't budge!  Eyes wide with terror, EMMA and
     RUTH peer out of their trap.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

     CHURCH is in the cockpit now, hovering behind RUBRICK who's
     speaking urging into the radio mike.

                                   RUBRICK
                   This is Daddy, come in, Number Two.
                   Daddy calling Number Two...

                                   CHURCH
                   What about Number One?  Try
                   Number...

                                   RUBRICK
                   I tried One.  I can't get either
                   one of them.

     SLOAN is pacing, looks sick to her stomach with fear.

                                   SLOAN
                   There was...some kind of...
                   guerilla action...

                                   RUBRICK
                   Then we lost them...

     Now CHURCH is pacing back and forth, panicky, ranting...

                                   CHURCH
                   You should have waked me sooner!
                   This is bad, very bad.  I never
                   should have let that clown Mekum
                   test his wonder boy army on me.  "If
                   it ain't broke, don't fix it."
                   Shit!  We don't even know what we're
                   up against.  How many...?

                                   SLOAN
                   We couldn't get any figures on enemy
                   troop strength.

                                   RUBRICK
                   Not even estimates...

                                   CHURCH
                   We're sitting ducks here!  There
                   could be a couple of divisions!
                   More!  We don't even have the
                   weapons to arm the old soldiers.

                                   RUBRICK
                         (into the mike,
                          desperately)
                   Hello...  Hello, One. This is
                   Daddy...

     EXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH GARDEN

     The radio in CRAWLER TWO is still SQUAWKING urgently with
     RUBRICK'S VOICE as the crippled vehicle lies sprawled at a
     violent angle over the trench garden.

                                   RADIO (V.O.)
                   This is Daddy!  Come in, Crawler
                   Two, come in...

     Nearby, A VOICE is crying out in pain in the night.

     Limping, TODD keeps his weapon ready as he searches out the
     sound.

     ANGLE ON THE INJURED SOLDIER, the one TODD crushed under the
     treads of the CRAWLER.  He's screaming in pain.  Looks up.

     TODD looms over the INJURED SOLDIER, weapon pointed.  Their eyes
     meet.

     In agony, the SOLDIER looks into TODD'S eyes, nods ever
     so slightly.

     BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires point blank.

     Now the only sound is the ROARING of the WIND and the pathetic
     sound of RUBRICK continuing his desperate RADIO BABBLE.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH GARDEN

     As the RADIO CHATTERS, burning debris from the CRAWLER canted
     over the garden illuminates the garden...and a BODY sprawled
     there, fallen from the CRAWLER above.

     BAM!  KABAM!  ROCKET FIRE!

     EXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH

     TODD FIRES rockets into the damaged CRAWLER...until the RADIO
     CHATTER stops abruptly.  RADIO killed dead.

                                                       CUT TO:
     INT.  DINING COMMONS/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     The gap between the floor and the trap door has increased to ten
     inches, enough for EMMA and RUTH to squeeze an INFANT through to
     SANDRA'S reaching arms.

     Soaked with sweat, gasping and coughing in the thickening smoke, 
     JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED continue to strain at the beam...and it
     moves.  Another inch!

     The fire is raging.  The INFANT SQUALLS in SANDRA'S arms.  SLADE
     snaps at her as he pushes on the beam.

                                   SLADE
                   Get them kids (grunt) hid somewhere!
                   There's soldiers coming.

     ELLEN and the CHILDREN look alarmed as SANDRA gathers them and
     ushers them toward the exit, glancing back toward the trap door
     as she's leaving.

     EMMA and RUTH meet her look with frightened eyes.

     Noticing SANDRA'S hesitation, JIMMY PIG reassures her...

                                   JIMMY PIG
                   Don't worry.  Couple more inches and
                   they're out.

     SANDRA and the CHILDREN exit.

     And suddenly!!!  The beam slips back five inches, almost closing
     the opening.  EMMA and JUDITH SCREAM!

     JIMMY PIG, RED and SLADE look alarmed, defeated.

     EXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH GARDEN

     TODD walks away from the smoking bulk of the CRAWLER canted over
     the garden and drops into a traveling trench.

     EXT.  INSIDE A PASSAGE TRENCH

     Limping slightly, laden with weapons and still wearing his
     helmet, TODD starts along the trench in the direction of the 
     settlement.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH GARDEN

     In the shadows six feet below the overturned and smoldering
     CRAWLER TWO, the BODY stirs on the floor of the garden, barely
     visible in the flickering half light from the flames above.

     It's CAINE 607.  He groans and stirs again.  He's not dead!  In
     fact, he's rolling over, struggling to his knees.

     INT.  DINING COMMONS

     The frightened eyes of EMMA, RUTH and CHILDREN peer from the four
     inch crack.

     Whipped by wind from the hole in the ceiling, the fire is
     spreading, the smoke is thick.  JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED are
     gasping with effort and coughing.  SLADE gasps to RED.

                                   SLADE
                   You know where Thomas keeps those
                   two axes?  Go get the axes.

     RED takes off at a run.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                         (so Emma and Ruth can't
                          hear)
                   We can't (cough) chop 'em out.  We
                   don't have time.

                                   SLADE
                   Just as good (gasp) to die chopping
                   as fighting.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     RED rushes through a smoky corridor.  Wherever shells have
     punctured the roof, the WIND whips debris about.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE GARDEN TRENCH

     Sitting up now, using a flashlight, CAINE 607 is examining a
     terrible gash in his thigh that reveals tissue and tendon.  The
     right side of his face is also badly injured, flesh torn, swollen
     and distorted.

     He pulls the first aid kit from his utility belt, opens it,
     focuses the light on the contents.

     Selects a couple of pills.  Swallows them.  Considers.  Takes two 
     more.  Pulls out a hypodermic needle, injects his leg.  Takes
     another needle, stabs his bloody cheek.

     His eyes glitter as he feels the rush from the drug.  He looks 
     dangerous again in spite of his condition.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE PASSAGE TRENCH

     TODD reaches the settlement, enters a half collapsed doorway.

     INT.  SUPPLY ROOM

     RED is urgently rummaging through crowbars, coils of rope, sledge
     hammers.  At last he finds two axes, grabs them and exits.
     INT.  CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT

     TODD picks his way among collapsed walls, fallen timbers.

     He peers through doorways, sees CORPSES.

     Moves on.  Searching.

     EXT.  INSIDE THE PASSAGE TRENCH

     Dragging a freshly bandaged leg, CAINE 607 makes his way along
     the trench toward the settlement.  He's using the wall for
     support...but he seems to be getting stronger rather than weaker.
     His face is hideous.
     INT.  JUNCTION OF CORRIDORS

     Carrying two axes RED zips around a corner and freezes...

     RED'S POV of: A SOLDIER, seen from behind, moving down a smoky
     corridor, helmeted, heavily armed, dangerous looking,
     unidentifiable.

     ANGLE ON RED, terrified, waiting till the SOLDIER (TODD) has
     disappeared in the smoke.  Then RED hurries on down another
     damaged corridor, axes in hand.

     INT.  OTHER DAMAGED CORRIDOR

     RED scoots around another corner and... stops short...an armored
     torso a foot in front of his face.

     Looking up, RED looks right into the distorted face of CAINE 607.

     Before RED can react, CAINE 607'S hand shoots out and snatches
     one of the axes.

     Astonished, RED backs up a step, and raises the other axe to
     defend himself.

     RED'S POV OF CAINE 607 looming toward him, axe in hand.

     ANGLE ON RED, turning and running.

     ANGLE ON CAINE 607 limping along, dragging his leg as RED
     disappears around a corner.

     CAINE 607 rounds the corner in pursuit... and see only smoke,
     no sign of RED.

     INT.  DINING COMMONS

     EMMA and JUDITH peer out from under the heavy metal trap door as
     JIMMY PIG and SLADE desperately try to move the beam using a
     piece of metal as a lever.

                                   SLADE
                   This (grunt, cough) ain't gonna
                   work.  Where's them axes?  He musta
                   run into soldiers and got killed.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                   How do you know there's soldiers coming?

                                   SLADE
                   'Cause soldiers (gasp) finish what
                   they start -- unless you stop 'em.
                   And we're what (gasp) they started,
                   and we didn't stop 'em!
                         (shouts to Emma)
                   WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUTTA THERE
                   SOMEHOW!  I SWEAR IT!

     Just then RED bursts into the room with a single axe, shouting...
                                   RED
                   SOLDIERS!  SOLDIERS!
                                   SLADE
                         (grabbing the axe)
                   Only one axe?

                                   RED
                   They took the other one!

                                   SLADE
                         (chopping furiously)
                   Toldja.

                                   JIMMY PIG
                         (to Red)
                   How many?

                                   RED
                   I... I couldn't... I couldn't...
                   count 'em.  Four, I think.  Maybe
                   five.

                                   SLADE
                         (chopping)
                   More!  Trust me!

                                   JIMMY PIG
                         (grabbing the axe)
                   Turns.

     JIMMY PIG starts chopping furiously.

     SLADE picks up a rifle, hands it to RED.

                                   SLADE
                   Do what you can.

     As RED looks at the rifle, alarmed, SLADE "comforts" him.

                                   SLADE
                   They're gonna kill us anyhow.  No
                   point in surrendering.
                         (grabbing the axe)
                   Turn!

     JIMMY PIG gasps for air as SLADE takes over chopping again.

     RED exits, worried.

     INT.  THE MEETING ROOM

     Huddled in a makeshift shelter of overturned furniture, with
     NATHAN asleep on her lap, SANDRA is reciting to ELLEN, WILL,
     TOMMY, JOHNNY, ANGIE, eight year old RAMON.

                                   SANDRA
                   "-- sailed an a river of crystal
                   light into a sea of dew.  Where are
                   you going and what do you wish the
                   old moon asked the three.  'We've
                   come to fish for herring fish...'"

                                   TOMMY
                   What's a "moon?"

                                   JOHNNY
                   I know what a moon is!  It's...

                                   SANDRA
                         (suddenly, urgently)
                   SHHHHHHH!

     SANDRA is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the 
     door...and sounds.

     She puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering CHILD, hushes
     another.

     A timber falls outside the door and SANDRA sees a shadowy shape
     enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness.

     Frightened CHILDREN hold their breath, peer out fearfully.

     CRACK!  SMASH!  The huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way, 
     switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness.

     The light wipes the damaged room.

     Suddenly, SANDRA gasps.

                                   SANDRA
                   Oh, my God!  It's... it's you!

     TODD maneuvers the flashlight beam, sees the frightened CHILDREN.

                                   SANDRA
                   Are you...all right?

                                   TODD
                   We should go, sir.

                                   SANDRA
                   Go?

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Peering into the smoke, RED reacts.

     RED'S POV of CAINE 607, obscured by smoke, crossing the corridor 
     ahead, not seeing RED.

     ANGLE ON RED, summoning all his courage, raising his rifle,
     aiming.

     BANG!

     ANGLE ON CAINE 607 reacting, looking toward RED.

     ANGLE ON RED scared to death, firing again!  And again!

     ANGLE ON CAINE 607 wrenching a heavy door from its hinges and
     holding it in front of him, shielding himself from RED's
     continuous shooting, advancing.

     ANGLE ON RED, firing again and again...and backing up.

     ANGLE ON CAINE 607 holding the door/shield as he advances on RED.

     Backing, RED trips, goes down flat on his back.

     CAINE 607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him.

     RED shoves the door aside, aims his gun up at CAINE 607, as the
     huge soldier looms over him.

     Before RED can pull the trigger, CAINE 607 snatches the rifle
     barrel and yanks the weapon out of RED'S hands.

     RED rolls, scrambles to his feet.

     And CAINE 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle, 
     crushes his skull with three brutal blows.

     INT.  ROOM

     TODD'S impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness
     he feels at what's happening to him.  TOMMY is seated on his 
     shoulders, he's got NATHAN in one arm and JOHNNY is nervously
     looking up at him as he clutches at TODD'S huge free hand, and
     now a little girl, SARAH, clutches at his combat pants as SANDRA 
     instructs her.

                                   SANDRA
                   Sarah, you hang on to Sergeant Todd.
                   No matter what happens!

     Clutching TODD's combat pants fiercely, SARAH looks up timidly at
     the big stonefaced man as SANDRA turns to ELLEN.

                                   SANDRA
                   Ellen, go to the Commons.  Tell
                   Jimmy Pig and Mr. Slade that
                   Sergeant Todd says we have to leave
                   as soon as they get everybody out of
                   the root-cellar.  Can you do that?

                                   ELLEN
                         (scared)
                   Uh, yes, ma'am.

                                   SANDRA
                   It's all right.  The soldiers are
                   gone for now.  But be careful where
                   you walk.  And if it's too smoky,
                   just come back.

                                   SARAH
                         (on her way out)
                   Yes, ma'am.

                                   SANDRA
                         (calling after her)
                   Tell them to bring all the food and
                   clothing they can carry.
                         (turning to the
                          children)
                   Do you all understand that Sergeant
                   Todd here is going to help us, and
                   whatever he says to do you must do
                   immediately, as if he was your
                   father or your mother.

                                   SARAH
                         (tears)
                   He's not my father!

     ANGLE ON TODD'S stone face.  Unfamiliar territory.

                                   SANDRA
                   No... but he's our friend.  Our good
                   friend.  Do you understand?

     Frightened faces look to the awkward "killing machine."

     TODD looks like a statue decorated with CHILDREN.

     JOHNNY is sobbing as he hangs onto TODD's giant hand obediently.
                                   JOHNNY
                   I want my father and my mother!  Can
                   he find where my father is?  I want
                   him to find my father!

                                   SANDRA
                   No.  No, he can't do that, but --

     A SCREAM!  From the corridor!

     SANDRA freezes.  TODD is alert, tense...and covered with
     CHILDREN.

     SANDRA turns and runs for the door as TODD starts to put the
     CHILDREN down.  But he's awkward, slow, not his usual graceful
     self, trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables.

     INT.  CORRIDOR

     Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her, 
     weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers
     after her out of the shadows.  CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid 
     obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.

                                   SANDRA
                   Sergeant Todd!

     ELLEN dives into SANDRA's arms and SANDRA turns, only three steps
     ahead of CAINE 607, and rushes into the meeting room.

     INT.  MEETING ROOM

     TODD is just putting NATHAN gently on the floor when he sees
     CAINE 607 arrive in the doorway.  For halt a second their eyes
     meet, then --

     CAINE 607 advances on TODD.

     Still encumbered by CHILDREN clutching at him, TODD sees his
     weapons, but can't get to them.  Then it's too late!

     The terrified CHILDREN watch as the giant CAINE 607 clubs TODD 
     mercilessly with the rifle butt, then hurls him backwards like a
     rag doll.

     Horrified, SANDRA sees TODD slam into a wall, slump to the floor.

     Dismissing TODD, CAINE 607 turns, looms toward the CHILDREN.

                                   SANDRA
                   THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN!

     CAINE 607 ignores her, heads for ELLEN, dragging his bad leg.

     Spotting TODD'S weapons, SANDRA snatches a heavy rocket rifle,
     brings it up awkwardly, points it, FIRES!

     And the kick from the heavy gun sends SANDRA sprawling back, the
     weapon trembling from her hands.

     But the WHIZZING ROCKET, a near miss, gets CAINE 607's attention.
     He turns away from ELLEN, toward SANDRA.

     ANGLE ON TODD rising to his knees, blinking stupidly, trying to
     focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead.

     TODD'S POV, a vague, unfocused image of SANDRA, snatching a
     bayonet from TODD'S gear on the floor and lunging courageously at 
     CAINE 607.

     Vaguely, TODD sees CAINE 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and
     grab her.  As she beats at CAINE 607 bravely with her fists, the
     big man slams her into a wall brutally.  As she crumples, he hits
     her again.

     ANGLE ON TODD struggling to his feet, staggering as he shakes his
     head to clear it.

     His eyes go to SANDRA, slumped against the wall, bloody.

     Terrified CHILDREN look up at CAINE 607 as he towers over them. 
     Suddenly...

     SHTUNK!  A knife blade suddenly sticks in CAINE 607's neck.

     CAINE 607 only flinches... and, as he YANKS the knife from his
     neck by the handle, he turns to see who threw the blade...

     WHAM!  TODD slams into him, tackling him, driving his big
     shoulder deep into the new soldier's waist, slamming the big man
     hard into a wall.

     Air goes out of CAINE 607, the knife drops from his hand.

     But that's it for TODD's victory.  Six-five, two-sixty, CAINE 607
     is bigger and stronger than TODD.  His powerful arms rip TODD off
     him like he's taking off a Band-Aid.

     Terrified, wide-eyed CHILDREN watch TODD hurled back across the
     room.

     TODD scrambles to his feet, shakes his head clear.

     Here comes CAINE 607, dragging his bad leg.

     TODD attacks!  Combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a
     vicious kick!

     But 607 counters expertly, brushing aside the attack!

     TODD lunges again employing yet another skilled move.

     SMACK!  CAINE 607 outmaneuvers TODD again, punishing him
     brutally.

     WHACK!  WHAM!  SMASH!  CRUNCH!  This time TODD jolts the bigger
     man with a terrible combination of moves, smashing him in the
     Adam's apple, kicking him in the knee, driving an elbow into the
     jaw.

     This time it's CAINE 607 who has to back away to recover.  And
     now he seems to re-consider TODD, revealing for the first time a 
     genuine respect.

     As their eyes meet, CAINE 607 seems to be saying "All right then,
     you're serious, let's do it, fella."

     TODD lunges.

     SMASH!  CAINE 607 creams him.

     TODD twists, slams CAINE 607 back.

     BASH!  A fist to the face!

     UMMMMMPH!  A knee in a groin!

     SLAM!  A head against a wall!

     VIDEO SCREEN/COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

     His face tanned from his Caribbean vacation, his image blurred
     and distorted by transmission, MEKUM'S VIDEO IMAGE stares 
     incredulously from the snowy video monitor in the cockpit.

                                   MEKUM/VIDEO SCREEN
                   You can't be serious!  This is some
                   kind of a joke...in poor taste.

     As SLOAN and RUBRICK look on uneasily, an indignant CHURCH
     addresses the image on the screen.

                                   CHURCH
                   Not only are we apparently out
                   twenty of your fancy new soldiers,
                   your supermen, we're out both
                   crawlers and all the weapons...so we
                   can't arm the old soldiers, the ones
                   you "improved" on, to defend
                   ourselves...

                          the screen)
                   We've got to get out of here,
                   Colonel Mekum!

     CHURCH flashes a scowl at SLOAN as, on the screen, MEKUM erupts
     excitedly.

     Delighted with his own genius, MEKUM smiles triumphantly from the

     INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     WHUMP!  TODD's bloodied head is slammed on the floor.  His eyes
     are almost swollen shut as he looks up at CAINE 607 kneeling on
     top of him.  Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath
     coming in gasps, but it's CAINE 607 who's on top, beating the
     last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one
     more time...before he slumps unconscious.

     Horrified, NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with
     the last of his strength, "finishing him off."  NATHAN can't
     stand it.

     He toddles toward CAINE 607, who's still on all fours, and
     attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's
     bloody face.

     The frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHAN's ineffectual
     blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet.

     Once standing, he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees.  For
     a moment he's confused.  What's this?

     Then he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself.  When
     he looks down at NATHAN again, tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as 
     dead.  One blow and...

     But just then big hands close around CAINE 607's ankles, tackling
     him.  As the giant topples, TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls
     on top of the fallen man.

     As CAINE 607 looks up into TODD's fierce face, the fight goes out
     of his eyes.  He knows he's beaten, he knows TODD will never
     quit.  He's helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as
     TODD puts the pressure on, CAINE 607 whispers...

                                   CAINE 607
                   It hurts!

                                   TODD
                         (sympathetic)
                   I know.

     SNAP!  TODD breaks CAINE 607's neck and watches the life go out
     of him.

     In the sudden silence as TODD, panting, stares at his defeated
     enemy, he hears a VOICE...her VOICE...very weak...

                                   SANDRA
                   Sergeant...

     TODD turns and sees SANDRA slumped against the wall where Caine
     607 threw her.  There's a trickle of blood coming from a nostril,
     more blood in her hair.  Her eyes don't look right.

                                   SANDRA
                   Nathan!

     TODD sees NATHAN looking at his mother with fear in his eyes. 
     Struggling to his feet, TODD picks up NATHAN and puts the boy
     down close to his mother.

     SANDRA reaches out and takes NATHAN's hand.  She holds NATHAN's
     hand toward TODD.

     TODD looks confused.

     There are tears in SANDRA's eyes as she pushes NATHAN's little
     hand into TODD's huge left paw.

     TODD looks down at the joined hands, then he looks into SANDRA's 
     flooded eyes.

     Does TODD understand her gesture?  His face is impassive.  Maybe
     he doesn't.  Just then a hand touches his shoulder.

     TODD turns to see JOHNNY face him, trembling but valiant, to ask
     the question the others are fearful of asking.

                                   JOHNNY
                    S-sir...sir, are you our friend?
                         (indicating Sandra)
                    Sh-she said you were our friend.

     TODD sees all the CHILDREN looking at him, their eyes big with
     hope and fear as we...

     Blackened with soot, JIMMY PIG still has the axe in his hand as
     SLADE manages, with a supreme effort, to hold the door of the
     root cellar up enough to allow EMMA and JUDITH to push the FOUR
     CHILDREN out of the cellar and then to scramble after them.

     Exhausted, SLADE lets the door fall back, picks up his rifle and
     turns toward the exit.  And freezes.  Dumbfounded.

     Standing in the doorway is TODD, laden with CHILDREN, on his
     shoulders, in his arms, surrounding him, clutching at his

     CRUDE LETTERS scrawled on the metal skin of the bomb say "LOVE

     The heavy bomb is lugged along a long narrow corridor.

                                   SLOAN (O.S.)
                    Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon,

     We see that RILEY and three other VETERANS -- GREEN, CHESLEY, and 
     MOORE -- are struggling to maneuver the heavy bomb along the
     narrow corridor and down a ladder hatch as SLOAN follows on
     their heels and CHURCH and RUBRICK, fretting, follow her.

     ANGLE ON SLOAN, punching a code into the device as she addresses
     the four VETERANS.

     RILEY, his face impassive, opens a hatch, revealing the darkness
     outside where the wind SCREAMS.

     As RUBRICK and CHURCH watch, the four VETS stagger into the
     darkness with the bomb, RUBRICK has to shout to CHURCH to be
     heard over the wind outside.

     As SLOAN shuts the hatch, she checks her watch.

     EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY"

     Carrying the heavy bomb in a sling, RILEY, CHESLEY, MOORE, and
     GREEN stagger past the work-lights into the darkness while the
     wind rages around them.  Holding the sling one-handed, GREEN is 
     illuminating the ground ahead with a flashlight.

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

     Flick!  Flick!  Flick!  Flick!  SLOAN is flicking switches as
     RUBRICK reads off a check list and she responds to each item on
     the list with "Roger."

     CHURCH is punching buttons on the control console, causing lights
     to light up reading "Port Power Cluster," "Starboard Power
     Cluster," "Vertical Stabilizer Unit," and so on.

     EXT.  TERRAIN

     Darkness!  Buffeted by the wind, RILEY and his COMPANIONS lower
     the bomb to the ground and release it gently.  They're just
     turning to go back, fighting the wind, when RILEY senses
     something.  He takes the light from GREEN and points it.

     The four VETERANS axe astonished at what they see.

     CRAWLER ONE, battered and motionless, is abandoned only ten yards 
     away.

     The flashlight beam probes the blown out windshield, the scarred 
     chassis, pans across the back seat...and pans back urgently,
     glimpsing tiny EYES.

     The EYES disappear behind the back seat.

     RILEY, CHESLEY, GREEN and MOORE exchange glances.

     The light probes again, this time revealing the frightened faces
     of CHILDREN cowering in the back seat, hiding from the wind.

     Suddenly RILEY whirls.

     Out of the darkness beside him, TODD looms.

     RILEY looks into the face of a man he saw killed!

     TODD has a CHILD in each arm and another hanging on to his leg
     for dear life.  He's wearing the scarf Jimmy Pig gave him.

     In the shadows behind TODD, JIMMY PIG, SLADE, EMMA, JUDITH and
     more CHILDREN are watching anxiously.

     RILEY's stone face comes as close to expression as it ever
     will...astonishment!

     The other VETERANS stare too, amazed.

     Suddenly RILEY gives TODD a smart military salute.

     ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG and SLADE exchanging a look of wonder.  What's 
     going on here?  They haven't a clue!  And we...

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

     The countdown clock is TICKING away, showing ten minutes, as
     CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN complete their pre-launch prep.
                                   CHURCH
                    Right horizontal?

                                   RUBRICK
                    Roger.  Right horizontal checks
                    green.

     CHURCH relaxes, looks up at the clock, satisfied.

                                   CHURCH
                    All right we're "go."  I'm allowing
                    us three minutes to clear the
                    atmosphere and get out of range.
                    That means we can wait seven more
                    minutes.

                                   SLOAN
                    Fuck 'em!  Let's just go!

                                   RUBRICK
                    She's right!  Four more casualties
                    aren't gonna mean anything to
                    anybody, especially when they're
                    already obsolete.

     CHURCH considers for a moment, then shrugs.

                                   CHURCH
                    I guess they wouldn't want to get
                    old anyway.
                         (to Sloan)
                    Go ahead, lock the hatch.
                         (to Rubrick)
                    Rube, punch up the port power
                    cluster and --

                                   SLOAN
                         (interrupting urgently)
                    What was that?

                                   CHURCH
                    Huh?  What was what?

                                   SLOAN
                    Sssshhhh!  Listen!

     SLOAN is listening intensely.

     All they hear is the HUM of the air system and miscellaneous
     WHITE NOISE.

     CHURCH and RUBRICK exchange a glance and are about to speak when
     they all hear it...

     A sound like a CHILD CRYING somewhere in the ship!

     All three of them stare at each other in utter amazement.
                                   RUBRICK
                    It sounds...

                                   SLOAN
                    Like a kid!

     Just then they hear it again, closer.

     CHURCH frowns.  What the fuck?

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  BUNKS/"DADDY" - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

     EMMA, JUDITH, SLADE and JIMMY PIG are settling most of the
     CHILDREN in the cramped crew quarters, pulling off hats and
     coats, when a COMMOTION causes them to look toward the open door
     to the corridor in time to see...

     a glimpse of RUBRICK being shoved roughly along the corridor by
     MOORE, his loud protests clearly audible.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Are you crazy?  You can't do this,
                    soldier!  You're going to be in
                    trouble.

     Then, as RUBRICK is pushed out of view, CHURCH appears, indignant
     and panicky, as CHESLEY hustles him past.

                                   CHURCH
                    I'm your superior officer, don't you
                    understand that?

     ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, exchanging glances.

     INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY"

     As CHESLEY shoves him along, CHURCH continues to protest...

                                   CHURCH
                    Don't you realize you're violating
                    the chain of command?  I'm giving
                    you a direct order to...to...to...

     CHURCH breaks off, suddenly speechless at the sight ahead of him.

     Here comes TODD, laden with more CHILDREN, the tattoo on his
     cheek clearly visible.  His eyes meet CHURCH'S.

                                   CHURCH
                    S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd?
                    It...  You...!  How...?  How...?

     Weak at the knees, CHURCH is still stammering as CHESLEY shoves
     him ahead.

     And then SLOAN, in the grip of GREEN, is hustled by.  She looks
     wide-eyed at TODD and the CHILDREN.

                                   SLOAN
                    Sergeant Todd!

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER

     RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN are still protesting as the VETERANS
     hustle them down the ladder toward the main hatch.

                                   RUBRICK
                    Listen, you don't understand!  That
                    bomb is triggered!  It's on a timer!

                                   CHURCH
                    We have to get out of here!  All of
                    us!  You need us!  You need us to
                    operate the ship...

                                   SLOAN
                    YOU'RE FUCKING MORONS!  CAN'T YOU
                    DIMWITS GRASP THAT YOU'RE KILLING US
                    ALL!  YOU'RE KILLING YOURSELVES!
                    THERE'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES LEFT!

                                   RUBRICK
                    NO!  NO!  NO!

     RUBRICK is shoved out the door into the night!

     EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY" - NIGHT

     RUBRICK desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage
     wind tears at him...but he can't hold on.

     As SLOAN and CHURCH are shoved out the hatch, they see RUBRICK
     blown off into the night, screaming.

                                   CHURCH
                    DOWN!  LIE DOWN!  FLAT!

     And CHURCH dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him.

     SLOAN does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them, 
     shutting them out of the ship..

                                   SLOAN
                    NO!  NO!  NO!  PLEASE!  NO!

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

     The countdown clock shows four minutes and twenty seconds as it
     CLICKS off the seconds.

     Their soldier faces inscrutable, TODD and RUBRICK consider the
     various lights winking on the control panel.

     RILEY points to a row of switches and looks at TODD.  Their eyes
     meet.  TODD considers the switches, then nods.

     RILEY throws the switches.  A row of red lights goes on and the
     ship seems to hum with life.

     Still communicating wordlessly, TODD points to another switch,
     RILEY throws it!

     EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY"

     BLAST OFF!  Big engines belch fire, illuminating the bleak
     landscape as the ship rises into the night.

     Brightly lit by the ignition, SLOAN, still on her belly, sees the
     ship taking off.

                                   SLOAN
                    OH, MY GOD!  OH, MY GOD!

                                   CHURCH
                    THERE IT IS!  I SEE IT!

     The bomb is clearly visible ten yards away in the dying glow of
     the takeoff.

     CHURCH bumps madly along the ground on his belly.

     EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY"

     The NAF ship "Daddy" climbs off into space, getting smaller and
     smaller, the light from the takeoff diminishing.
     EXT.  THE BOMB/TERRAIN

     The countdown timer on the bomb is faintly visible in the dying
     light.  It reads twenty seconds.

                                   CHURCH (V.O.)
                    Twenty seconds.  Hurry.

     CHURCH and SLOAN are hunched desperately over the bomb in near
     darkness, the wind tearing at them.  SLOAN tries to punch a code
     into the keys...

                                   SLOAN
                    Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's
                    six-seven or seven-six...

                                   CHURCH
                    Try one! Try it!

     SLOAN punches the keyboard blindly.

                                   SLOAN
                    There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did
                    it -- ?

     BAHWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  Everything is dazzling, blinding light!

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

     White light from the blast briefly floods the cockpit as TODD and 
     RILEY stare at the video monitor where MEKUM'S VIDEO IMAGE is
     babbling frantically.

                                   MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE
                    ...I need a report, Captain.  It's
                    not just my ass, it's yours too!
                    You've got to stand by me on this.
                    I want you to come in right now...
                    right now!  Do you understand me?
                    Right now!

     RILEY turns to TODD, looking a question at him.  TODD meets his
     look and no words are necessary.

     RILEY reaches for the control switch as MEKUM continues babbling.

                                   MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE
                    This is important for all of us, for
                    our careers.  There's going to be a
                    Board of Inquiry and --

     MEKUM'S IMAGE cuts out mid-babble.

                                   SLADE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    That was the boss, huh?

     TODD and RILEY turn to see SLADE in the entrance to the cockpit 
     addressing TODD and the VETERANS collectively.

                                   SLADE
                    Well then, I guess you fellas are
                    all right.  I guess I misjudged you
                    some.  Where I said you were "a
                    buncha no good killer robots," I
                    mighta just overspoke myself.  As of
                    now, till it goes otherwise, you got
                    my sincere approval and support.

     With that, SLADE turns and exits.

     TODD looks at RILEY, RILEY looks at TODD.  What the fuck was
     that?

     INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY" - NIGHT

     NATHAN wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself
     on a wall, keeps going.

     He passes a doorway, peers in, sees two SOLDIERS working at a
     console like robots.  They don't look up.

     NATHAN keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway.

     INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

     Entering, NATHAN moves among the legs of big men, VETERANS.
     NATHAN keeps going.

     Then, backing against a wall, he looks up and VETERANS loom past
     him with blank faces.  He is alone again.

     NATHAN totters onward.

     CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS, the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve, 
     showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space.

     TODD and RILEY are poring over them, their eyes considering dot
     after dot.  Finally, TODD points to a dot and looks a question at 
     RILEY.

     RILEY considers the dot for a long moment...then he looks TODD in
     the eye.

                                   RILEY
                    Cold.

     TODD looks back at the dot, considers it, looks back at RILEY.

                                   TODD
                    Air?

     RILEY nods a yes.

     TODD is thoughtful...finally asks the next question.

                                   TODD
                    Safe?

                                   RILEY
                         (nodding yes)
                    But very cold.

     TODD considers the dot on the map again, then looks at RILEY.

                                   TODD
                    That one.

                                   RILEY
                    Aye, aye, sir.

     RILEY turns toward a console, but something makes him look down
     toward his feat.  Then he looks back at TODD.

     TODD follows the look.

     Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD who's towering over him.

     TODD looks down without expression, the scarf from Jimmy Pig
     still wrapped around his neck.

     NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up.

     TODD considers the outstretched arms.

     RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD.  What's this?

     TODD hesitates a half second more, then leans down and picks
     NATHAN up in his arms, lifting the boy to his chest.

     RILEY looks on.  Never seen anything like it.

     NATHAN is close to TODD's face, looking right into it, trying a
     little smile, a nervous one, looking for a response.

     TODD hesitates, takes a breath, moves the muscles of his face.

     All he can produce is an awkward grimace, the distortion of a
     smile, almost comical.

     NATHAN reads the intention successfully.  His face collapses into
     a huge friendly grin.

     TODD tries again, making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince.

     RILEY watches.  Totally amazed.

     TODD turns, takes NATHAN to a porthole, puts his face up to it.

     NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars,
     a sky full of hope.

     As NATHAN looks out, TODD works his face again, trying for a
     smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight.

     NATHAN looks at the stars outside, TODD looks with him and
     suddenly TODD's face relaxes into an awkward grin, almost by
     accident.

     RILEY watches the two of them for a moment, confounded by what
     he's seeing.  Then he turns to the console and...

                      THE CLOSING CREDITS ROLL.

                               THE END
SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME

FADE IN:

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING

Winter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends,
family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S
promotion to detective, NYPD.

The party spills through the house -- front room, dining
room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond
that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their
wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from
MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the
adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her
chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a
lot of friendship here.

ANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with
his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new
gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.

                         MIKE
                  (calling to his
                   wife, for a family
                   portrait)
          Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!

ANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local
product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of
her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,
hurrying to join him.

ANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the
lips as he hooks her into his arms.

The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.
Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and
uniform read:  "FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE
KEEGAN."

SCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best
pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on
MIKE'S SHOULDER.

                         SCOTTY
                  (to Mike)
          No joke?  You're being transferred
          to the 19th as your first
          assignment?  Who the hell loves your
          ass downtown?

                         ROOKIE
                  (naively)
          What's the 21st?

BROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in.

                         SCOTTY
          What d'you care?  You'll never know.

                         BROOKLYN
          Manhattan.  The Upper East Side,
          East 59th to 96th.

The ROOKIE stares, impressed.

                         SCOTTY
                  (to the others)
          Remember Curran from the Sixteenth?
          He posted a coupla months there on a
          floater outside the French embassy.
          He met Jackie Kennedy.

                         BROOKLYN
          Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He
          probably wrote her up for letting
          her dog dump on Rockefeller's
          doorstep.

ANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato
salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN
GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on
him.

                         HELEN
          Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so
          proud of you!  What the hell took
          you so long?

                         MIKE
          Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who
          put in the good word.

ANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best
friend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with
some of the kids in the next room.

                         MIKE
          If T.J. didn't push for me, I never
          would've made it.

                         BROOKLYN
          Bet your ass... I give you six weeks
          before you're back on the beat,
          Keegan, they got no room for hero
          cops...

                         MIKE
          Appreciate, that vote of confidence,
          Brook.

                         BROOKLYN
          Hey, am I supportive, or what?

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S
date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly
sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD.
She shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with
an empty platter, catches the action.


INT.  KITCHEN - SAME

ELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters.

                         HELEN
          He left Elaine for that?

                         WIFE #1
          And what about little Scotty?

ELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE
dry.  MIKE enters to get more beers.

                         HELEN
                  (still staring)
          I'd like to tie her tits together.

                         ELLIE
          That wouldn't be too difficult.

                         MIKE
                  (overhearing)
          I bet you think she doesn't have a
          brain in her head.  I bet you think
          the only thing he sees in her is one
          incredible, dynamite body...

He GRINS at their blank stares... ELLIE'S EYES wryly
following... as he moves on out with his beers.

                         HELEN
          I love your husband, Ellie, but he's
          a real dork.

                         ELLIE
          Yeah, but he's my dork.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Night has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly,
MELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE,
dancing close, moving sensually.  It's impressive.  HELEN
convinces T.J. to DANCE.  SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too.
T.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling
Mike's hair in affection.

                         T.J.
          We're goin'.  Get some sleep,
          Detective Keegan.  You got a new job
          tomorrow.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

MIKE is holding TOMMY asleep on his shoulder.

ELLIE appears, completing the family portrait.

                         MIKE
                  (a whisper)
          Think I should put the skateboard in
          bed with him?

                         ELLIE
          Too kinky.

MIKE smiles and climbs the stairs.


INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE in the bathroom, the door open, she brushes her
hair.

MIKE in bed, thoughtful, a happy man.

                         MIKE
          Ellie, you know I think it's about
          time we got outa this place, get us
          a house of our own.  We can afford
          it now.

                         ELLIE
          Amen to that.  The supermarket's
          full of assholes.

                         MIKE
          Take my advice, don't buy any...

MIKE waits for a response.  None comes.

                         ELLIE
          Mike?

                         MIKE
                  (aware of her change
                   in tone)
          What?

                         ELLIE
          My ass if falling.

                         MIKE
          Your what...?

                         ELLIE
          My ass is falling.  It is.

                         MIKE
                  (a laugh)
          What are you talking about?

                         ELLIE
                  (appears in the door;
                   stricken)
          I just saw it in the mirror, it
          doesn't look like my ass anymore.

                         MIKE
          Get in bed.

                         ELLIE
          What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the
          exercises on TV in the morning...
          gravity...

                         MIKE
          You got a great ass!  I love your
          ass -- now get that falling ass into
          bed before it hits the floor.

She does -- the lights snap put.  They giggle, she MOVING
into his arms.

                         ELLIE
                  (a declaration)
          Tomorrow, I start looking for our
          house... You love me?

                         MIKE
                  (deeply)
          You got no idea...

                         ELLIE
          Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.

Another muted laugh -- and they move into an EMBRACE,
CAMERA PANNING WITH THEM, and then STILL FARTHER INTO THE
DARKNESS.

THE DARKNESS HOLDS.


EXT.  EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT

... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT
over the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE
CITY.


EXT.  MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT

The fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and
fulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and
beneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up --
KLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their
BLINDING BRIGHTNESS...


EXT.  CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT

A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the
hottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and
ARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young,
hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at
the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at
the private line.

A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala
is in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks
like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and
the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving
through the X-rated doorway.


INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

The latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a
breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and
dance.

There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon.

ANGLE

The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in
enchanted procession, each of them being personally
greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN
HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the
middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting.
This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and
a crossover creature to the fast life.

                         WIN
          Hi... nice to see you... thank
          you... my pleasure...

                         A MET BENEFACTRESS
                  (effusively)
          Thank you so much for agreeing to
          host us tonight.  It's really
          extraordinary!

                         WIN
          Glad I could be of help.

CAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL
STEINHART.  The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear
they are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps
forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots
CLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very
special to him...

                         WIN
          Claire!

                         CLAIRE
          Hello, Win.

And he embraces her.

                         CLAIRE
                  (introducing her
                   companion)
          You know Neil Steinhart?

He grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to
CLAIRE.

                         WIN
          Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why
          is it Claire always connects with
          the richest men this side of Saudi?

                         NEIL
                  (to Win; meaning the
                   club)
          This gives new meaning to the word
          nightlife.

WIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed
smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE:

                         WIN
          C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow
          rag trade...
                  (smiles, cutting
                   Neil out)
          You don't mind, do you?

NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as
he is addressed by someone else coming his way.


EXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window
rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the
club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the
invitees.

                         MANAGER
                  (a dilemma)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...

VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning
rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of
the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the
CORNER.


INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

WIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can
still be heard as they walk through the club.

He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection
here.

                         WIN
          Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them
          since that shitty pasta dinner on
          the cape.

                         CLAIRE
          They've got two monsters now.  Both
          boys.

                         WIN
          And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it
          serious?

                         CLAIRE
          You didn't like him?

                         WIN
          Looks a little constipated to me.

                         CLAIRE
                  (needling him)
          It's called "solid"... Nice to find
          someone you can count on, Win.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - REAR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

VENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley
outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead.

JOEY VENZA

Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European
pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT

WIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled
and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing,
indistinguishable now.  He raises his voice to be heard.

                         WIN
          The main floor stays public.  The
          side rooms we try to keep available
          for special functions like tonight.

He turns and takes her arm.

                         CLAIRE
          It's terrific Win.

                         WIN
          You still writing the occasional
          magazine article?

                         CLAIRE
          Occasionally.

                         WIN
          Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in
          the basement, you're going to get a
          privileged peek.

He leads her to the freight elevator.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          Claire!

A sociable FOURSOME descends on them.  It looks like it's
going to be a long conversation.

                         WIN
                  (to Claire, quietly)
          Just press the button all the way
          down when you're ready, okay?

He turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator,
runs into NEIL, CLAIRE'S escort.  NEIL doesn't see her.

                         NEIL
          Where's she go?

                         WIN
          Probably found somebody nicer...
          Kidding.  You're great.

He smiles, entering the elevator and disappearing from
view.  NEIL looking around, with thinly-veiled impatience,
at the benefit-types streaming into the room.


INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA navigates the labyrinth that connects to the
offices.


INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator reaches bottom.  WIN exits into an area of
tall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading.
Beyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams.

It's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area.

THE RESTAURANT GALLERY

The walls have already been painted white.  Tables have
been positioned.  Chairs are stacked, waiting.  So are
mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of
accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc.

Except for FRED, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence
is empty.

FRED scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a
curved case cutter.  Several tablefuls of unloaded
servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size
of his job.

                         WIN
          You're in overtime, Freddy.

FRED nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side
exit.

WIN, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his
powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.


INT.  MEZZANINE - NEAR ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE extricating herself; to the foursome.

                         CLAIRE
          I will... I promise...

She smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator,
pushing the down button.  The doors close.


INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA approaches an intersection.  Ahead, FRED crosses on
his way to the offices.  The elderly STOCK BOY doesn't see
VENZA, but VENZA sees him, realizing where else to look
here.


INT.  FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal
walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment.
Music and crowd noise still vibrate.  The elevator,
shuddering, continues its descent.


INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

WIN turns in the silence, looking out over the bright
space edged by darkness, every reason to be pleased.

WIN doesn't even hear VENZA enter.

                         VENZA
                  (bear, icily)
          You need money, you come to me.

WIN turns.

                         VENZA
                  (approaching,
                   soundlessly)
          Who the fuck do you think you are,
          raising cash without coming to me?

                         WIN
                  (calmer)
          Your ex-partner... I'm buying you
          out, Joey.  Read the contract.
          There's ample provision.

                         VENZA
          Fuck the contract!


INT.  ELEVATOR - BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator arrives.  The doors open.  CLAIRE steps out
into the shadowed area of stacked rows.


INT.  RESTAURANT - WIN AND VENZA

                         VENZA
                  (stares, wildly)
          Two years ago you were begging me
          for the money.  Nobody would've
          touched you...

                         WIN
          You're making an eighty percent
          return.  Which is what you wanted.

WIN turn away from VENZA.  VENZA grabs his arm violently.

                         VENZA
          Don't turn away when I'm talking to
          you.

                         WIN
                  (beat with
                   deliberation)
          Grease and water still don't mix,
          Joey.

VENZA

slashes one of the canvases (A Rosenquist) with the case
cutter... Then another...

ANGLE - WIN

                         WIN
                  (stunned)
          Jesus Christ... are you crazy?

ANGLE

Venza slashes another.

                         WIN
          Joey!

VENZA

turns, slashing WIN.

WIN

gasps.  Blood begins to seep from his wound.

ANGLE - CLAIRE

hearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S
saying something she's supposed to respond to.

VENZA

slashing WIN again, losing all control.

                         WIN
                  (staggering back)
          Jesus...!

CLAIRE ROUNDS THE CORNER

Seeing WIN, she stops.

ANGLE

VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor.

CLAIRE

screams, unable to imagine or believe it.

VENZA

looks up, hearing her.

WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet.
VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to
concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together.  He
puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her.

CLAIRE

steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator,
running.

VENZA

quickens his step, after her.

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR

as she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the
BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED.  But VENZA
is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them.  The
doors CLOSE on his fingers.  He cries out, pulling his
fingers free.  He slams his fist against the doors as they
close shut, POUNDS the button again.

ANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE

But CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the
elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and
somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to
RING.

Relentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE

giving way in the darkened cubicle.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAIRE

sagging against the elevator wall, weeping, hearing
VENZA'S FRANTIC BREATHING on the other side subside, and
finally move away in the darkness.


INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGING -- a hand fumbling on the telephone in
the darkness.  WE HEAR MIKE'S VOICE as he turns on the
light.

                         MIKE
          T.J...?  Is this a joke?  Are you
          kidding me?
                  (listening, not
                   liking what he
                   hears)
          Give me 20 minutes.

MIKE hanging up the phone, turns to ELLIE.

                         ELLIE
                  (mumbling from under
                   the covers)
          Switch the light off on your way
          out.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

MIKE and T.J. disheveled and tired, drinking out of
styrofoam coffee cups, arriving at the club.

                         T.J.
                  (grinning)
          Hey Mike, out of the bag into the
          bureau, huh... How do you like it so
          far?

                         MIKE
                  (giving a half smile)
          Right behind you, T.J.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

A rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off
strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled
with POLICEMEN (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying
to ride herd on the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, in contrasting
attire.

The man in charge and coping is LIEUTENANT GARBER; in
plainclothes, fiftyish, rough-hewn.

                         GARBER
          Did you ever hear the chatter.
          They're worse than fuckin' four-
          year-olds... Miller, let's clear
          this path here, all right?

T.J. and MIKE arrive.

                         GARBER
                  (to them, on the
                   move)
          Blood bath downstairs.  The owner of
          this place is dead.  And I got a
          witness, and a suspect... Joey
          Venza.

T.J. reacts to the name.

                         T.J.
          Where's Venza?

                         GARBER
          Nice question.  I like questions
          like that.

A massive "GASP" goes up from the CROWD as a cumbersome
BODYBAG is brought up a stairwell from downstairs.  GARBER
temporarily moves away to oversee.

                         MIKE
                  (to T.J.)
          Who's Joey Venza?

                         T.J.
          Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families
          dropped him when they found they had
          a fruitcake on their hands.  But he
          knows where a lot of bodies are
          buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if
          he could bring him in.

                         GARBER
                  (returning, re: the
                   crowd)
          Okay, let's find out what we know.
          Herd'm up and check'm out.  Anybody
          know more than gossip about the
          deceased or Venza, I wanna talk to
          them myself.  Go.

T.J. moves into action with typical "T.J. style"
diplomacy.

                         T.J.
          Okay, will all the beautiful people
          shut the fuck up, before it starts
          gettin' real ugly here!

The uniformed COPS take their cue, moving in for quiet.

                         GARBER
                  (to Mike, the "new
                   boy")
          Keegan, go baby-sit the witness.
          Just sit and look impressive.  Make
          her feel protected.  And if you can
          get her boyfriend outa my hair, I'll
          promote you to fuckin' Joint
          Chiefs...

EXT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - CLUB - NIGHT

A uniformed COP guarding the door as MIKE approaches,
flashing his shield.

                         COP
          Quit playing with yourself, Keegan.
          I know who you are.

                         MIKE
                  (grinning)
          A Detective's supposed to identify
          himself.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - NIGHT

The room is dim, lit only by a desk lamp, CLAIRE seated on
a couch, catatonic, NEIL kneading her hand, trying to
comfort her.  A KNOCK at the DOOR:  NEIL JUMPS UP to open
it -- MIKE ENTERING before he gets there.

                         NEIL
                  (upset)
          Are you in charge here?

                         MIKE
          No, sir...

                         NEIL
          I asked for the man in charge...

                         MIKE
          That would be Lieutenant Garber, and
          he's very busy upstairs...

                         NEIL
          Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked
          for an ambulance for this woman
          and...

                         MIKE
          Is she injured?

                         CLAIRE
                  (softly)
          No.

MIKE gets his first view of her as she TURNS her head into
the light.  It is an almost storybook vision of beauty
that emerges from the darkness around her; her
vulnerability penetrates to the very core.

                         NEIL
                  (to Claire)
          You're not going to talk to anyone
          without a lawyer.

                         MIKE
          She's not a suspect, sir, she's a
          witness.  Could I ask you to step
          outside, please.

                         NEIL
          No, I will not step outside.

                         MIKE
          Sir, I am just trying to do my job,
          it's standard procedure to question
          the witness alone.  Help me out
          here, could you please leave.

                         NEIL
                  (icily)
          I don't really see what that has to
          do with...

                         CLAIRE
                  (deadened; to Neil)
          Neil, do what he says.

ANGLE ON MIKE AND NEIL:  at a standoff.

                         CLAIRE
                  (quietly)
          Please.

MIKE OPENS THE DOOR for NEIL.  NEIL reluctantly swallows
it.

                         NEIL
          I'll be right outside.

NEIL grudgingly leaves.  MIKE quietly closes the door.

ANGLE CHANGE:  CLAIRE and MIKE alone.  He sits down.  A
beat.

                         MIKE
          Can I get you a cup of coffee or
          something?

Her plaintive eyes turning to meet his.

                         CLAIRE
                  (lost)
          I've never seen anyone killed
          before.

                         MIKE
          It's okay... I've never been a
          detective before either...

She lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile.  She
returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness,
and curiously reassured.

                         MIKE
          We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get
          through it together.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

PHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS TYPING, BODIES moving at
cross-current -- CAMERA FINDING LIEUTENANT GARBER,
hustling through the bullpen, MIKE FOLLOWING, toward his
office.

                         GARBER
          I don't know how you did it, but
          whatever it was, keep doing it.

                         MIKE
                  (puzzled)
          I just sat and listened.

                         GARBER
          Safe and secure is how we want her.
          Until she I.D.'s Venza.

T.J. has joined them.

                         GARBER
          Venza's either going to skip or try
          to get to her and Venza likes it
          here.  I want her ass covered, 24
          hour protection, but I don't want
          her to know there is any real
          danger.

                         T.J.
          I don't like what I'm hearing...

                         MIKE
                  (to Garber)
          I don't understand.  If there's any
          danger, why not just level with
          her...

GARBER turns back to MIKE

                         GARBER
                  (with mock tolerance)
          T.J. your friend's a little dense.
          When she realizes there's a killer
          tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on
          the next plane for Tahiti... somehow
          I think my way is better.

He MOVES ON, leaving them not very happy.

                         MIKE
          Chief?

GARBER turns back.

                         MIKE
          Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as
          good a job.

                         GARBER
          When I want your advise, Keegan,
          I'll make an appointment.

GARBER MOVES ON OUT.  MIKE and T.J. left alone.

                         MIKE
                  (disappointed)
          Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first
          detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!
                  (turning to T.J.)
          I got a 'choice' at all.

                         T.J.
          Do it, or look for another
          profession.  That's a choice I
          guess.

                         MIKE
          You in this with me?

                         T.J.
          Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.


EXT.  BACK OF MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY

ELLIE IS SEEN unloading groceries from the rear of a small
hatchback...


INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY

MIKE is in the kitchen; he's making eggs in agitation,
throwing in everything he can find (tuna fish, chopped
pickles, mustard), his kid, TOMMY, in evidence in the
b.g., on a SKATEBOARD, whizzing through the kitchen, even
RIDING IT down the STAIRS.

MIKE MOVES TO A CABINET -- and his FEET GO OUT FROM UNDER
HIM.  He's slipped on a SKATEBOARD -- barely catching
himself in time.

                         MIKE
                  (yelling)
          Tommy!  Goddamnit!  Get these
          skateboards off the goddamn kitchen
          floor!

TOMMY whizzes through, expertly picking it up "on the
move," MIKE taking a futile swipe at him.

                         TOMMY
          What're we having?

                         MIKE
          My special, scrambled eggs surprise.

                         TOMMY
                  (frowns dubiously)
          Scrambled eggs surprise?

TOMMY goes whizzing on out again.  ELLIE comes in loaded
up with the groceries.  Puts them down, giving MIKE a
kiss.

                         ELLIE
          So how'd it go?

                         MIKE
          Not great.  I've got a babysitting
          job for a material witness on a
          homicide.

It explains his mood.  ELLIE starts putting away the
groceries.

                         ELLIE
          For how long?

                         MIKE
          'Til they pick up the perp.
                  (he sits)
          Seniority gets day shift... You know
          what that means.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  she sits, realizing, upset, but taking it
in stride, now putting plates on the table.

                         ELLIE
          Well, I'll live with it, I've lived
          with it all my life.  My Dad was a
          cop, he said, "whatever you do,
          honey, never go out with a cop".
          So, what did I do?  I got a job with
          the cops.  Then I married a cop.  I
          probably gave birth to a cop.
                  (shouting)
          Tommy!  Come over here and eat, it's
          hot.

TOMMY enters.

                         MIKE
          Maybe you and Tommy should stay with
          my Mom.

ELLIE makes an expression of dislike.

                         MIKE
          Don't start... The only reason is
          that the neighborhood's shi...
                  (realizing that
                   Tommy is listening)
          ... crummy.  I just don't like the
          idea of leaving you alone here at
          night.

                         ELLIE
          I can still use a gun.

                         MIKE
          Just keep it someplace safe, but
          handy.

TOMMY joins then at the table.

                         TOMMY
                  (zooming in)
          Keep what handy?

                         ELLIE
          Nothing.

                         TOMMY
          The gun?  It's in the upstairs
          closet.

                         MIKE
          How do you know where the gun is?

                         TOMMY
          I know where everything is.

                         MIKE
          Except the goddamn skateboards,
          which are everywhere!  I'd like to
          kill the guy who invented those
          things.

                         TOMMY
          Lay back, Mack.

                         MIKE
          Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay
          back, Mack?"
                  (to Ellie)
          Where does he get this?

Silence; they eat... ELLIE'S eyes finding MIKE'S.

                         ELLIE
          Keep the weekends for us, huh?  Get
          a replacement for Saturday nights.
          That'll give us the weekends
          together.

TOMMY'S face screws up, tasting the lump of food in his
mouth.

                         TOMMY
          God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?!
          These are pickles...!  God!

                         MIKE
          Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MANHATTAN - FIFTH AVENUE - EARLY EVENING

Mike emerges from the subway alongside the park.


EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING

Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's
children returning from music lessons.

Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly
tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny
pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This
is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled
civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens
or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot.


INT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING

A notice behind the locked front door informs:  "ALL
VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".  MIKE displays his shield to
the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking
the time to inspect his credentials before returning them,
then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY.


INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME

MIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls.


INT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME

The elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall-
papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings.

The front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the
cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional
civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him
in.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Marble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial;
MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where
the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE,
and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to
be "in charge".

                         GARBER
                  (approaching Mike)
          You remember Detective Keegan?

                         NEIL
                  (expressionless)
          I do.

The doorbell RINGS AGAIN:  MARY goes to answer it as MIKE
mumbles his greetings to all -- noticing that CLAIRE,
reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out -- or is it
"disinterested"?

                         NEIL
          I want to make sure that everyone
          respects the privacy of Miss
          Gregory's household.  You're limited
          to the outer vestibule, so you can
          watch the elevator, the kitchen, so
          you can get something to eat, and
          the washroom.

                         T.J.
                  (under his breath to
                   Mike)
          So you can take a shit.

The THIRD DETECTIVE enters, being led by MARY.  It's
KOONTZ, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you
definitely don't take home to mother.

                         MIKE
                  (reacting; to T.J.)
          Not Koontz.

                         T.J.
          Be happy.  He's good at this.

                         GARBER
                  (to Neil)
          We'd like to, just once, get a look
          at the entire layout, so we can
          evaluate security.

                         CLAIRE
          This really isn't necessary.  The
          security in this building is about
          the best in the city.

                         GARBER
                  (ever the diplomat)
          I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory,
          but I'd consider it a favor if you'd
          let us look around.

                         CLAIRE
          Be my guest.

                         GARBER
                  (to his troops)
          Guys.

ANGLE - HALLWAY

as GARBER withdraws; MIKE, T.J., KOONTZ to start their
check.

                         MIKE
                  (to Garber)
          What about when she goes out?

                         GARBER
          Discourage it.  But stay with her if
          you can't.  Call it in first so we
          can have a car on tail.  She's
          agreed to travel only with her own
          driver and limousine... okay, let's
          check it out.

They split up.

ANGLE - MIKE

following orders, continues down the hall.  He moves to a
door that he ATTEMPTS TO OPEN -- discovering it's not
real.  It's a TROMPE L'OEIL.  He turns around to find he's
not alone in the long hall.  NEIL stands just outside the
living room, watching him.

                         MIKE
                  (re: the "door")
          Pretty good.

ANGLE - NEIL

turns, returning to CLAIRE in the LIVING ROOM.

                         NEIL
          Why an I reminded of the Three
          Stooges?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

KOONTZ checking the windows and terrace.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - SAME

MIKE, MARY the MAID in there with him.

                         MARY
                  (officiously)
          You a vegetarian?  Miss Gregory's a
          vegetarian, so I'm gonna put food
          for you people in a separate fridge.
          You know how to use a microwave?
                  (before he can
                   answer)
          Just about everything you'd want
          will heat up by turning this to
          ninety seconds.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - SAME

Utterly sumptuous; T.J. uttering a low "whistle" of awe.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S POWDER ROOM

There's an enormous circular bathtub and a Jacuzzi,
endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place one
could spend one's life in -- MIKE SEEN, in the MIRRORS,
wandering through -- idly pushing a mirrored door open, to
gaze, in awe, at the walk-in closet.

                         MIKE
                  (under his breath)
          Fuckin' A.

ANGLE:  He see T.J., or what he thinks is T.J., reflected
among the other reflections at the other end of the room.
Sees T.J. sit on edge of bed.  MIKE is standing in center
of the MIRRORS, slightly disoriented.  And T.J. sees him,
similarly astounded, MOVING OUT OF SHOT.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Moving inward, he gawks at the racks of
clothes, gently brushing his hand through the lush
fabrics.  CLAIRE'S VOICE -- ANGRY, ALMOST TREMBLING, A
FIRM EFFORT OF WILL -- rustles the silence behind him.

                         CLAIRE
          Excuse me.

ANGLE ON CLAIRE

                         CLAIRE
          This is my dressing room, and these
          are my clothes.
                  (holding herself
                   firm)
          I understand your responsibilities...
          but I'd appreciate you staying out
          of here at all times.

MIKE:  chastened, nods.

                         MIKE
          Sorry.  Just checking.

He starts away.  MOMENTARILY baffled by the MANY-ANGLED
REFLECTIONS OF HIMSELF in the MIRRORS.

                         CLAIRE
          Straight ahead.

                         MIKE
          Hard to find doors in this place.

MIKE:  embarrassed, apologetic.

                         CLAIRE
          ... Detective Keegan, I hope you
          understand how upsetting this is?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S OUTER VESTIBULE - NIGHT

All silent; MIKE on "watch".  Just him and a wooden desk
chair, the grade-school variety.  No books, no crossword
puzzles; he came unprepared.  He checks his watch and
looks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picks
up an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settles
for sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.
Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and
makes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly
pushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the
quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVING
ROOM.  It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as
though to estimate their height.

Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he
crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading
material.

They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,
because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.
But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he
HEARS VOICES.  CLAIRE'S and NEIL'S; her tone is agitated.

                         NEIL (O.S.)
                  (barely audible)
          ... just saying you should think
          twice about it...

                         CLAIRE (O.S.)
          ... I don't want to talk about it...

CLOSE ON MIKE:  book under his arm, quietly moving toward
the SOURCE:  the DEN.  It's door is slightly ajar; there
is a suitcase in front of it, ready for travel.


INT.  DEN - NIGHT

                         CLAIRE
          ... You know, and I know, that the
          only thing standing between a life
          sentence for Venza and his freedom
          is my testimony at his trial...

                         NEIL
          Claire...

                         CLAIRE
          ... He killed Win... he enjoyed
          it...

                         NEIL
          Win made his choices, Claire.  We
          all do --

                         CLAIRE
          And I'm making mine.

She looks at him; a beat, emotionally.  He remains steady.

                         NEIL
                  (gently)
          You're dealing with a psychopath.
          He gets out of jail in ten years, or
          five... or ninety days, and you'll
          be looking over your shoulder for
          the rest of your life...

                         CLAIRE
          What am I supposed to do?!  I saw
          one of my oldest friends get killed!
          And I saw who did it!
                  (through tears)
          I can't just -- "let it go away"!!

                         NEIL
                  (gently)
          Claire...

ANGLE - DEN.  NEIL takes her in his arms, holding her
tightly, affectionately, protectively.  Holding her from
behind, NEIL KISSES CLAIRE gently on her neck.  She calms
in his arms.

RETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and
dining rooms until he's in the kitchen.


INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Spotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English
muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on.

But he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going
on in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE
WHISTLES, trying not to.

The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately
pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly
fanning the air.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT
ALONE.  He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper,
not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on,
fluffing her collar, ready to go home.

                         MIKE
                  (chagrined)
          I like 'em toasty.

ANGLE ON MARY:  staring at him, amused.

                         MARY
          Good night, Mr. Keegan.

She moves through the kitchen and EXITS.


INT.  VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT

NEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving.  He crosses
from the hallway.

The TWO EYE EACH OTHER:  MIKE attempting a cordial smile.

                         NEIL
          You're here 'til what time?

                         MIKE
          I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

NEIL noticing the Renoir.

                         NEIL
          When you're through with it, put it
          back, please, exactly where you
          found it, and don't use the library
          again.  I have to leave town for a
          few days.  Let's do everything we
          can to make this less of a trial for
          her, shall we?

MIKE NODS.  But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock
"military salute"; a click of the heels.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER

2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE
alone.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir.
Like a man making the most of solitary confinement --
becoming aware of a NOISE.  Though hard to make out in
this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs
life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward,
studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment,
left slightly ajar.

ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he
wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a
drawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the
light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her
-- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  SUBWAY - ON THE MOVE - LATER

The uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY
SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set
into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its
DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until
we can make out the word "QUEENS".


EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS

The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE
picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it,
sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second
page.  He heads inwards...

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Afternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the
SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then "chug-chugging" to
another start, gasping, then revving.  Someone's working
on MIKE'S car.  He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in
the afternoon.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY

ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on
MIKE'S car.  ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans,
the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to
"try it again".  It looks like no one's behind the wheel;
but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to
reach the accelerator.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  appearing at the door, in a freshly
pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.  He walks
across the lawn towards them.

                         MIKE
          Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to
          my car?

ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.

                         ELLIE
          Changing the sparks.  They showed it
          on TV.  What d'you think?

                         MIKE
          I think television's a dangerous
          thing.

                         ELLIE
          It's twenty bucks in the bank.

Slamming the hood.  TOMMY revs the engine ELLIE moving
down the steps towards MIKE.

                         ELLIE
          Enough, Tommy!  C'mon.  Get out of
          there!

ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his
underpants:  Their eyes meet, lovingly.  She laughs.

                         MIKE
          Hey.  The neighbors.

                         ELLIE
          Let 'em eat their hearts out.

She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE,
checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's
left there.  MIKE adjusts his tie.  It's very colorful.

                         ELLIE
          I read the article.  You didn't tell
          me she was so beautiful.

                         MIKE
                  (Mister Honest)
          Well, actually, she looks better
          than that.

ELLIE playfully makes a move, JABBING AT HIM, MIKE stops
her, ending WITH A HUG.

                         MIKE
          I've got to go.

MIKE kisses her.  ELLIE holds MIKE'S face with her gloved
hand.

                         MIKE
          See you Tommy.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  as TOMMY comes up and leans against his
mom:  both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke.
MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.

                         MIKE
          Okay?

                         ELLIE
          Unbelievably handsome.  You look
          fantastic in a suit.

                         TOMMY
          Nice threads Dad.

                         MIKE
          Yeah, I think so.

MIKE leaves.


INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT

The WALL CLOCK reads 6:30.  The remains of a teeny gourmet
meal, before him on the kitchen table.

MIKE is playing an improvised hockey game, shooting peas
through a goal made up of two water glasses, using his
knife as a hockey stick.  He HEARS the CLICK of HIGH HEELS
approaching, crossing the vast marble floors.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE coming toward -- clearly
dressed for the evening, her stride signaling
determination.

                         MIKE
                  (brilliant)
          Hi.

                         CLAIRE
          I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this
          works.  I have to go out... is that
          all right?

                         MIKE
                  (unprepared)
          Uh...

                         CLAIRE
          I have to pick something up before
          Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a
          reception just a few blocks away.

                         MIKE
                  (faltering)
          I think, maybe, that isn't such a
          great idea...

                         CLAIRE
          Lieutenant Garber said that in all
          likelihood there was no real danger,
          is that true?

                         MIKE
          Right.  That's true.

                         CLAIRE
          Can we go then?

                         MIKE
          I'm supposed to call in.

                         CLAIRE
          There's a phone in the car.

She MOVES TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR:  MIKE, stymied.


INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME - NIGHT

They descend in silence, MIKE aware of being scrutinized.
The ELEVATOR STOPS, MIKE about to get off, realizing
they're stopped at the THIRD FLOOR, another TENANT
stepping on.  He's dressed in an expensive JOGGING SUIT,
his key dangling from around his neck; he nods to CLAIRE
and pushes "DOWN".  The elevator RUMBLES downward.

                         CLAIRE
          Do you have another tie?  Something
          more conservative?

                         MIKE
                  (confused, then
                   realizing)
          Oh... Yes... I don't have it with
          me.  It's at home.


EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - SAME - NIGHT

The JOGGER first out the door, taking off with fierce
determination, followed by MIKE, who nervously checks the
street, then opens the limo door and checks inside, then,
finally, MOTIONS CLAIRE OUT.  She moves smoothly into the
limo; MIKE checks traffic behind them, then gets in,
after.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LIMO - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE fumbles, searching the console for the car phone.
She finds it easily, picks it up.

                         CLAIRE
          What's the number?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - GARBER'S OFFICE

GARBER is on the other end of the line.

                         GARBER
          Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic.
          Fucking shopping.
                  (he thinks)
          I don't see that we have much
          choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her
          she's a fucking lunatic.

GARBER slams down the phone.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIMO - NIGHT

MIKE sets down the phone.

                         CLAIRE
          What did he say?

                         MIKE
          He thinks you're being a little
          careless.  He made the point several
          times.

MIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to
feel "comfortable" in one another's presence.  It's plenty
awkward.

                         CLAIRE
          You live in Manhattan?

                         MIKE
          Queens... You know Queens?

                         CLAIRE
          My father founded a music school
          there.  The Milton Gregory School.

He politely tries to place it, with no idea.

                         CLAIRE
          I'm supposed to speak at their tenth
          anniversary.

                         MIKE
          Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have
          an aperitif...

It evokes a slight smile but nothing more.

                         MIKE
          Maybe not.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  5TH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

The limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it
stops moving.

It's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere;
a PATROLMAN notices from the curb.

                         MIKE
                  (to the driver)
          Don't move it.

He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip
on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in.

ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS

MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing
shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the
fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her
effortlessly in, zip.

ANGLE:  CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased.


INT.  FIFTH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

They cross toward the up escalator; she knows where she's
going.

                         PERFUME LADY
          Hello, Miss Gregory.

CLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert,
scrutinizing the crowd.  He gets on right behind.  They
ascend.

At the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO
HER.  CLAIRE flinches.  MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front,
quickly handling the guy.  The MAN jumps back.

                         DARK-SUITED MAN
          I'm sorry... I thought this was
          down...

ANGLE ON MIKE; SHAKEN.  CLAIRE giving him a long unsteady
look, too.

                         CLAIRE
          Are you nervous?

                         MIKE
          No, Ma'am.

INT.  SHOP - GIFT COUNTER - NIGHT

MIKE keeping close watch as CLAIRE approves her purchase:
a silver frame, containing an inscribed photo of CLAIRE
and an elegant older woman.

                         CLAIRE
          Would you wrap it for me, I'll be
          back in a moment.

CLAIRE walks past MIKE.

                         CLAIRE
          Could you come with me please.

MIKE follows her.

CLAIRE at the TIE COUNTER, points to the tie rack.

                         CLAIRE
          Would you pick one out, please?

                         MIKE
          Beg pardon?

                         CLAIRE
          Since you're going to be my escort,
          you'll need a new tie.

MIKE begins to connect, glancing down again at the tie
he's wearing.  CLAIRE selects a TIE, turning to the
SALESPERSON, for his reaction.

                         SALESPERSON
          Perfect.

CLAIRE handing it to the SALESPERSON.

                         CLAIRE
          Put it on my account, please.

                         MIKE
          I got money.

CLAIRE gives a look to the clerk to go ahead with her
order.  SALESPERSON goes off.

                         CLAIRE
          If we had more time we'd work on the
          suit too.

INT.  THE LIMO - IN MOTION - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE AND CLAIRE; CLAIRE favorably assessing him in the new
tie.

                         CLAIRE
          You look quite elegant, actually.

He looks down at it in silence; then, finally:

                         MIKE
          My wife likes this suit.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  his vulnerability makes her smile.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

Clearly a "big deal," with Kleig lights and heavy
LIMOUSINE and TAXI traffic being directed into place by
COPS, some of whom we recognize.

ANGLE ON A PAIR OF COPS, using flashlights to guide
traffic -- spotting CLAIRE'S LIMOUSINE with the BLACK-AND-
WHITE PATROL CAR following it, and signaling it into
place.

                         TRAFFIC COP
                  (re: Claire's limo)
          Bring it in, close.

The COP OPENS THE DOOR -- stunned to see MIKE STEP OUT, in
suit and new tie -- looking like he belongs there.

                         COP
          Jesus Christ.

                         MIKE
          I'm on duty.

                         COP
          What kind of work?  Gigolo?

CLAIRE steps out, utterly elegant, taking MIKE'S arm --
the traffic COPS now joined by those from the BLACK-AND-
WHITE, as MIKE and CLAIRE head INWARD.  The COPS wolf-
whistle MIKE and razz him as they go, some beginning the
STRAINS of "Just a Gigolo"...

MIKE GIVES THEM THE FINGER behind his back.

INT.  THE RECEPTION - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE and CLAIRE caught in a crush of people jamming the
ENTRANCE WAY -- their bodies coming into close contact, so
close that MIKE is forced into an awkward posture in order
to stay close to her; one arm up in the air, uncomfortable
about taking her arm.

                         CLAIRE
          You can touch me, I won't bite.

                         MIKE
          Not too sure about that.

He takes her arm, guiding her through the crowd.

The SOUND of a WOMAN'S (MARGE GOODWIN) VOICE attracts
their attention.

                         MARGE
                  (pushing through)
          CLAIRE!  Claire!  Darling!  Are you
          all right?

She's a SOCIETY MATRON-TYPE, grabbing CLAIRE in an ever-
so-concerned HUG.

                         MARGE
          My God!  I couldn't believe... my
          poor darling... and Win Hockings...!
          Antonia'll be so happy you're here,
          she says a "Lifetime Achievement
          Award" is like being invited to your
          own funeral while you're still
          alive...

But ANTONIA, an elegant OLDER WOMAN, has already SPOTTED
HER.

                         ANTONIA
          Claire...!

She pushes through, and fairly falls into CLAIRE'S arms.
ANTONIA almost emotionally overcome, that CLAIRE has
managed it.

                         CLAIRE
          I wouldn't have missed it, Tony.

                         ANTONIA
          You look so beautiful...

ANTONIA looks up to see MIKE.

                         CLAIRE
          This is Mike Keegan, the policeman
          assigned to protect me.  Antonia
          Bolt...

She looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the
same.

                         MARGE
                  (change of tone)
          Hello.

                         CLAIRE
                  (introducing)
          Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is
          Mike Keegan...

                         MIKE
                  (ultra respectful)
          Hello...
                  (a deferential nod
                   to Antonia)
          ... Ma'am.

                         ANTONIA
                  (liking him; to
                   Claire)
          He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle.
                  (re: Mike's
                   embarrassed
                   reaction)
          And he blushes.  I like that.  Take
          good care of her.


INT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT

CLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW --
occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a
wall, ever watchful...

CLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING
come up to him; just "oozing" seduction.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          I hear you're a policeman.

MIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE.

                         MIKE
          Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          Ever shot anyone?

                         MIKE
          Yes.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          Does it make you... hard?

                         MIKE
          ... Hard?

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd
          heard that it gives you a boner, to
          shoot a man.

MIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment.

                         MIKE
          Would you excuse me, please?

HE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye.

                         MIKE
          Would you consider leaving here
          pretty soon?

CLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time.

                         CLAIRE
          People think I'm stepping out on
          Neil.  We're causing quite a
          scandal.

                         MIKE
                  (confidential)
          Hey!  There are crazy people here.

                         CLAIRE
          Let's get a drink.

                         MIKE
          Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.

She plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom
entrance, MIKE following.

                         CLAIRE
          I'll have a spritzer, order
          something soft for yourself... I
          must go for a pee.

                         MIKE
          I'll come with you.

                         CLAIRE
          I think I can probably do that on my
          own.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies'
room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns
back to the bar, which is very busy and confused.

                         MIKE
                  (irritated)
          Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka
          martini.

MIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing.

                         MIKE
          Make it a double.

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

as a pair of WOMEN finish their "touch-up" and head out,
making way for CLAIRE to step up to the mirror to assess
herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse
down she moves to a stall and enters.

INT.  BAR COUNTER - NIGHT

EXIT, then turns to the BARMAN to receive the drinks.

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME

LOW ANGLE on the door -- as a pair of men's shoes pass
through frame.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE, inside a stall SHE HEARS FOOTSTEPS
QUIETLY ENTER, followed by a CLICK of a DOOR.  It's not
the click of a stall door, because the FOOTSTEPS then
proceed inward; WE HEAR A STALL DOOR CLOSE and LOCK.  It
gives her momentary pause, but she dismisses it, looking
for her purse -- realizing she left it on the sink --
opening her stall door and heading out.

She barely hears the "click" of the bolt sliding behind
her -- and looks up, into the MIRROR, SEEING VENZA appear
behind her.  She SPINS -- but doesn't have time to CRY
OUT.  He's grabbed her by the THROAT.

INT.  BALLROOM - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

MIKE and the PRETTY YOUNG THING:  she doesn't notice him
trying to drift away.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          You know what?  I don't think you're
          a policeman at all.  I think you're
          just some schmuck who uses that
          "policeman" line as a come-on.

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE attempting to breathe -- her FACE being brought to
within an inch of his.

                         VENZA
          Christ, you're one beautiful woman.
          I could kill you right now, but I'm
          not gonna... 'cause you're gonna
          help me.  You're gonna see me in a
          police line-up and say it wasn't me.
          And if you don't do that, someone
          will come after you.  They're gonna
          find you dead, with your face
          missing -- understood... Good...
          Because otherwise, it'd be this
          easy.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  her eyes wide with TERROR.  He rubs his
thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick.

                         VENZA
          Now walk outta here.  And if you
          ever see me again... you never saw
          me before.

To make his point, he SQUEEZES HARDER -- CLAIRE'S eyes
bulging, as TEARS run from her eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MUSEUM - UPPER TIER - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE, finally putting distance between him and the "PRETTY
YOUNG THING."

ANGLE:  MIKE, as he catches sight of a back of a man
(VENZA) moving out of the ladies' room.  Stunned, MIKE
PIVOTS, TURNING, SPRINTING IN THE DIRECTION of the ladies'
room.

OUTSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  Two women just go in.  MIKE
pushes his way in, slamming the door behind him.  The
OTHER WOMEN GASP, seeing MIKE invading their sanctuary.

INSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  MIKE

CLOSE ON MIKE:  RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE,
disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and
face, but otherwise uninjured.

MIKE turns, calling to the TWO WOMEN coming in.

                         MIKE
          Take care of her!

MIKE TAKES OFF AFTER VENZA --


INT.  UPPER TIER

OUT OF LADIES' ROOM, AND UP THE RAMP TO THE NEAREST (THE
UPPER) LEVEL.

ANGLE:  He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR.  These is
only one place for it to go -- DOWN.  MIKE CHANGES
DIRECTION and FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP
trying to keep pace with the descent of the elevator.  At
the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and VENZA
EXITS AMIDST THE PARTY.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  VENZA MAKES HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE
AND EXITS THE BUILDING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  MIKE HURTLES DOWN THE RAMP AND DESPERATELY
FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE CENTER of the PARTY and OUT the
FRONT ENTRANCE.

MIKE EXITS the BUILDING bewildered; lost him... RUNS
BLINDLY amidst PEDESTRIANS -- SPOTS VENZA AHEAD.

ANGLE ON VENZA reaching someone MIKE CAN'T SEE.  MIKE puts
his hand in his jacket for his gun.

                         MIKE
          Venza!

VENZA HEARS and SLOWS, but DOESN'T TURN.  ONLOOKERS turn.
VENZA is talking to someone, taking his time.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  untroubled, turning; raising his arms,
and SMILING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  confused -- seeing that the man VENZA
stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give
himself up.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  breathless as he moves toward VENZA.  MIKE
frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.

MIKE and T.J. with GARBER, MIKE being CONGRATULATED by
COPS who pass.  But GARBER doesn't look happy.

                         MIKE
                  (protesting)
          But I got him!  He's in jail!
          Wasn't that the point...?!

                         GARBER
          You apprehended him after he gave
          himself up --

                         MIKE
          It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave
          himself up because he knew I was
          gonna nab him.

                         GARBER
          Anyone who turns himself in makes a
          good case for bail.

                         MIKE
          Even Joey Venza?!

                         GARBER
          He's got a good lawyer, and he made
          a smart move.  We've got a scared
          witness and a suspect who proved
          "good will" by turning himself in.

                         MIKE
                  (protesting)
          What about when she identifies him?!

                         GARBER
          If she identifies him.
                  (turns, unloading on
                   him)
          Where the fuck were you anyway,
          cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked
          right past you, and now we're the
          ones playing catch-up!  You better
          hope she identifies him.

GARBER turns on his heel, ENTERING HIS OFFICE; leaving
MIKE looking at T.J.  Dismayed.

                         T.J.
          Wasn't your fault.

                         MIKE
                  (exasperated)
          It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!

EXT.  TRACT HOME - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - AFTERNOON

A tree-lined neighborhood.  The house has a FOR SALE sign
in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed
for work -- he looks around.  The cab pulls out, he heads
for the front door.


INT.  TRACT HOME - AFTERNOON

MIKE enters the house.  It's nothing special.  ELLIE is in
another room.  She joins MIKE.

                         ELLIE
          The real estate lady left, she
          couldn't wait anymore.  What took
          you?

                         MIKE
                  (upset)
          Oh, some shit.

                         ELLIE
          What shit, honey?

                         MIKE
          You don't want to hear about it.

ELLIE begins to show him the place.

                         ELLIE
          ... Look at the fireplace.  You
          don't get workmanship like that
          anymore.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  preoccupied.

                         ELLIE
          Ninety-seven five.  What do you
          think?

He nods, trying hard to "be there," but ELLIE isn't
fooled; she assesses him with concern.

                         ELLIE
          Honey.  You got him.

                         MIKE
          I don't know that Ellie.  He might
          get out.  Garber's not bein'
          straight with the witness, she could
          be in deep shit if she identifies
          him, and it's my job to convince her
          she won't be.

                         ELLIE
                  (the voice of
                   sanity)
          She's got to identify him.

                         MIKE
          Why?

                         ELLIE
                  (taken aback)
          Because the the only way to stop
          crime is to identify criminals.  I
          can't believe you're talking this
          way Mister Detective -- I think
          she's got a lot of guts.

                         MIKE
          I think -- she's crazy.

                         ELLIE
          I'd identify him.

                         MIKE
          I might stop you.

A beat.

                         ELLIE
          Oh I can see you've had a bad day.
          We'll see the house another time,
          okay?

                         MIKE
                  (trying to recover)
          No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven
          five right?

                         ELLIE
          Where'd you get the tie?

He's wearing the tie CLAIRE bought him.

                         MIKE
                  (distracted)
          Bought it.

                         ELLIE
          It's not your taste.

                         MIKE
          What did she say the down payment
          was?

PAUSE.  DEAD SILENCE.

                         MIKE
          She didn't like the other one, so
          she picked this one.

                         ELLIE
          She took you shopping for a tie?

                         MIKE
          I had to follow her to a store.

                         ELLIE
          What's wrong with your paisley tie?

                         MIKE
          Ellie, it was a formal party...

                         ELLIE
          Excuse me!  You went to a party with
          her?

                         MIKE
          I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...

                         ELLIE
          I know you're her bodyguard.  Did
          she buy it or did you?

                         MIKE
          She bought it.

                         ELLIE
          Why?

                         MIKE
          I don't know why she bought me a
          tie! -- She's a generous person --
          and she's a nice person -- and I
          could be settin' her up to be
          killed... you want the fuckin' tie?

His VOICE resonates through the empty house, creating a
ringing silence.  ELLIE begins to giggle.

                         ELLIE
                  (joking)
          No, I don't want the 'fuckin'" tie
          -- I'm sorry --
                  (conciliatory)
          I'm glad she bought you a tie.  You
          needed one.  You look good in that
          tie.
                  (a beat)
          Next time you two go shopping, maybe
          you could tell her we need a new
          Maytag stackable, double-decker
          washer and dryer set.

MIKE smiles, she gives him a kiss, and a flick on the
nose.

                         ELLIE
          You want to see the bedroom.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  DEN - LATER - NIGHT

The WALL CLOCK reads 9:45.  CLAIRE is working at her desk.
She gets up and moves into the hallway where she sees MIKE
through the half-opened door.  CLAIRE moves to the
doorway.

                         CLAIRE
          Hi.  Just checking to see if you're
          here.

                         MIKE
          I came on at 8:00.

An awkward silence.

                         MIKE
          You all right?

                         CLAIRE
          Yeah.

                         MIKE
          I'm sorry about what happened.

                         CLAIRE
          Listen, that was my fault.

                         MIKE
                  (disagreeing)
          I shouldn't have listened to you, I
          should've followed you right into
          the "can" the way he did.

                         CLAIRE
          If I had known I was going to have
          company, he was right next to me.  I
          think he heard me peeing!  I hate
          that, I am glad he's in jail.

She laughs, he smiles, both attempting to make light of
it.  But it's hard to make light of; the attempt quickly
fades.

                         CLAIRE
          Lieutenant Garber says when I
          identify him, they're going to lock
          him up and throw away the key.

MIKE nods; buttoning his lip.

                         CLAIRE
          I guess I'm supposed to do it in the
          morning.  Identify him.

                         MIKE
                  (uneasy)
          Sooner, the better.

                         CLAIRE
          He said he'd kill me.

                         MIKE
          Big talk... Desperate guy.

                         CLAIRE
          Right.  How could he do that if he's
          in jail and they've thrown away the
          key...?

MIKE is TORN.

                         MIKE
          It's the right thing to do.
          Identifying him.

She starts to walk away.

                         MIKE
          Claire?

                         CLAIRE
          Hmm...

                         MIKE
                  (holds up a book)
          You wouldn't happen to know what
          language they speak in India, do
          you?

                         CLAIRE
          Urdu and Hindi.

                         MIKE
                  (amazed)
          Yeah, what a woman.

He marks it in his CROSSWORDS:  she moves closer,leaning
over his shoulder to see.

                         CLAIRE
          Didn't do very well, did you?

                         MIKE
                  (a laugh)
          Nope... never finished one yet.  I
          hate these things.

                         CLAIRE
          You were reading my Renoir.

                         MIKE
          How did you know?

                         CLAIRE
          You put it back in the wrong
          place... Do you like Renoir?

                         MIKE
                  (thoughtful)
          They're kind of fuzzy.

                         CLAIRE
          You know why they're like that...?
          He was myopic... going blind.

                         MIKE
          No kidding.

In the SILENCE that follows, their eyes on each other,
appraising.

                         CLAIRE
          So, this could be your last night,
          huh?

                         MIKE
          Could be, I guess.

                         CLAIRE
                  (a thought)
          Want to go out for a drink?
                  (re: his surprised
                   expression)
          I mean, we're both sitting here, and
          Joey Venza's in jail...

                         MIKE
                  (a beat)
          Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I
          follow.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

CLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the
BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their
conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's
company.

                         CLAIRE
                  (laughing)
          You mean to tell me, a mugger would
          stay away from someone because they
          walked a certain way?

                         MIKE
          Absolutely.  Look at this.

He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in
ridiculous awkwardness.

                         CLAIRE
          That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!

                         MIKE
                  (indignant)
          No, no seriously!  There's a study
          done on this, you walk this way, the
          muggers are gonna single you out.

                         CLAIRE
          And die laughing, because you're
          walking so stupid!

                         MIKE
                  (mock anger)
          Hey.  This is my business.  Do I
          tell you your business.

                         CLAIRE
          Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger
          gets me.

She takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse
than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO.

INT.  PATROL CAR - NIGHT

The COPS following exchange dubious glances, getting a
glimpse of the strangeness.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  PIANO BAR - NIGHT

CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE and MIKE, at a small table, in
darkness, a piano bar playing in the background.  The song
being sung is "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

                         MIKE
          ... It was like... the minute I saw
          her... I knew.  She looked so damn
          adorable in a cop's uniform...
          puttin' on a big, tough act...

                         CLAIRE
          So it was "love".

                         MIKE
          Yeah.  It was.

                         CLAIRE
          And "is"...?

He hesitates; but nods.

                         MIKE
                  (confirming it)
          Yeah.

                         CLAIRE
          That's nice.  And you live in
          Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?

                         MIKE
          No dog.

                         CLAIRE
          I saw you with a dog, in my mind.

                         MIKE
          No dog.

                         CLAIRE
          But "nice".

                         MIKE
          Very nice.

Her envy is plain.

                         MIKE
          What about Neil?

                         CLAIRE
          You don't like him, do you?

                         MIKE
                  (a pause)
          What's to like?

                         CLAIRE
                  (amused)
          Tell it like it is.

                         MIKE
          You asked.

                         CLAIRE
          He's very caring, in his way.  You
          haven't seen him at his best.

                         MIKE
          You could do better.

                         CLAIRE
                  (laughs)
          I'll miss you, Mike...

ANGLE ON BOTH:  the music playing.

                         CLAIRE
          It was nice having you "watch over
          me"...

                         MIKE
          Yeah.  I liked being around you
          too... Claire.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  feeling a moment of awkwardness.

                         MIKE
          Let's go home.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

The PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS
in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are
seeing.  MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is
cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her
shoulders.

INT.  CLAIRE'S ELEVATOR - NIGHT

As they ride up in silence -- on opposite sides of the
elevator -- looking at each other.  It comes to a stop,
and neither moves; the tension is palpable.

She steps out first, he follows.  She moves to the doors
and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up
behind her.  But he stops, too.  And she turns.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  Both captive to indecision.  It is he who
makes it, just by staying immobile for too long.  She
smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him.  And
in the moment of exchange is the return to reality.

                         CLAIRE
          Good night, Mike.

                         MIKE
          Sleep good.

She turns to open the door.  Entering she -- and we --
suddenly can see Neil pacing in the hall, b.g.  He's
returned.  He looks up, worried and very upset.

CLOSE ANGLES ON FACES.

                         NEIL
          It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
          Where the hell have you been?

          Hey, Mike, tough night.

                         KOONTZ
          I guess it happens, you know?  A
          chick gives you a ride in her
          limousine, the next thing she wants
          is to wear your clothes...
                  (a beat)
          ... I heard he had her underpants on
          his head.

That one got to him; stopped dead by it, he turns, giving
KOONTZ a challenging look.

                         COP #1
          Ease up, Mike.  Ain't nobody gonna
          tell the old lady.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  cooling down -- then girding himself for
GARBER.

                         KOONTZ
          Ain't the first time the taxpayers

          Don't tell me it was "no big deal,"
          it was out of line, it makes you
          look like an asshole, and it makes
          me look like an asshole.  She's
          coming in, in a few minutes to I.D.
          Venza.  If Steinhart's with her, I
          want you to apologize.
                  (in motion)
          Let's get this over with...

In the room next to the corridor, KOONTZ interrupts the
shift already there, entering.

                         KOONTZ
          Okay, we're gonna have a line-up
          here...

The OTHER COPS grab their things and scatter, not wanting
to get involved in another cop's headache.

INT.  FARTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE approaching with NEIL, with T.J. on guard-duty.

                         GARBER
          Good morning, Miss Gregory.

MIKE AND CLAIRE catch each other's eyes.  He sees how
nervous she is.

                         CLAIRE
          It was my fault not Detective
          Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the
          fuss.

NEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with
a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last
night.

GARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially
not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE.

                         GARBER
                  (to Claire)
          You all ready?

                         NEIL
                  (playing the
                   protector role)
          Will this take long?

                         GARBER
          We'll see.

GARBER TURNS, getting them started.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

They crowd in; another MAN already standing there --
VENZA'S PARK AVENUE LAWYER.  A one-way window looks into
the brightness of the line-up (squad) room that's emptied
now and undergoing preparation by KOONTZ.

GARBER to CLAIRE, a professional reassurance.

                         GARBER
          They can't hear you, they can't see
          you...
                  (introducing pro
                   forma)
          Mr. Venza's attorney, Mr. Neuman;
          arresting officer Keegan...
                  (to Claire)
          Good luck.

With that, GARBER leads NEIL out.  NEIL manages a final
concerned stare at CLAIRE before he goes.  The DOOR
CLOSES.  MIKE, CLAIRE, and an unruffled MR. NEUMAN, THE
LAWYER, are left alone in the cramped space.


INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - SAME - DAY

KOONTZ beckons VENZA and the OTHER FOUR LINE-UP
PARTICIPANTS IN.

                         KOONTZ
          Okay, take a seat... you, put a
          couple phone books under your
          rear...

VENZA enters confidently, with the others.  He's number
three.  He takes his place, staring unconcernedly past the
bright lights toward the direction of the mirrored window,
as if he could see through it, into CLAIRE'S EYES.


INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE, staring expressionless, her eyes etched with fear.
MIKE aware of that fear.  VENZA'S LAWYER waiting
patiently, casually.


INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - DAY

VENZA and the OTHERS WAITING, now STANDING ON DISPLAY.

                         KOONTZ (V.O.) (OVER SPEAKER)
          Will everyone except number three
          please take one step back?

VENZA'S JAW TIGHTENS, a flicker, before catching himself
and controlling the reaction.  Realizing.  She's making
positive identification.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  SUBWAY - EVENING

MIKE, empty-eyed.  On his way HOME.

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE dressed for sleep, in a DISNEYWORLD T-SHIRT, pauses
to glance with worried eyes -- toward the living room
where WE HEAR the SOUND of a TV.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  on a couch, beer in hand -- mindlessly
watching.

                         ELLIE
          Coming to bed?

                         MIKE
          Few minutes.  Want to catch the
          news.

                         ELLIE
                  (hesitant)
          Should I wait up?  We've got to get
          up early for the beach tomorrow.

                         MIKE
          I'll be right up.

She accepts it, reluctantly -- returning to the BEDROOM.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  hitting the remote to SCAN the channels;
troubled.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S DEN - EVENING

CLAIRE at ease on the couch, staring, trying to follow the
images of the television.  NEIL, at the bar, pours them
both a drink.

                         NEIL
          They need me back in Miami, but I'd
          really like it if you could join me.
          The marlin fishing's supposed to be
          great off the Keys...

He steps forward with her drink.

                         NEIL
          The change would do you a world of
          good.

She straightens, suddenly attentive, in response to
something on the TV.

It's a REPORT FROM OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE, with the TV
NEWSMAN reporting:

                         TV NEWSMAN
          Denied bail, Joey Venza will remain
          behind bars at least until the time
          of the trial --

ANGLE ON NEIL, watching.

                         NEIL
          Hallelujah.

He gives her a drink, leaning down to kiss her on the
forehead.

                         NEIL
          At least now we can get on with our
          own lives.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Where life has indeed returned to normal, except for the
heavy weight of memory.  MIKE, at the counter, makes
SANDWICHES, packing a cooler for the game.  He grabs TOMMY
with an arm-hook as TOMMY tries to swipe a sandwich on the
pass through.

                         MIKE
          Hey, not yet!  How many times...

Roughhousing TOMMY, MIKE gets him squealing.  ELLIE
enters, stomping her feet clean, coming in from the
garden.

                         ELLIE
          God, it's freezin' out there.

She blows on her hands, shows MIKE how cold, putting them
against his cheeks.

                         MIKE
                  (wincing)
          Ah!

She does it to TOMMY, too, except he's too fast for her,
yelling and squirming out of the way.  The PHONE RINGS.
ELLIE doesn't answer it.  TOMMY picks it up.

                         TOMMY
                  (a beat)
          Wait a sec.

He offers the phone out to ELLIE.

                         ELLIE
          Hello.
                  (a beat)
          Yes, just a second.
                  (hands it to Mike)
          It's the Whip.

MIKE takes it.  ELLIE turns to TOMMY, who yelps and darts
away, avoiding her cold touch.

                         MIKE
                  (into phone)
          Hey Lieutenant, how are you...?
          What?!
                  (to Ellie)
          Venza's out.
                  (back to phone;
                   pissed)
          Why didn't the I.D. unit or the
          D.A.'s office know about his sheet?
                  (a beat)
          Ah shit... Yeah, yeah, okay I'm on
          my way in.

He SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE, raging.

                         ELLIE
          What?

                         MIKE
          Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi
          driver in the Bronx, thirteen months
          ago.  It's coming to court and the
          judge let him walk because of the
          pending case law.

In a fit of RAGE, he SWIPES at a MILK CARTON, sending it
HURTLING AGAINST A WALL.  ANGLE on TOMMY:  amazed.

                         ELLIE
          Mike, take it easy...

                         MIKE
          Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw
          it coming.

                         ELLIE
          It's not your fault.  Mike, please
          get off the case.

                         MIKE
                  (distraught)
          It is my fault!  I'm responsible for
          her!

                         ELLIE
          Did you hear what I said?

                         MIKE
          Did you hear what I said?!!

SILENCE.

                         MIKE
                  (to Ellie, with
                   finality)
          I'm due on at seven.

He dumps the rest of the lunch preparations in the sink,
exiting.

ANGLE on TOMMY and ELLIE looking distraught.

                         TOMMY
                  (dismally)
          We're not going to the game, are we
          Mom?

                         ELLIE
                  (pulling herself
                   together)
          Sure we are, let's go!

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING

MUSIC TURNED UP FULL.

CLAIRE spills red wine over the counter, uncorking the
bottle.  She leaves the stain, grabbing the bottle and a
wine glass, taking them with her, in emotional extremis.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

ANGLE on MIKE:  as he rounds a corner ALMOST BUMPING INTO
the JOGGER from CLAIRE'S BUILDING; MIKE hurries,
sidestepping him, HEADING toward the ENTRANCE.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE'S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra
SECURITY -- A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  SPRINTING INWARD.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and MIKE steps out, breathless,
confronting KOONTZ.  The MUSIC CONTINUES TO BLAST from
behind the closed apartment doors.

KOONTZ grabbing his stuff, massive understatement.

                         KOONTZ
          She's a little upset.  You're going
          to have to piss in a bottle.

He holds up a beer bottle; half-filled with urine.

                         KOONTZ
                  (packs it under his
                   arm)
          Sorry, I don't have any extras.
          Have a nice night.

HE WILLINGLY LEAVE, and MIKE WAITS but a split second,
before going to the doors.  They are closed.  MUSIC blares
from within.  No other response.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

Distraught, CLAIRE tries to bring herself back from the
brink, placing the wine bottle rack down after she's
poured.

                         MIKE (O.S.)
          Claire?

                         CLAIRE
                  (frightened)
          What do you want?

                         MIKE (O.S.)
          Open the door, will you?

                         CLAIRE
          I can't open it.

                         MIKE (O.S.)
          It's just me.  I want to talk to
          you.  Let me in...

The lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to
see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying.

                         CLAIRE
          You put me life in danger.

                         MIKE
          No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna
          pick him up again...

                         CLAIRE
          And then what?  I'll never be safe.
          I'll have to leave the country!  You
          can't protect me, and you can't keep
          him in jail!  And you knew that all
          the goddamn time!

Near bursting, she SLAMS THE DOOR, leaving MIKE STUNNED:
Inside, the MUSIC is TURNED UP AGAIN to THUNDEROUS
PROPORTIONS.

Clenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS
his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed
to FULLY SHUT.

HE PUSHES IT OPEN, ENTERING THE APARTMENT, CAMERA
FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her.  The MUSIC, bounding
off the high ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous.


INT.  CLAIRE'S HALL - NIGHT

                         MIKE
                  (searching for her)
          Claire...?

He moves HURRIEDLY DOWN THE HALL to her BEDROOM, entering,
without warning, to SEE HER REFLECTION in the MIRROR as
she PULLS ON SOME CLOTHES.

                         MIKE
          What are you doing?

The dress on, she SWEEPS past him, heading toward the
doors.

                         CLAIRE
          You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for
          a walk in the park.

                         MIKE
          Claire, will you calm down?

                         CLAIRE
          I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal
          human being.  I'm going for a walk
          in the park.

                         MIKE
          Claire...!

She heads out the bedroom door.

INT.  HALL - SAME - NIGHT

ANGLE ON CLAIRE:  as she heads down the hall moving fast,
he's right behind her.

                         MIKE
          Stop, will you?!

HE GRABS HER, SPINNING HER AROUND.

                         CLAIRE
                  (struggling)
          Let go!

                         MIKE
          Stop being nuts!

                         CLAIRE
                  (hysterical)
          I trusted you!  I thought you cared
          about me?!

                         MIKE
          I do care about you!

                         CLAIRE
          More bullshit!  More bullshit!
                  (struggling)
          What kind of odds are they giving
          me?  There must be some kind of
          office pool.  One month?  A couple
          of days?

Their physicality reaches a CLIMAX with MIKE pinning her
against the wall, she, restrained by him, finally GIVING
UP, with a SOB, and COLLAPSING INTO HIS ARMS.

                         MIKE
                  (handling her close)
          Easy... easy... I'm not gonna leave
          you alone like this...

ANGLE ON CLAIRE:  gasping as she clings to him.

                         MIKE
          I'm not gonna let anything happen to
          you...

He holds her; makes a tentative move toward her -- and
stops.  She CLOSES THE DISTANCE.  THEY KISS.  They
separate, making sure.  They KISS AGAIN, certain.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE startles awake, premonitorily.

ELLIE:  She turns in the darkness to look at the clock.
Heart beating, she reclines again, lying awake, realizing
what it was that woke her.  She listens, hearing it again.

A shuffling SOUND, something moving, outside.

She stirs, sitting up, listening.

ANGLE:  Only silence answers.

ELLIE gets up, dissatisfied by the silence, and moves to
the rear bedroom window.

AT THE REAR WINDOW, she looks out into the darkness.

HER POV - BACK YARD

It's almost impossible to see anything.  Nothing moves.


INT.  HALL/LANDING - NIGHT

ELLIE closes TOMMY'S door, listens again for the SOUND;
starts quietly down the stairs.


INT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

ELLIE reaches the ground floor, moving for the kitchen.


INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

ELLIE enters.  She GASPS.  A SMALL SHADOWED FIGURE TURNS,
CONFRONTING HER.  It's TOMMY, having left his room
earlier.

                         TOMMY
                  (hushed)
          There's somebody outside...

Recovering from the scare, ELLIE grabs him, relieved,
sinking to her KNEES and HOLDING HIM TIGHT.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE gets up, dressing.  CLAIRE watches from the bed.  He
returns her gaze, reluctant to go, but hesitating to touch
her again.  CLAIRE clasps his hand, bringing him closer.
They kiss, in affirmation.


INT.  VESTIBULE - NIGHT

MIKE stands by the front door as T.J. arrives to begin
his duty.

                         T.J.
          We're gonna need snow boots.

MIKE nods, absently, entering the elevator.  The PHONE
starts to RING in the apartment.

INT.  SUBWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

MIKE; miserable.  The "QUEENS" exit is SEEN APPROACHING
through the TRAIN WINDOW; he attempts to pull himself
together, rising, waiting for the train to stop.


EXT.  MIKE'S STREET - SAME

As MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.  His breath
catches.  His heart starts to pound.

AHEAD, lights ablaze.  ONE COP CAR is in front of his
HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).  MIKE BREAKS INTO
A RUN.


INT.  MIKE'S ENTRY - NIGHT - MORNING

He rushes in.  The front door is unlocked, lights are on,
but otherwise there is nothing different.  He hears
VOICES.


INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING

MIKE hurries in.  The room is bright.  SCOTTY and another
cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen
table, nursing cups of coffee.  BROOKLYN is on duty;
SCOTTY has come over on his own.

TOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed.  ELLIE
making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters.

She is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment.

                         SCOTTY
          Calm down, everything is okay.
          Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably
          one of those peepers who've been
          making this neighborhood such a
          pleasure...

SCOTTY collects his gun from the table, rising.

                         SCOTTY
          We all look like hell.

                         BROOKLYN
                  (rising)
          Well, there you are...
                  (to Ellie,
                   unconcerned)
          I'll come 'round in the car from
          time to time so you can get some
          sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled.

He gives her a peck, yawning.

                         BROOKLYN
          Thanks for the coffee.

                         ELLIE
                  (to both)
          Thanks.  You're terrific.

SCOTTY waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after
BROOKLYN.  ELLIE turns back to MIKE.

                         ELLIE
                  (sheepishly)
          I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises...
          the detective's wife...

                         MIKE
                  (tensely)
          I want you and Tommy to stay with my
          mother.

She shakes her head, amused.

                         ELLIE
          Don't be ridiculous... That's all I
          need, rubbing up against your mother
          and grandmother every day... I can
          take care of myself...
                  (gently, to him)
          C'mon, let's go to bed... we all
          need some sleep...

CLOSE ON MIKE.  Feeling like absolute hell.

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

MIKE is threading his necktie.  ELLIE stands behind him,
in the kitchen, grinning.

                         ELLIE
          C'mon, don't make an issue of it.
          Do you want the fucking meatloaf or
          not?

                         MIKE
          D'you have to say "fucking" every
          other word?

                         ELLIE
          What was that?

                         MIKE
          You heard me.

                         ELLIE
          Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding
          you a line of crap.

                         MIKE
          What're you talking about --

                         ELLIE
          I'm talking about I've been talking
          this way for sixteen years and now,
          out of the blue, it's vulgar!

She leaves the room, slamming the door behind her.  He
looks at himself in the mirror, wondering what's possessed
him.

                         MIKE
          Fuck.  What's happening?


INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - DAY

MIKE sits at the table with a cup of coffee.  He watches
ELLIE from the window.

MIKE'S POV

ELLIE:  Tight jeans, workshirt, scarf tied around her
head, she looks great.  She looks up, rinsing a greasy
grill over a bucket of hot water, playfully sprays the
window with the hose, seeing him watching her.

INT.  SUBWAY - EVENING

MIKE walking along the platform amidst the crowded car,
returning to his work and his destination.

INT.  CLAIRE'S ENTRY HALL - EVENING

A heavy silence.  MIKE sitting, on duty again.  He keeps
to himself.  He doesn't move from his chair.

CLAIRE finally enters.  She holds tensely, waiting, aware
of his mood.

                         CLAIRE
          Is everything all right?

His stare is unyielding.

                         MIKE
          Yeah.

                         CLAIRE
          They called here after you left...

                         MIKE
                  (sharply)
          She's okay.  Everything's okay...

He looks up.

                         MIKE
                  (anguished)
          I don't know you...

                         CLAIRE
          This is me, Mike.  There's nothing
          else...

                         MIKE
          You don't wash your clothes at the
          Boulevard Laundromat... you don't
          pick up your kids from some crummy
          public school... what is this?  A
          fuckin' joke?

                         CLAIRE
                  (beat; sustaining)
          Okay, then let's make it easy.  It
          was a mistake.  Don't make me feel
          guilty now that it's over, let's
          forget about it.

She walks away; MIKE sits.


INT.  CLAIRE'S STUDY

She turns to her table to resume work.  Scribbled pages
litter the surface.  Her hands betray her.  It's an effort
of will.  MIKE enters, moving closer.

Beginning to cry, she feels his embrace, turning into it.

                         CLAIRE
          Don't you think I know what this is
          doing.  I know you have a wife.  I
          know you have a family... I'm not
          asking for anything.  I don't want
          anything... Just please hold me I'm
          scared...

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

CLAIRE lies asleep.  MIKE leans over her as she wakes,
meeting his gaze, bringing him closer before he goes.
They kiss.  He withdraws, tenderly returning her gaze and
returning her to sleep.


INT.  HER HALLWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

T.J. standing in the hallway.

                         T.J.
          Mike...?

ANGLE ON T.J., as the bedroom DOOR OPENS -- REVEALING
MIKE.  T.J. recoils with surprise.

                         T.J.
          Oh, man.  I don't believe you.

MIKE steps out, closing the door behind him; distraught.

                         MIKE
                  (beat)
          All fucked up, T.J.

T.J. issues a long, saddened sigh; just staring at him.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE sits in a chair by the far wall, staring out toward
Manhattan, which glows palely, in the distance.  Now PAN
OVER THE BED where ELLIE lies asleep.  But as WE MOVE
CLOSE TO HER FACE, WE SEE she is not asleep; wide-eyed,
aware of MIKE in the chair.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

ELLIE stirs as MIKE slips between the sheets.  She
embraces him, starts to kiss him.  He rolls over.

A moment of silence.

                         ELLIE
          You gotta get another tour.  We're
          gettin' too old for this.

                         MIKE
          I'm sorry.

                         ELLIE
          I'm not saying it's your fault.

More silence.

                         MIKE
          What did you do tonight?

                         ELLIE
          I watched TV.

                         MIKE
          What did you watch?

                         ELLIE
          I don't remember Michael, go to
          sleep.  You don't have to make
          conversation with me.

She snuggles up to him.

                         ELLIE
          I'll make a reservation tomorrow for
          early dinner.  You can sleep till
          noon.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BROOKLYN RESTAURANT - EVENING

THE LIGHTS of New York beginning to sparkle against a
darkening sky; MIKE and ELLIE at a table that looks out on
the East River.  It's an OK restaurant, not the poshest in
the world.  ELLIE finds herself carrying most of the
conversation.  They scan menus to order.

                         ELLIE
          Hey, we qualify for the Senior
          Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did
          you see Tommy today?  He misses
          you...

                         MIKE
          Well.  This'll be over soon.
          Venza's such a nut job, we're bound
          to pick him up soon.

                         ELLIE
                  (carefully)
          I'd like you to switch to the day
          shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner.
          Helen insists that T.J. be home for
          dinner... That's why he's on the
          morning shift.

                         MIKE
          Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and
          all.
                  (evasive)
          I'll talk to Garber about it.

                         ELLIE
                  (girds herself)
          I already did.  I mean, I talked to
          his wife, and she talked to him...

                         MIKE
                  (stopped)
          You talked to his wife?

CLOSE ON MIKE:  incredulous.

                         MIKE
          My wife talks to his wife about what
          shift I'm gonna take?

                         ELLIE
          What's the difference?

MIKE is nonplused; not knowing how to respond.

                         ELLIE
          Unless there's some particular
          reason why it feels better to be
          around her at night.

He shakes his head, dismissively.

                         ELLIE
          Is there, Mike?

No response; MIKE having trouble with it.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  sensing deception.  Her eyes begin to
glisten.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  seeing her distress.  Unable to hide his
own.

She looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does,
is certain.  She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an
attempt not to cry.

                         ELLIE
          What, what is it?  Is it serious or
          what...?  Quit looking at me like
          that!  What's with this ridiculous
          silence?!

Her eyes flush with tears.

                         ELLIE
          Goddamn.  I never thought this
          would happen to me... you fuckin'
          sonofabitch...

She UPSETS her SETTING, GETTING UP from the TABLE, shaking
him off.

                         ELLIE
          I just want you off the case.  Get
          off it, or don't come home.
                  (her voice trembling)
          And I want you to remember... when
          we're old... that when this awful
          thing happened... I behaved like a
          lady.
                  (embittered)
          The kind of "lady" you apparently
          prefer.

                         WAITER
                  (approaching)
          We got some specials.

She BOLTS from the room; MIKE following her.

                         MIKE
                  (to the waiter)
          We'll be right back.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

She weaves toward the car.  MIKE goes after her.

                         MIKE
          Let me drive...

                         ELLIE
          Get away from me... get away!  She
          means that much to you, you stay
          with her.  But you come back, you
          come back for me.  Not for Tommy,
          not for your mother, or your fucking
          job, but for me.

                         MIKE
                  (tortured)
          El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.
                  (with difficulty)
          And you are a lady.  I have so much
          respect...

She TURNS and SWINGS AT HIM, catching him SQUARE IN THE
NOSE; he's stunned and bleeding.

                         ELLIE
                  (through her tears;
                   screaming)
          You fucker!  Don't tell me how much
          respect you have!  You dumb mother
          fucking FUCKER!  Now get off this
          case or don't come home!!

She RUNS to her car, BURNING RUBBER as she PEELS out of
the PARKING LOT -- leaving MIKE, distraught, gazing after
her.

EXT.  PHONE BOOTH - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - EVENING

TRAFFIC ROARING BY -- revealing MIKE, upset, on a pay
phone, a finger in one ear, waiting for the phone to
answer.

                         MIKE
          Hey, T.J.?  Yeah, listen, I need a
          huge favor from you, man.  I know
          Helen doesn't like you to miss
          dinner, but I need you to switch
          shifts with me tonight.
                  (a beat)
          Just "personal".  I don't know what
          the hell I'm doin', I need some time
          to think.
                  (angered)
          Look, do it or don't do it, but
          spare me the fuckin' lecture, all
          right?

He HANGS UP:  miserable.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - EVENING

A SQUAD CAR parked in front, CAMERA PANNING to the DOORS,
as the JOGGER (MR. SPARKS) EXITS, dressed in his usual
outfit, POUNDING DETERMINEDLY across the street.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  as he LOPES INTO THE PARK.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING that's
"RED"; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into
the park.  A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing
to a stop behind him, its back door slowly swinging open,
engulfing our sight of him...

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - LATER

The "JOGGER" returning, obscuring his identity from the
parked PATROL CAR, by wiping his face with a towel.
Before heading to the door, where a DOORMAN stands guard,
he delays as though WAITING FOR SOMETHING.

It's happening:  A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL,
distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his
attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for
the "JOGGER" to SLIP BY, making it inside.

                         DOORMAN
          I know sweetheart... we have enough
          flowers here.

ANGLE:  VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting.

                         DOORMAN
          No, no, sweetheart... not here...
          get going... Okay.

ANGLE: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the JOGGER
slip by and her mission accomplished.

                         VIETNAMESE GIRL
                  (sweetly, to Doorman)
          Have a nice day.

THE GIRL:  slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as she
skips off.

INT.  BUILDING LOBBY - SAME

The "JOGGER," his face still obscured by the towel waits
for the elevator, as T.J., arriving, ENTERS the building.
They both enter the elevator in silence.

ANGLE on T.J. glancing at the JOGGER quizzically.  The
JOGGER avoids his stare, CAMERA TILTING UP to the
indicator, beginning to rise.

INT.  SPARKS' APARTMENT - SAME

As the killer closes the door.  He's in the kitchen.  All
is quiet in there.

IN CLOSEUPS, WE SEE his JOGGING SHIRT coming off,
revealing a shoulder holster; a specially designed "belt"
removed and laid on the kitchen table.  A "SILENCER"
within.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING

CLAIRE eagerly and earnestly preparing dinner.  She makes
some fluffs, not really used to this.  CLASSICAL MUSIC
plays.  She looks up expectantly, hearing the FOOTSTEPS.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  surprised to see it's T.J.

                         T.J.
          Detective Keegan is... Mike...
          "Michael" asked me to tell you he's
          under the weather.

CLAIRE:  She handles it, crestfallen.

                         T.J.
          He'll probably take the morning
          shift.

                         CLAIRE
          He's okay?

T.J. spots, over his shoulder, the table, set for two.

                         T.J.
          Yeah, just... bad gut.  Y'know.

                         CLAIRE
          Oh.

Nothing left to say; she hides her disappointment with a
nod.

EXT.  CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

Active with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure
walking in the night.  It's MIKE; his collar turned up
against the cold, his face grim and pensive.  He passes an
art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on
his own reflection staring back at him.

CLAIRE immobile, on a window seat in her LIVING ROOM, the
CLASSICAL MUSIC still playing softly in the background,
her eyes empty as she gazes out into the park.

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Outside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a
CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation.

VENZA:  He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at
the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment.

ANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:  SILHOUETTED in the distant window.

VENZA:  finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting
into HIS CAR curbside and driving away.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - NIGHT

T.J., DOZING as the ELEVATOR INDICATOR HEADS UPWARD --
finally reaching our FLOOR.

The DOORS OPEN, STARTLING T.J.  He stares at MIKE with
DISMAY.  MUSIC IS HEARD from just inside.

                         T.J.
                  (fatigued)
          Tell me I'm dreamin'.

                         MIKE
          I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

MIKE ENTERS, closing the doors behind him.


INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

Silent, save for CLASSICAL MUSIC -- as MIKE quietly
enters.

He pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then
MOVES in the direction of the MUSIC -- SPOTTING CLAIRE,
immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the
window.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  as always, AFFECTED BY HER.

She becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS.  For a
long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak.
Finally, he does.

                         MIKE
          T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He
          knows about us.

She absorbs it, without response.

                         MIKE
                  (a beat; with
                   difficulty)
          So does Ellie.

She nods.  Thoughtfully.  As though willing to deal with
it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her
emotions.

                         CLAIRE
          You told her?

                         MIKE
          Not exactly.

                         CLAIRE
          What do you want to do?

                         MIKE
          I don't know.

Her eyes turn to his.  She moves toward him and sits.
CLAIRE pulls him close to her.  A soft GERSHWIN TUNE
plays.  She sees how drawn MIKE is.

                         CLAIRE
          You're tired.
                  (smiles, gently)
          Let me watch over you tonight...

INT.  SPARKS' APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

The MERV GRIFFIN SHOW playing on the TV; it ends, a VOICE
OVER indicating to "stay tuned for the news".  It is
SILENCED by remote control -- we HEAR FOOTSTEPS moving
away.

ANGLE INSIDE THE KITCHEN:  CLOSE on the murderous
paraphernalia left on the kitchen table, being assembled
by the "JOGGER".

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

The apartment pin-quiet and darkened.  T.J. in his chair
-- head arched back; snoring; his self-help book abandoned
on the floor.

INT.  SPARKS' VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

SPARKS' FRONT DOOR quietly "CLICKING" SHUT as the KILLER
EXITS.

CLOSER ANGLE:  THE BUTTON of the ELEVATOR being PUSHED by
a GLOVED HAND.  It activates a "HUM."

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

LONG ANGLE down the HALL, on the CLOSED DOOR TO THE
BEDROOM SUITE.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

As the ELEVATOR slides to a stop, its DOOR GLIDING OPEN.
THE KILLER, keeping himself flattened back out of sight,
glances quickly out, gun and reflexes at the ready.

It's unnecessary.  The vestibule's deserted; T.J.'S post
is momentarily empty.

The KILLER steps silently, EASING out the elevator.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

INT.  CLAIRE'S HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT

The KILLER pauses, hearing the TOILET FLUSH, retreats the
other way.

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

As T.J. emerges from the bathroom.  He stretches, trying
to shake his fatigue.  Making a decision, he HEADS for the
KITCHEN to get a cup of coffee -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM as
he ENTERS, snapping on the light.

MOVING directly to the stove, he examines the Mr. Coffee;
the red "ON" button glows, but the pot is virtually empty.

Picking it up, he MOVES TO THE SINK, turning on the tap,
which is a thin, gooseneck spigot.  He look up, hearing a
slight SHUFFLE, seeing the KILLER'S FEET sticking out of
the shadows of the floor of the LAUNDRY ROOM.

T.J. reacts -- TOO LATE -- there's a slight chung, and a
hole opens up in T.J.'S gut; the bullet that went through
him, ricocheting and nicking off the end of the thin,
curving tap, sending a stream of water gushing straight
up.

The KILLER moves quickly, catching T.J.'S body, trying to
break its fall as it hits the floor.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE asleep in MIKE'S PROTECTIVE EMBRACE:  MIKE, awake,
his eyes to the bedside table, notices the almost
imperceptible disturbance of VIBRATION ripple the surface
of the DRINK left there by the clock.

MIKE sits up; as if by instinct, sensing something is
wrong.  CLAIRE continues to sleep.


INT.  CLAIRE'S HALLWAY/OUTER BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT

The KILLER OPENS THE BEDROOM SUITE DOOR, steps into the
ANTEROOM.  Off to the right is the closed DOOR of the
BEDROOM.  He steps in the direction, reaching the doorknob
-- thinks twice about it, though, seeing the door on the
other side of the anteroom which would take him the
longer, but unexpected route into the bedroom.  He backs
off, moving silently to the OTHER DOOR, turning it open
silently and slipping through into the CLOSET and WALK-
THROUGH DRESSING ROOM leading to the bedroom by the far
side.


INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE:  on the other side of the door, listening.

He opens the door quietly, sees the anteroom door ajar,
remembering that he had closed it before.  He tightens,
closing the door and moving back to his gun in its holster
draped over the chair with his other clothes.


INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER enters the reflective maze.


INT.  MASTER BATH - NIGHT

MIKE moves silently, backtracking through the bedroom and
bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room
ahead.


INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just
another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED
ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA.

On the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening
his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for
it.  MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door
silently.  But the latch connects to the light, and the
LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE.

The KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn.  But he
faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and
MIKE IS BEHIND HIM.

MIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM.

                         MIKE
          Put it down!
                  (beat)
          Think about it!

The KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING.  MIKE FIRES FIRST,
NAILING HIM right through the HEAD.  The KILLER SPINS
AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to
the floor.

IN THE BEDROOM:  CLAIRE wakes.

MIKE:  checking quickly on the dead assassin, flattens
himself against the wall and scurries back through the
bath the way back into the BEDROOM.

                         MIKE
                  (entering, to Claire)
          Get on the floor!  There may be
          more!

CLAIRE does what he says.

MIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR, hugging the wall; he PAUSES
momentarily, then RACES down the HALL.

ANGLE ON THE OPENED FRONT DOOR as he REACHES IT, seeing
T.J.'S CHAIR empty.

                         MIKE
                  (desperate)
          T.J.!

MIKE RUNS, frantically, into the living room, the
bathroom, the den -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM into the
KITCHEN.

CLOSE ON HIS FACE:  twisting with GRIEF.

ANGLE ON T.J. face down in a pool of blood, MIKE RACING
TO HIM, rolling him over.

                         MIKE
                  (sobs)
          T.J...!

MIKE moves by REFLEX, starting mouth-to-mouth.  But there
is blood everywhere.

MIKE desperate; pumping T.J.'S chest.

                         MIKE
          Live, T.J.  Please...!

CLAIRE appears behind him, to help.

                         MIKE
                  (to her)
          Get security on the phone!
          Emergency!

She RUNS to the KITCHEN PHONE; it's dead, the WIRES CUT.

She TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR,
pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse.  The ALARM goes
off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  shirtless and shoeless, on his knees in
T.J.'S blood, desperately pumping his chest.

                         MIKE
                  (his voice cracking)
          Ambulance!  Ambulance!  He's got a
          heartbeat...!

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NEAR DAWN

MIKE alone on a bench, his head in his hands:  a couple of
COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away,
at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him.
It is not yet dawn.

FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see
GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the
occasion.  GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look,
MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish.

                         MIKE
                  (softly)
          They're operating on him.  He's
          still alive.

                         GARBER
                  (grim)
          I heard.

A long pause, as he looks at MIKE.

                         GARBER
          I heard a lot... Anything you want
          to deny, Mike?

                         MIKE
                  (almost inaudibly)
          It should've been me...

GARBER:  aware of his own dilemma.

                         GARBER
          Then it would've been her, too.
                  (beat)
          I don't know... but I gotta protect
          the Precinct, too.  You're on
          suspension, pending Disciplinary
          Hearings.  Don't hold your breath.
          And you're not to go near that woman
          until she's no longer under Police
          protection and this case is closed.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  responding with a silent nod as GARBER
stands looking down at him.

                         GARBER
          Is it "love," Mike?  I hope so.  I
          want it to be worth it, for your
          sake.

No response.

In the response that follows, they HEAR MOVEMENT at the
end of the HALL, looking up to see the silhouetted figures
of ELLIE, with HELEN GREENING in tow.  They look small,
and lost, framed against a floor-to-ceiling window that's
beginning to illuminate with the first light of day.

Heavy with sadness, GARBER turns and heads toward the
women.  Taking a long moment.  MIKE decides not to follow.

CLOSE ON MIKE

CAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes
together.  We do not hear their words, but sense the
emotion by what WE SEE.  After a brief exchange of words,
GARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm, and they MOVE
AWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone.

CLOSER ANGLE:  MIKE and ELLIE, gazing at each other across
the gulf of their collective misery.

                         ELLIE
          I'm going to visit my sister for a
          few days.  I'd like you to get your
          stuff out.

                         MIKE
          What about Tommy?

                         ELLIE
          He'll live through it.  They all
          live through it.
                  (bitter)
          What a world, huh?

Nothing left to say; after a long, last look, she turns to
go.  But stops.

                         ELLIE
          Was it Venza?  Did you get him?

                         MIKE
          No.

The last thing she's going to do is cry.

                         ELLIE
                  (her voice giving
                   out)
          What a shame.

She TURNS and LEAVES:  MIKE gazing after her.

MIKE is being shown in by SCOTTY, luggage in hand, SCOTTY
doing his best to be a good "host," under trying
circumstances.

                         SCOTTY
          You see a couple of the parties that
          go on at this place, you'll realize
          that marriage is an institution
          whose time has come and gone.

Opening a bedroom door.  They've entered a bedroom that's
sparse, but decorated with A BOY'S PARAPHERNALIA;
skateboard, "rock" posters, etc.  It looks sad and barren.

                         SCOTTY
          Little Scotty stays on Wednesdays,
          and every other weekend.  And know
          what?  Our relationship's never been
          better.

MIKE stares at the room, his heart too heavy to respond.
SCOTTY, with a pat on the back.

                         SCOTTY
          Make it home, Mike...

He leaves -- and after a long moment MIKE sits on the edge
of the bed, like an automaton.  Staring.

CLAIRE and NEIL in the aftermath.  CLAIRE remains silent,
staring.  Whatever is to be said is his.

                  (frustrated)
          I'm no saint, Claire, but I do love
          you.  I can understand the pressure
          of the circumstances... but what
          about when it's over?  Are you going
          to feel the same way about him?  Is
          he going to move in here and do
          shift work at the 21st if they'll
          have him back.  Think this through
          Claire.
                  (with feeling)
          This is the rest of your life we're
          talking about.

NEIL staring at her.

                         CLAIRE
          I have thought it through, Neil.

He adverts his gaze, turns, controlling himself, and picks
up his coat to go.

                         NEIL
          Call me if anything changes.  I love
          you, Claire.

EXT.  QUEENS - SAME - DAY

CAMERA PANNING TO REVEAL MIKE, leaning on a CAR, under the
"El" waiting.  HE SPOTS TOMMY, coming around the corner
with his SKATEBOARD under his arm, going into a grocery
store.  MIKE crosses the street as TOMMY comes out of the
store.

                         MIKE
          Tommy!

TOMMY SPOTS HIM:  hesitant -- slowly approaching the car.

                         MIKE
          How are things going, pal?

                         TOMMY

          What!  What kind of pathetic line is
          that?

                         TOMMY
                  (pointing)
          We're gonna pass the street.

MIKE stops.  His goat is gotten.

                         TOMMY
          You coming in?

                         MIKE
          No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd
          rather go to a "singing lesson" than
          have dinner with your father...

                         TOMMY
          We're not going to a singing lesson,
          she's just gonna start taking
          singing lessons.

                         MIKE
          So, what are you doing tonight?

                         TOMMY
          Shooting.

                         MIKE
          Shooting?

                         TOMMY
          Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to
          being alone in this neighborhood.
                  (a long beat;
                   observing his
                   father)
          'Bye, Dad.

TOMMY starts toward the HOUSE.  He's emotional, but
doesn't know how to express it.

                         MIKE
          Tommy!
                  (a parting shot)
          The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't
          sing.

                         TOMMY
                  (turning back,
                   smiling)
          I don't think she can sing, either.

                         MIKE
          Take care, pal.

HE TURNS AWAY.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  MIKE'S CAR LEAVING.  TOMMY watches it
until it can be seen no longer, then TURNS, going into the
house.

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY -- REVEALING, far down the BLOCK, a
CAR.  VENZA, and ANOTHER MAN (SOSA), are within:
WATCHING.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

MIKE pounds it out running on the darkened street.  He
pauses to look up at his dark, empty house as a PATROL CAR
slows to check him out.  He studies them as they pass.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  he gazes after them, then continues to
jog.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  FIRING RANGE - SAME - NIGHT

GUN BLASTS going off in OUR EARS, CAMERA PANNING A LINE of
COPS putting in their PRACTICE HOURS; ENDING ON ELLIE, her
EAR BLOCKERS on, FIRING AWAY.

CLOSE ON TOMMY watching from a booth behind her.

ANGLE ON HER TARGET.  Its balls blasted off.

She comes out.

                         TOMMY
          Aren't you supposed to aim at the
          head?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CAR - NIGHT

ELLIE in the driver's seat, TOMMY in the back seat.

                         TOMMY
                  (thoughtful)
          Mom, what's going to happen with you
          and Dad?

                         ELLIE
          I don't know Tommy.

A LONG BEAT as TOMMY thinks about this.  His attention
switches to a passing McDONALD'S.

                         TOMMY
          Hey, can we go to McDonald's?

                         ELLIE
          Absolutely.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING

Overhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised
of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes.
Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and
candlelight.

Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the
sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables
set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their
places engaged in animated chatter.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd,
PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible
(KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd.

SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS),
who APPROACHES, surprised to see her.

                         GIDDINGS
          Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary
          that you came.

                         CLAIRE
          It was something my father always
          liked me to do.

                         GIDDINGS
                  (apprehensive)
          You're planning to speak?

                         CLAIRE
          Not if you don't want me to.

                         GIDDINGS
                  (a brief hesitation)
          Well, of course, we'd be...
          honored...

                         CLAIRE
                  (understands; gamely)
          Just putting in an appearance then.

SHE GLANCES around, her "ESCORTS" mistaking it for
anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round
dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her
in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes
continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and
fearing.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow
dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE,
sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated
table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin
is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine
glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her
dispassionately.

CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains
animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a
segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the
bandstand indicating that the change of music was his
doing.

HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful,
GRIN.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD.

                         KOONTZ
                  (as he passes)
          Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but
          you're out of your mind.

Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other.

                         CLAIRE
                  (overwhelmed)
          What a memory.

                         MIKE
          Do you dance?

                         CLAIRE
          Do you?

                         MIKE
          Pretty bad.

                         CLAIRE
          Let's do it.

They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She
puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at
him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who
knows it might be for the last time.

                         MIKE
          They guys treatin' you all right?

                         CLAIRE
                  (too emotional to
                   really talk)
          Yeah.

                         MIKE
          I've been doing a lot of thinking.

                         CLAIRE
                  (a pause)
          I know.

CLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes.

                         MIKE
          It wouldn't work.

                         CLAIRE
          I know.

The conversation is deeply caring; the tone opposite to
the words.

                         MIKE
          I'd miss my life...

                         CLAIRE
          ... Don't explain.

She rests her head on his shoulders again; they continue
to dance.

                         MIKE
          How long you going away for?

                         CLAIRE
          Long enough.

                         MIKE
          "For"...?

                         CLAIRE
          "To"... Forget about you.

CLOSE ON HER:  awash in the nearness of him.

                         CLAIRE
          I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.

                         MIKE
                  (choked up)
          Yeah...

He holds her tight -- his eyes EMOTIONAL as they roam the
room --

But HIS EXPRESSION CHANGES as he SPOTS SOMETHING at a far
end of the room.  Near the rear doors.

It's a PLAINCLOTHESMEN, headed purposefully toward KOONTZ,
conferring with him -- both men looking to MIKE, a sense
of bewilderment in their eyes.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  Stopping -- as KOONTZ heads quickly
toward.

                         KOONTZ
          Brook's patching a call through to
          you.  He thought he'd find you here.
          It sounds urgent.

MIKE:  Baffled.

                         KOONTZ
          He says it's your son.

Exchanging a quick LOOK with CLAIRE, MIKE heads for the
DOORS; she pauses, heading after.

                                            CUT TO:

OUTER LOBBY - SAME

as MIKE BARRELS through doors.

                         KOONTZ
                  (pointing)
          The office down the hall.

MIKE BREAKS INTO A RUN.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  OFFICE - SAME

as MIKE RACES IN; A PLAINCLOTHESMAN hands him the phone.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #2
          He's crying.

                         MIKE
                  (grabbing the phone)
          Tommy?  What...?
                  (frightened)
          What?!  Hello?
                  (listening; stunned)
          Who is this?
                  (trying to be calm)
          Yeah.  I'm listening.
                  (quick)
          No.  Nobody but me.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME MOMENT

CLOSE ON the RECEIVER of the PHONE:  as JOEY VENZA'S mouth
SPEAKS into it --

The images of ELLIE and TOMMY SEEN, dimly lit, in the
background, petrified; GUARDED by a SECOND MAN (SOSA)
whose figure is shrouded in darkness.

                         VENZA
          I'm glad you're where I expected you
          to be, Detective Keegan, 'cause
          you're got two minutes to get home
          or I take your family out.

                                            CUT TO:

MIKE - SAME

caught in a nightmare.

                         MIKE
                  (desperate)
          I heard you.  I'll do it.  Just
          don't touch them.
                  (a beat)
          I...
                  (a pause)
          Lemme talk to my son.
                  (suddenly)
          Hello?

It goes dead.  MIKE PARALYZED with FEAR.  CLAIRE is
ENTERING, PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 close to her heels, MIKE'S
breath coming in SHUDDERS as he stares helplessly at her
-- then turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMAN and KOONTZ.

                         MIKE
                  (stunned)
          They got my family.
                  (to Koontz)
          I need you guys.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
          Who...

                         MIKE
          Venza.

OTHER PLAINCLOTHESMEN are COMING.

                         MIKE
          At my house...!

                         KOONTZ
                  (shouting to others)
          Call a cruiser!

                         CLAIRE
          ... Mike.

                         MIKE
                  (to Claire)
          It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for
          Ellie and Tommy.

                         KOONTZ
                  (to Claire)
          Let's go.
                  (to others; urgent)
          We're takin' her home!
                  (swinging into
                   crisis mode)
          Move it!  Get the cars!

                         MIKE
                  (pleading)
          Koontz!  I need you guys!

                         KOONTZ
          We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the
          locals.
                  (re: another cops's
                   radio)
          Throw it!

                         MIKE
                  (pleading)
          No, I need'm now!

                         CLAIRE
                  (to Koontz)
          Go with him!

                         KOONTZ
          My job is to protect you!
                  (into radio)
          This is Koontz --

                         MIKE
                  (near hysteria)
          No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it
          up!  He told me not to tell anybody,
          to bring Claire and come alone!  He
          won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes
          away!  Koontz, please!

                         KOONTZ
          I can't do it, you know that... He's
          not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No
          way is he gonna let anybody walk out
          of that house alive, who can finger
          him.

MIKE WHIRLS, heedlessly, running for the DOORS, CLAIRE
RACING AFTER HIM.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
                  (calling after her)
          Hey...!

                         CLAIRE
          Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make
          them come with you!

                         MIKE
          They can't, they're assigned to
          you!  I'd do the same thing!

He RACES OUT THE DOOR:  she in PURSUIT.

                         KOONTZ
                  (re: Claire)
          Go get her.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 hurries out.

                         KOONTZ
                  (reconsidering)
          Fuck it, man.  Our brother needs us.
          Let's go.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MILTON GREGORY SCHOOL - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

MIKE BOUNDING to his car, CLAIRE hot on his heels.  She
JUMPS into the PASSENGER SEAT, pounding the DOOR LOCK
SHUT.

                         MIKE
                  (into his car)
          Go!  Get outta here!

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 REACHES HER, pulling on the DOOR.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
          Hey!

                         MIKE
          Get OUT!

                         CLAIRE
          They're assigned to me, they'll have
          to go if I come with you!

MIKE HESITATES.

                         CLAIRE
                  (screaming)
          I'm not getting out!  GO!

MIKE hits the ACCELERATOR -- PEELING OUT, leaving
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 stranded on the curb.

                         KOONTZ
                  (calling to him,
                   emerging)
          Adams...!  C'mon, move it!

ANGLE ON COPS:  RACING FOR THEIR CARS -- SCREECHING OUT.

EXT.  STREETS OF QUEENS - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE'S CAR tearing down the STREET -- PURSUED by TWO MORE
SQUAD CARS, one of them not knowing better, GIVING VOICE
TO HIS SIREN!

INT.  MIKE'S CAR - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE'S terrified eyes glancing into the REARVIEW MIRROR.

                         MIKE
          Turn off the siren...!

Luckily, THEY DO.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  wide-eyed.  In silence.

                         MIKE
                  (breathless)
          We get there, you get down, stay out
          of sight.  Don't get near that
          house.  Understand me?  Venza's not
          to know you're there!

She NODS:  terrified.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT

As MIKE'S CAR COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT, MIKE RUNNING OUT
as CLAIRE DUCKS DOWN.  The house is COMPLETELY DARKENED,
blending in with the night; the PURSUIT CARS CONVERGE as
MIKE makes it to the DOOR, his HANDS TREMBLING as he
FUMBLES with his KEYS... takes a deep breath... and
ENTERS.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT

Darkened and pin-drop silent.  They only thing that can be
heard is the SOUND of CAR DOORS slamming outside, as COPS
run into combat positions.

                         MIKE
          Tommy?  Ellie...?

The SOUND of a MUFFLED WHIMPER comes from the kitchen; he
HEADS TOWARD down a narrow HALLWAY.  He falters, ALMOST
STEPPING on a SKATEBOARD.

                         MIKE
                  (calling out)
          I'm not armed!  I'm the only one in
          here!  I can help you get away if
          you listen to what I say!

He's used to the SOUND OF HIS VOICE to mask the slight
"roll" of the SKATEBOARD under his foot:  He's sliding it
into the middle of the doorway.

                         MIKE
          I'm comin' in the kitchen!  If you
          fuckin' shoot me, they'll come in
          here, and we're all dead!  You hear
          me, Venza?!

No answer -- MIKE continues on, girding himself as he
steps into the KITCHEN DOORWAY.  He tries the light-
switch; it doesn't work.  And then a VOICE SPEAKS.  Its
breath, like his, is labored; the VOICE CRACKLING with
tension.

                         VENZA
          You made a terrible mistake, Keegan.
          You didn't do what I said.

                         MIKE
                  (his voice shaking)
          That's right, you're gonna do what I
          say.
                  (desperate)
          Joey.  I want to help you out of
          this.

                         VENZA
          You should'a brought the girl.

                         MIKE
          I brought the girl.  She's outside.

He MOVES to the WINDOW; it's right BESIDE THE TABLE.
VENZA TENSING.

                         VENZA
          Hold it...!

                         MIKE
          I'll prove it!

He LIFTS THE WINDOW, CALLING OUT:

                         MIKE
          Claire!

                         CLAIRE (V.O.)
          Mike...?

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

CLAIRE, having shouted from behind a COP CAR:  KOONTZ
grabbing hold of her to keep her in place.

                         KOONTZ
                  (a hiss of warning)
          Not another word until I tell you.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

VENZA; wary.

                         VENZA
          How do I know that's her?

                         MIKE
          I'll bring her in.  You let them go,
          and I'll bring her in.

                         VENZA
                  (wary)
          Why should she come in?

                         MIKE
          She trusts me.  She'll do what I
          say.

                         VENZA
          Bullshit!  Prove it.

                         MIKE
                  (calls out the
                   window)
          Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire!
          It's pitch dark in here!
                  (his words are
                   carefully chosen)
          You're gonna have trouble seeing
          anything, so just come in, and
          straight down a long hall.  Then
          stand at the door so we can see you.
          We want to see your face and we
          won't be able to until you get to
          the kitchen door!

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT

KOONTZ receiving his "message".  Quickly assessing CLAIRE,
he looks to the COPS around him -- then GRITS HIS TEETH
with DECISION.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT

                         MIKE
          I want your guarantee they'll be
          turned loose when she opens the
          front door.

                         VENZA
          I get my hostage first.  No one's
          turned loose until I say so.

                         MIKE
          Let my kid go.

                         VENZA
          I'm not lettin' no one go.

                         MIKE
          Get that gun away from his head, or
          I'll keep her from coming in!  Put
          the gun on me, he can't hurt you!
          He's tied up!  Put him under the
          table!

                         VENZA
          Don't you fuckin' give orders to
          me...

                         MIKE
          Put him under the table or I'll stop
          her from coming in.

MIKE turns to the window, about to shout.

                         VENZA
                  (to Tommy, an order)
          Under the table.

                         MIKE
          I'll take his place, all right?  Put
          the gun to my head.

MIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE
CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE
"beneath the table".

CLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his
back; emitting a whimper of terror.

                         ELLIE
          Be careful, Tommy.

HE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for
safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD.

The FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF
CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from
outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway.

                         MIKE
                  (frantic)
          Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your
          step.  Come slowly.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied
behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his
head.  It's impossible.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE
slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND
lowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under
the TABLE.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands
managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely
attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue
to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL.

ANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about
to STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

                         MIKE
          Watch your step!

                         VENZA
                  (rising)
          What the fuck you doin'?!

TOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN.

                         MIKE
          There's a skateboard in the door!

With a sudden SOUND of TAPE "RIPPING" from under the
TABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE
GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE
SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS
ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in
RETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR,
rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS
"PINGING" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE.
The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES
like the Fourth of July, mixed with the "WHINE" of bullets
hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling
through the dark.

The "FIGURE AT THE DOOR" is firing with both hands,
SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down,
wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for
it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two
hands tied in front of her.

                         ELLIE
                  (to Tommy)
          Stay down!

The ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her
feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching
him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing
BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA,
trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...

                         MIKE
          Turn around, fuck!

He DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the "FIGURE" in the door,
SIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has
life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS
from the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by
CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down.

And then all is quiet.

INSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly
ceased; everyone is a state of shock.

                         ELLIE
                  (desperate)
          Tommy...!

                         TOMMY
          I'm all right.

                         MIKE
          Ellie...

                         ELLIE
          I'm all right.

The overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the "FIGURE" in the
doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS.
Guns in both hands, still smoking.

                         KOONTZ
                  (emphatic)
          Fuckin' miracle, man.

In the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward.
The SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE,
TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place.
Listening to them come.

                         KOONTZ
                  (re: the sirens)
          Told you they'd be here in a few
          minutes.

The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picks
up VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through
the ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS
TOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face
from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the
floor.

OTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in
an OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and
frightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all
are safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence of
something else in her eyes.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his family
wrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meeting
her eyes.

                         CLAIRE
          Everyone's all right...?

                         MIKE
          Yeah.  It's all over.

LONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the single
light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people
begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary
details, in the aftermath of the crisis.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME

The LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their
revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small
gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,
AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.

CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in
the distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in the
police overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, but
separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.

CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say.

                         MIKE
          So.

                         CLAIRE
          So.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's.

                         MIKE
          You still going away?

                         CLAIRE
          I don't know...

                         MIKE
          You don't have to, now.

                         CLAIRE
          I think it's probably still a good
          idea.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message.

                         MIKE
          Yeah...

Both are hurting.

                         CLAIRE
                  (heartfelt)
          I'll miss you, Mike.

                         MIKE
          Listen, I'll... see you again.

Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.
But he can't quiet manage it.

                         CLAIRE
                  (barely able to
                   speak)
          Say goodbye.

He struggles with it; unable.

                         MIKE
          I like your coat.

                         CLAIRE
                  (half-laugh, half-cry)
          You have a weakness for Lady Cops.

                         MIKE
          I do.

Silence now; their eyes adoring.

                         CLAIRE
          Say goodbye, Mike.

                         MIKE
                  (thick voiced)
          You take care.

MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY
AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.
They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative
greeting.

                         MIKE
                  (finally)
          What do you think?
                  (a beat)
          Any chance?  There's nothin' else
          I'm any good at, but this.

                         GARBER
                  (noncommittal)
          Call me next week.  We'll talk about
          it.

MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside
a SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADS
TOWARD.

ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands
beside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out and
tousles TOMMY'S hair.

                         MIKE
          Good police work, kiddo.

He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.

                         ELLIE
                  (re: Tommy)
          He doesn't want to sleep here.
                  (a long beat)
          Neither do I.  It's not my house
          anymore.

                         MIKE
          Me neither.

ANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes.

                         MIKE
          Let's find some place to start over.

MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A
LONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN
FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.  WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped
into a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS
AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL
DIRECTIONS.

From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.

                         MIKE (V.O.)
                  (to Ellie)
          What this crap about singing
          lessons?

                                            FADE OUT.

                         THE END
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE

                                                            1.








OVER BLACK

We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"...







EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER

MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.
A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get
in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly" let inside.
SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking
a beer out of the bottle.

                       HARRY (V.O.)

             Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
             satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That
             fleeting age when everything just falls
             right into place. It's magic time and it
             can render any man, anywhere --
             absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an
             expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's
             'cause I've been dating them for over
             forty years...







INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER

What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his
arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:







A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN

The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.

                        HARRY

                 (to Hostess)
             Langer. ..
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.

                       MAITRE'D

             Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other
Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.

                       HARRY (V.O.)

             So what does a life of bucking the system
             all add up to?




                                                         2.











                    HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          To never settle down with the right woman
          for a life of leftovers and Christmas
          mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no
          mini van parked in the garage. I think
          it's made me what I am today.
              (Harry smiles to someone
               across the room)
          The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.
          Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I
          should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my
          life would be like if I was a Regular Joe
          and came in here once a month with a dame
          my age' for a porterhouse and a side of
I         spinach. I've wondered...







 NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION

Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With
him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

IN HER FIFTIES.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
          really my age. . .







INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO

Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          There you have it. The story in a
          nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
              (Harry TRIPS, his wife
               looks disgusted)
          Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at
          me. I look like I'm about to die. God
          help me. I do not want to die.

                                            SMASH CUT TO:





                                                         3.














A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY

A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next
to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS
along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.

                    MARIN

              ( singing)
          To all my thugs that be livin' it
          up, we say, what I do. To all my...
              (stops)
          Oh! This is it. Make a right.

                    HARRY

              (admiring the
               neighborhood)
          So baby, you're rich... .

                    MARIN

          Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
          really...

                    HARRY

          If she lives within a mile of here, she's
          rich.

                    MARIN

          I guess a hit play will buy you a house
          in The Hamptons.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to meet your mother.

                    MARIN

          No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
          great. She's totally brilliant, but
          she's not your type.

                    HARRY

          You're overlooking one of the great
          things about me. I don't have a type.

                    MARIN

              (very directly)
          She's over thirty.
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.

                    MARIN

          Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
          have a slight reputation for...




                                                         4.










Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.

                    HARRY

          -- For what?
Harry waits. RINGGG!
He doesn't look away.

                    MARIN

          For never dating anyone over 30.
          Don't look at me like that.

                    HARRY

          It's just not true.

                    MARIN

          Okay. Sorry. Over 31?

                     HARRY

          Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
          Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
          ass.
               (answers phone)
          Hold on. . .
               (then to Marin)
          It just so happens, my dear, that women
          of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
          think of it that way? No, it's always me.
          You dames are all alike.
               (then into phone)
          Hey...

                    MARIN

              (amused, to herself)
          Dames...
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.

                    BARRY

              (into phone)
          Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
          else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
          find me. Who?
              (glances at Marin, she's
               not listening)
          I'll call her later. No, I have it.
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
and the ocean stretch before them.




                                                          5.











                    MARIN

              (all business)
          Make a right, left at the second
          fence.
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
came over her, looks out the window.

                    HARRY

          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
          breasts look in this sweater?

                    MARIN

              (blushing)
          Yes you have actually.

                     HARRY

          So it would be too much to mention it
          again. . .
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.

                    HARRY

          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.

                    MARIN

          I know. My mother doesn't know how
          to do things that aren't perfect.

                    HARRY

          Which explains you.
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought.

                    MARIN

              (trying to keep up with
               him)
          Yeah, okay, right...
They both grab their H
                     overnight bags and step out of the car.

                     ARRY

          So, what are we gonna do out here,
          just the two of us, for two whole
          days?
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
around his neck.

                    MARIN

          Tell me the truth, are you at all
          glad we waited?




                                                            6.











                       HARRY

             I'm incredibly glad we're finally
             going to do it.
                 (she's a bit disappointed)
             If that's the same as being glad we
             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
lets you kiss them.

                       HARRY

                 (slaps her tush)
             Let's go for a swim, how long will
             it take you to change?

                       MARIN

             Two minutes.
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
cigars.

                         MARIN

             Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
             Mom doesn't allow it.

                       HARRY

             But she allows you to strip in the
             front yard and bring men you're
             dating here to...

                       MARIN

             She doesn't know everything I do...Or
             when I do it.. or where I do it.
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.







INT. HOUSE

It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress.

                       MARIN

                 (TAKING OFF her belt)
             The fabulous living room, perfect for
             entertaining an intimate group of friends
             or that special someone.
                 (DROPS her belt then
                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
             complete with pool and ocean view.




                                                           7.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
          Your pants, please...

                    HARRY

          Ladies first.
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.

                    MARIN

          Gourmet kitchen's to your left
          where tonight I will whip you up a
          culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.

                    MARIN

              (smiling)
          .. O-kay, going quickly now...
          Master bedroom is that away...
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.

                     M


                     ARIN

          And this as they say on 'Cribs',
          your favorite show, is where the
          magic happens. Do we like it? Going
          once, going twice ...

                    HARRY

          Sold.
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
ass.

                    MARIN

          You know when I first started
          auctioneering someone told me if I was
          nervous to just picture everyone in the
          audience in their underwear. This sort of
          gives that a whole new meaning.

                    HARRY

          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?

                    MARIN

          I'm always a little nervous.

                    HARRY

              (removing his hands)
          So put on your bathing suit. I brought
          some champagne, I'll put it on ice.




                                                         8.











                    MARIN

          Me like you, Harry Langer.
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom.
Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
the mirror, sucks in his gut.







INT. KITCHEN

Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
conversation.
One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
Younger Sister, ZOE.
ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking

                     E

out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.

                     RICA

          Oh God. What is this?
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.

                    ERICA

              (in control)
          Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
          knife.




                                                         9.











                    HARRY

              (eyeing the knife)
          Do you... live here?

                    ERICA

          Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
          911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
          hand me the phone.
              (reaches out to Zoe
               without looking at her)

                    HARRY

          You don't understand. I'm a friend
          of your daughter's.
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..

                    ERICA

          Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
          the city and you what, wandered in
          here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
              (looks at phone)
          Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
              (redials)

                    HARRY

              (calmly starts to move)
          Honestly, if you just...

                    ERICA

          Back off. She was in the Israeli
          army. She can break you in half.
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
whatsoever.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          Yes. I have an intruder in my
          house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.

                    HARRY

          I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
          invited me here for the weekend.
          She's in her room right now,
          changing.

                     ERICA

              (GASPS even louder, really
                   scared now)
          You're dating my daughter?




                                                        10.











                    HARRY

              (amused)
          Now who would've thought that would
          be worse news?
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
phone.

                      MARIN

          Oh, fuck.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God.
              (into phone)
          I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
          sure. No, he's not a burglar
              (with enormous difficulty)
          He's dating my daughter.

                    MARIN

          Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
          this weekend, you said you had to write.

                    ERICA

          I do. I thought I'd do it out here.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, this is really....

                      ERICA

          Awkward.

                    MARIN

          Totally.. .but....
              (starts laughing)
          You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
          he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
          don't know the man. . .

                    MARIN

              (still laughing)
          I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
          I'm an idiot. I should've told you
          I was bringing someone out.

                    E


                      RICA

          No, no, I should've told you we
          were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
          are.
               (waves to Harry)
          Hello. I'm the mother.




                                                        11.










All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...

                    HARRY

          Harry Langer. How are ya?

                     MARIN

          Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
          Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
          Zoe.
               (they all shake hands)
          Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
          mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
          totally spur of the moment thought we'd
          get out of the city for a few days.

                    ERICA AND ZOE

          Of course...Right...Great...

                    ERICA

              (can't look at him)
          Honey, does Harry have a robe?

                     HARRY

              (backing out)
          You know what? Actually, I think I should
          just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
          weekend...
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!

                    ERICA

          No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
          here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
          leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
          we'll go into town for lunch. You two
          stay. Harry, apologize about the near
          arrest.

                      HARRY

          No, you were impressive. Very strong,
          very... "macho".

                    ERICA

              (a little thrown)
          I don't think I was exactly "macho"

          ...


                    HARRY

          Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
          his underwear in my refrigerator I
          hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs
          uh...




                                                        12.











                    ERICA

              (already hating him)
          Yeah. Okay. Whatever...
Marin watches. Dying.

                    HARRY

          All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
          hit the road.
              (salutes Erica and Zoe)
          Ladies...sensational meeting you.
              (then to Marin)
          Doll, call me.

                    ZOE

          Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
          dramatic here. What are we four
          teenagers? We're all sophisticated
          people. Why can't we all stay, for the
          weekend? Your mother's got work to do
          I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
          thing, whatever that is and if we want to
          hang together, we'll hang together. If we
          don't, we don't. There's no reason why
          any of us should give up this spectacular
          weekend.

                    MARIN

          Seriously. I can handle it.

                    ZOE

          I can totally handle it.

                    ERICA

              (on the spot)
          I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
resist.

                    HARRY

          It can only go up from here.

                                                   CUT TO:








HARRY AND MARIN

Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are
both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.

                     Z


                     OE (V.O.)

          He's obviously a penis substitute.




                                                        13.














ERICA AND ZOE

Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.

                    ZOE

          I mean a father substitute.

                    ERICA

          Except he's older than her father. I
          can't even look at them. What is she
          doing with a guy that age?

                    ZOE

          Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

                    ERICA

          Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

                    ZOE

          Okay, so she was old enough not to
          feel Dave was walking out on her.

                    ERICA

          Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
          on me? Why do people assume when you
          break up after twenty years that the
          guy's the one who wanted out? Just
          because once we broke up he shtupped
          everything that moved...

                    ZOE

          Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
          Just trying to figure out why such a
          smart girl is always with the wrong guy.







CLOSE ON A YOUNG FRENCH GIRL IN AN APRON


                    YOUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir
          aujourd'hui?
The Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:







THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA

A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as
rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of
the Cheese Counter.

                    ERICA

          Bonjour je veux une partie de votre
          pate merveilleux et de votre
          meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.




                                                        14.










Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
one ear.

                    HARRY

          That's impressive.

                    MARIN

          She started French lessons after she and
          my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,
          Don't Look Back" program. She's
          practically fluent now.

                    ERICA

              (turning back to Marin)
          Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou
          devrions jefaire quelgue chose?

                    MARIN

              (with an impeccable
               accent)
          Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et
          ce grand gateau de chocolat?

                    HARRY

          Hey, not bad.. .

                    MARIN

              (shrugs)
          Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right
          back.
Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and
catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks
his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.

                    ERICA

          It's an epidemic.
Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package.

                     Y


                     OUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Merci madame.
Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to
her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

                    ERICA

              (backing off)
          Woops. Sorry.




                                                           15.











                      HARRY

          My fault.
They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
alongside her.

                    ERICA

          So, Harry... What do you do?

                    HARRY

          I'm one of the owners of a record
          company among other things...

                    ERICA

          Oh, really? Which record company?

                    HARRY

          Drive by Records.

                    ERICA

              (appalled at the name)
          "Drive By" Records??? Is that a
          joke? What is that?

                    HARRY

          It's a Hip Hop label.

                    ERICA

          Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.
              (with disdain)
          Okay. That's... "interesting"...

                    HARRY

          Let me see if I get where you're
          headed here. . .

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
          rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
          and crude for my taste, not to mention
          just a tad misogynistic.

                    HARRY

          Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
          poetry.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but come on, how many words
          can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.

                    MARIN

              (joining Harry)
          How we doin?




                                                        16.











                    HARRY

          Should've left when she tried to arrest
          me.







INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.

                    MARIN

          So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
          happy with it?
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.

                    ERICA

          Well, the thing with me is that I'm about
          90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the
          talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, right...

                    HARRY

          What's your play about?
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.
She's hesitant to reveal this.

                    ERICA

          About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which
          is a bit of a problem, but so far it's
          about a divorced woman, a writer, she's
          this high strung, over-amped,
          controlling, know it all neurotic. . .
              (everyone stares at her)
          Who's incredibly cute and lovable.
              (more stares)
          It's a comedy.
              (takes a seat next to Zoe)

                    M

          So, how did you two meet?

                     ARIN

          At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
          the big buyer of the night.

                    HARRY

          I kept winking at Marin as she was
          conducting the auction and apparently
          every time I did that she misunderstood
          and I ended up buying cases of
          outrageously expensive wine.




                                                        17.










Zoe and Marin laugh.

                    ERICA

          Ever been married, Harry?

                    HARRY

          No. No, I haven't.

                    ERICA

          Wow. Now why do you think that is?

                    HARRY

          Some people just don't fit the mold. And
          so far...

                    ERICA

          Hey, if it ain't broke.

                       HARRY

          Exactly.
Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica
takes note.

                    ZOE

          Wait a second, aren't you like a famous
          bachelor?

                    HARRY

          I wouldn't say I'm famous.

                    ZOE

          No, I think I read a piece on you
          in New York Magazine.

                    HARRY

          I guess people find it interesting
          that I've escaped the noose for so
          long.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,
          "The Escape Artist"?

                    ERICA

          Wait. I read that article. That was you?
          You were once engaged to somebody big.
          Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
          ..Carly Simon?

                    ZOE

          Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.
              (trying to remember)
          Not Martha Stewart....




                                                18.











                    MARIN

          You could just ..'ask him.

                    HARRY

          No, this is more fun. It's like I'm
          not here.

                    MARIN

          Harry was once engaged to Diane
          Sawyer. Okay?

                    ZOE

          Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.

                    ERICA

              (stunned)
          I'm impressed.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, women your age love that
          about me.
Erica pauses on that one.

                    HARRY

              (trying to get thru this)
          You know what I mean.

                      ERICA

          Yes I do.

                     HARRY

          It's not a bad thing to say 'women
          your age'.

                    ERICA

          No...I'm sure it was a compliment.

                    HARRY

          It was. ..just the truth.

                    ZOE

              (stepping in)
          So when was this engagement?

                    HARRY

          Long time ago. She was just this
          adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
          with the greatest pair of legs I'd
          ever seen... Never understood her
          ending up with a job where she
          never showed them.
              (munches on his lobster)




                                      19.











          ERICA

You're not serious? She's Diane
Sawyer, she goes into caves in
Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
head. Who cares about her legs?

          HARRY

Just anyone who's ever had the
pleasure of... You know what? I
hate to eat and run but...

          ZOE

No, wait. This is actually a very
fascinating dynamic - what's going
on at this table...

          MARIN

    (warning him)

Z

 oe teaches Women's Studies at
Columbia. . .

          HARRY

Oh, so this is gonna hurt.

          ZOE

No, come on, listen, here's the rub
for women. Look at what we have
here with you and Erica. Harry,
you've been around the block a few
times, right? You're what? Around
60, never been married, which, we
all know, if you were a woman,
would be a curse, you'd be an old
maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
you, they write articles about you,
celebrate your never marrying, it
makes you illusive and ungettable.
You're a real catch. Then, take my
gorgeous sister here...

          ERICA

Any chance of you stopping here?

          ZOE

Come on, this is interesting. I
mean, look at her, she's so
accomplished, the most successful
woman playwright since who? Lillian
Hellman? She's over fifty,
divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available
guys her age want
    (to Marin)




                                                        20.

                     ZOE(cont'd)
           --forgive me honey for saying this,
           but they want girls that look like
           Marin so the whole over fifty
           dating scene is geared completely
           towards men leaving older women out
           and as a result that makes the
           older women more and more
           productive and more and more
           interesting, which, in turn, makes
           them even less desirable because as
           we all know -- men, especially
           older men, are threatened and
           deathly afraid of interesting and
           accomplished women. It's just so
           clear. Single older women, as a
           demographic, are as fucked a group
           as can ever exist.
Erica and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE

SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING.








INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

OVER, we
Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to
help.

                     ERICA

           What are you, possessed? How could
           you say those things?

                     ZOE

           It just seemed so obvious to me. The
           injustice of it. Thank God men die
           younger than us. It's the only break we
           get.

                     ERICA

           Then you know what? Write a dissertation
           on it, don't announce to the world that I
           stay in night after night after night and
           by the way, one night after night would
           have been enough. Did you ever realize, I
           stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you
           think I married the director of my plays?
           He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I
           like staying in and I like this time in
           my life. Why do I have to defend myself?
M          I was married for 20 years. I'm done.
 arin ENTERS carrying more dishes.

                     MARIN

           What the hell was that?




                                            21.











           ZOE

I'm sorry, I thought I was onto
something.

          ERICA

Honey, what are you doing with this
guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...

            MARIN

He's fun.

          ERICA

He's fun? How is he fun? He's
like.. .wrong.

          MARIN

Wrong can be fun, Mom.

          ERICA

Not this wrong.

          MARIN

Can we not do this now? He's
actually incredibly smart and
fascinating and if you had talked
to him about something other than
his marital status you would've
found out how smart he is. He owns
like 10 different companies...

          ERICA

What does that mean he owns ten
different companies? He can't
commit, that's what that means. Not
that, God forbid, I want him to
commit.

          MARIN

Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he
thought you two were very spontaneous and
nice and then said he's leaving as soon
as the sun comes up.

          ERICA

What? His car doesn't have
headlights?

          MARIN

Good night.

           ERICA

Wait. I have no right to get this
nuts.
     (hugs her)
He's your friend. Not mine. I love
you.




                                                         22.











                    MARIN

              (hugs her back)
          I love you more.
This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses
Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin

EXITS.


                    ZOE

          No chance he said we were nice.

                    ERICA

          Please. None.
They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.

                    ZOE

          What are they listening to?

                    ERICA

          I don't care...
              (listens)
          Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .
Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along,
"Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns
off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.

                    ERICA

          I know she'll never see him after
          this weekend. She can't commit
          either.
Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.

                    ZOE

          He does sound fun.
Marin YELPS.

                    ZOE

          Admit it, he's got something. You
          felt it, right?
Then they hear Marin SCREAM.

                    ERICA

          Oh, this is nuts...
Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear
Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"

                    ERICA

          Did she say, Mom?




                                                        23.














INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR

Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the
floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.
His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.

                      MARIN

           We were fooling around and he said he
           felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.

                      ARRY

               (out of breath)
           It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was
           the lobster...

                     ERICA

           Does your chest hurt?

                     HARRY

           Like an elephant's standing on it.

                     ERICA

               (to Marin)
           Call 911...tell them to send an
           ambulance. . .
Marin hesitates.

                     ERICA

           Marin! Now!







HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM

Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.
BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the
background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
hears Zoe:

                     ZOE(O.S.)

           What are you doing?

                     ERICA

               (coming closer)
           Mouth to mouth...

ON HARRY

Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.
mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica
catches this.

                     ERICA

           You fucking guy...




                                                        24.










She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his
lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.
As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A

SIREN...








AND A LOUD CLANG

As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics
WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with
dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and

ONTO A BED.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his
early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you
look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man
whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier
than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins
graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.
The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a
heart monitor and connect him to an IV.

                    JULIAN

          How we doing here?

                    PARAMEDIC #1

          He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,
          respirations 18...

                     JULIAN

          Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm
          Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
          right now?
The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
up.

                    HARRY

          Feel some pressure in my
          chest...it's real tight.

                    JULIAN

          Can you show me where the pain is?
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.

                    JULIAN

          What were you doing at the onset of
          the pain?

                    HARRY

          I was uh, kissing a beautiful...




                                                        25.











                    JULIAN

              (watching the monitor)
          Where you having intercourse?

                    HARRY

          -- Unfortunately, no.

                    JULIAN


          S

           ense of humor in tact...
              (checks EKG)
          Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.
          Langer the EKG shows you have a
          blocked artery which is not
          allowing enough oxygen to get to
          the heart muscle.. .

                    HARRY

          I'm having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

          We're gonna stop it. But I need to
          know what kind of medications you
          take?

                    HARRY

              (scared shitless)
          I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .

                    JULIAN

              (reading the EKG tape)
          Uh-huh... .Any thing else?

                    HARRY

          -- and a white one for blood
          pressure. . .

                       JULIAN

          procardia?

                       HARRY

          Yeah.

                    JULIAN

          What about, Viagra?
Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry
eyes them...stalls.

                    JULIAN

          Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra
          today? Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          No. No Viagra.




                                                        26.











                    JULIAN

          You're positive?

                    HARRY

          I don't take Viagra. Don't need
          Viagra.
The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
there. They turn away.

                    JULIAN

          Great. Just needed to be sure
          because I put nitroglycerin into
          your-drip and if you had taken
          Viagra, the combo would make your
          heart leap right out of your
          body...







CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.

                    JULIAN

          Let's give him an aspirin and
          Metoprolol 5mg...

                    HARRY

          Sorry, had an audience...
              (clutching his chest)

                    JULIAN

          It's okay. ..it was a great save.
              (to Nurse)
          Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
          "4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
          this works and I have every reason to
          believe it will, it's going to reverse
          what's going on so there will be little
          or no damage to your heart. You with me?
              (Harry nods. Julian places
               his hand on Harry's)
          Okay, here we go.

THE HALLWAY

Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, what if he doesn't make
          it? I don't know who to contact.




                                                           27.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I don't know his family. I've gone
          out to dinner with the guy three
          times. I hardly know him.

                    ERICA

          He's gonna make it. Don't worry.

                    M

          He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.

                     ARIN

          This is a nightmare. I go out with
          a guy who's so old, he takes
          Viagra.

                    ERICA

          Are you nuts? You go out with a guy
          who's so old he's having a heart
          attack!

                    ZOE

          All I can say is, thank God it didn't
          happen when he was inside you. That could
          be life altering.
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
him, her face begging for good news.

                    JULIAN

          Your Dad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

          Oh, he's not my Dad...

                     JULIAN

          I'm sorry.
              (then)
          Your Grandad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

              (throws her arms around
               him)
          Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...
          oh we're not related. He's just a friend.

                    JULIAN

          Sorry.
His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
Erica join them.

                    JULIAN

          I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
          mild heart attack. I gave him something
          to break up the clot in his artery and it
          worked beautifully.




                                                        28.











                    JULIAN (CONT'D)

          His EKG returned to normal almost
          immediately which means I don't expect
          any permanent damage. He's very lucky.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Thank you. . .

                    JULIAN

          No, whoever got him here so fast should
          be thanked. Another half hour and I don't
          know if this would've worked.
Marin pats her Mom on the back.

                     ERICA

          Oh, man...
              (realizing it all now)
          This was...intense.
Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.

                    JULIAN

          We're out of the woods. I've given him
          something to sleep, it might make him a
          little loopy at first but then it should
          knock him out.
              (to Erica)
          You're Mrs. Langer?

                    ERICA

          No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .
          He was having dinner at our house. I just
          met him this afternoon.

                    JULIAN

          You're Erica Barry?

                    ERICA

          Yes.

                    JULIAN

          The playwright?

                    ERICA

          Yes...

                    JULIAN

          What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.
          Huge fan.

                    ERICA

          Really? Oh, thanks... This is my
          daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe...




                                                        29.










Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and
devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.

                    JULIAN

          Wow.







CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT

Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups.







MARIN - CLOSE

Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER
FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with
more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on

                     M

the steam.

                     ARIN

          Thanks.
Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed
a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.

                    ZOE

          Thank you Doctor.
This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters
trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not
paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea.

                    ERICA

          Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.

                    JULIAN

              (eyes on Erica)
          You're welcome. May I join you?

                    ERICA

          Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of
          you.

                    JULIAN

          First year of medical school you
          learn what can keep you up all
          night without making you nuts.
          Green Tea beats everything plus
          it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.

                    MARIN

              (turning on the charm)
          So, urn, do you always work nights?




                                                  30.











                    JULIAN

          Usually two or-three a week, gives
          me a chance for a real life during
          the day. . .
              (immediately turns back to
               Erica)
          You know, I heard you had a place
          in the Hamptons. I really am a very
          big fan. I honestly think I've seen
          every play you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          I think some were written before
          your time. There are some Marin's
          never even seen.

                    JULIAN

          No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them
          all and I saw the last one twice.
Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.

                    NURSE

          Doctor, we've got a walk in, may
          need stitches. . .

                    JULIAN

              (rises)
          I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's
          asleep; you all might want to get
          some shut eye and come back in the
          morning. Great to meet you Erica.
          Ladies. . .
The Women wave and watch him exit.
The second he's gone:

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Okay, now that's a perfect a guy
          for you. He's adorable.

                    MARIN

          Mother! I've never seen a man less
          interested in me.

                    ZOE

          Or more interested in you.

                    ERICA

          Me? He's thirty years old.

                    MARIN

          No, he's older than that.




                                                        31.











                    ZOE

          Who cares how old, he is. I mean,
          he's not my type, he's like a
          gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's
          perfect for you and hot for you,
          which makes him really perfect.

                    ERICA

          Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.
              (they just stare at her)
          It's insane. I would never.
              (off Zoe's look)
          Shut. Up.
Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital

                     Z

Gown, pretty out of it.

                     OE

          Yuh-oh.

                    MARIN

              (rises)
          Harry....
Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women
a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.

                    MARIN

          Harry! Over here!
He faces them.

                    HARRY

          Honey, I want to go home. Can you
          call Lowell to pick me up?

                    MARIN

              (confused)
          Lowell?
Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to
her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.

                    ERICA

          Harry, you have to get back in bed.

                    HARRY

          Woman. And I say that as a
          compliment... You saved my life.
              (kisses her hand)
          Soft.. .
              ( then)
          I don't remember your name but I
          thank you from the bottom of my...




                                                        32.










He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,
his mouth open.

                    ERICA

              (afraid to breathe)
          Ugh. Look at this, even
          unconscious, he's a lech.
The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.

                    NURSE

          Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be
          standing.

                    HARRY

          Got to take a whiz girls.

                    NURSE

          We'll take care of that for you,
          Mr. Langer.
Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.
LOVES that idea.

                    HARRY

          Okay. You take care of it for me,
          sweetheart. I'd like to see that...
As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
desert sky.

                    MARIN

          This is the most insane night of my
          life.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, but just admit that was one
          great ass for a guy that age.







CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER

A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station.

                    NURSE

          Now what can I do you for?
She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties,
Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie. He's a Gershwin tune
of a man. A throwback to a kinder world. This is. LOWELL,
Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday.

                    LOWELL

          I'm here for Mr. Harry Langer.
Julian ENTERS the Nurse's station.




                                                        33.











                    NURSE

              (to Julian)
          Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?

                    JULIAN

          Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
          Come on, I'll take you to him.
Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the
flowers, follows. He nods to TWO TALL LEGGY MINI SKIRTED
ASSISTANT TYPES, KIM and LEXI who follow. Both pack cell

                     J

phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags.

                     ULIAN

          And you are. . ?

                    LOWELL

          Lowell St. James'. Mr. Langer's
          houseman, chef... general valet..

                    JULIAN

          Well that sounds like a pretty,
          interesting job.

                    LOWELL

          Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.
They arrive at:







A PRIVATE ROOM

where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go. He
squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called,
"Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".

                    JULIAN

          Okay, Harry, looks like we're going
          to have to let you go.
Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks
like he might cry. The Girls hold back.

                    HARRY

          Take it easy kids, I just sat up
          too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
          good shape? How were my tests this
          morning?

                    JULIAN

          He's doing extremely well.

                    LOWELL

              (holding back tears)
          Can I hug him?




                                                           34.











                    JULIAN

          Absolutely.
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's
shoulders shake as he sobs.

                    HARRY

          Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We
          got no thin , but good news here.

                    LOWELL

          I must say, you do look good...
          considering. You have a little
          extra baggage under your eyes, but
          I know how to fix that.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          See what good hands I'm in. Did you
          meet my gorgeous assistants?

                    JULIAN

          Not formally.

                     HARRY

          Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.
              (then)
          Honey, did you bring the CDs?
Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          These are for you...
              (to the Girls)
          The man loves Hip Hop.

                    JULIAN

              (checking out the bag)
          Maybe not this much but...

                    HARRY

          And did you bring the other thing?
Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out
a small leather box, hands it to Julian.

                    HARRY

          This is just to thank you for your
          brilliance the other night. I hope
          it suits you.

                    JULIAN

              (opening the box)
          Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the
          most gorgeous watch I've ever seen.




                                                        35.











                    HARRY

          - Oh, good. It's a Piaget.
              (to Girls)
          He likes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, I love it and this is incredibly
          generous of you but I can't accept it.

                    HARRY

          You save my life and you end up
          with some CDs?

                    JULIAN

          No, I end up seeing you walk out of
          here and I do get paid you know -

                    MARIN (O.S.)

          -- Knock, knock.

T

 hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry,
more reserved than normal.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'll see you on the way out.

                    LOWELL

              (whispers)
          We'll pull up the car.
Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on
the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.
All she notices is his hospital bracelet.

                    HARRY

          So, I'm some great date, huh?

                    MARIN

          Yeah... Mr. Excitement.

                    HARRY

          Tell me somethin', we haven't actually
          had sex yet, have we?

                    MARIN

          No we haven't. You're correct on
          that one.

                    HARRY

          Something to live for.
Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.




                                                        36.











                    HARRY

          Down to the cheek.
              (that's big, he digests
               that one)
          Come on, let's get outta here.







EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on
either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and
the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting
by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and
tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.

                    NURSE

          Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
              (she stops)
          Okay, now slow-ly.
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,
ready to help.

                    HARRY

          Look at these faces. Will you tell them
          I'm fine.
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.

                    ERICA

          Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE

SCREEN GOES BLACK.








CLOSE ON JULIAN

taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin
huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the
          gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.

                    HARRY

          I ain't goin' back in there.

                    JULIAN

          You don't have to but I can't put you in
          a car right now and I can't leave you in
          the parking lot. I'd like you to stay
          nearby for a few days and let me keep an
          eye on you 'til you get your strength
          back.




                                                        37.











                    HARRY

          Doc, I'm out in the middle of the
          Hamptons. Where do you want me to go?
Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,
talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a
Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID
holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.

I





 NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit
cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower
filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim
stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Just promise me you won't make a decision until
          we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me.
          Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...
              (hangs up, then to Lowell)
          Lowell, what was that?

                    LOWELL

              (looking down at the Tray)
          Your lunch.

                    HARRY

          Somebody tell you to starve me to death?
Kim hands Harry the cell phone.

                     KIM

          Russell.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.
          I just got a clean bill of health.
Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:







          YOU HAVE TWO DINNER DATES THIS WEEK,


          SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?





                                                        38.










Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.







INT. KITCHEN

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a
Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a
sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

                    DAVE

          This is the best turkey sandwich I
          ever had in my life. What kind of
          mustard is this?

                    ERICA

              (not turning around)
          I don't know.

                    DAVE

          All right, don't get pissy. It's
          not Dijon, right?

                    ERICA

          Don't get pissy. ..you say that 'cause
          this, of course, would never happen to
          you. .1 come out here for peace and quiet
          and suddenly I'm a character in a Kaufman
          and Hart play.
              (the phone RINGS)
          And the phone does not stop.
              (phone STOPS RINGING)
          And it's never for me!
Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.

                    LOWELL

          Sorry to interrupt.

                    ERICA

          That's fine Lowell, I'll take that.

                    LOWELL

          No, please, allow me.

                    ERICA

          No, no, I'll take it. No problem.
Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.

                    ERICA

          The man does not know my name and
          I'm doing his dishes.
Lexi ENTERS, all 5'10" of her. Dave suddenly looks alive. She
carries an empty water glass.




                                                          39.











                    LEX

          Hi Erica. Um...where should I put

                    E

          this?

                     RICA

          Right here. I'll take it.

                    LEXI

          And Harry has a headache. Do you
          have any Tylenol?

                    ERICA

          Tylenol yes. ..
              (reaches in cabinet)

                     LEXI

              (extends her hand to Dave)
          Hi. I'm Lexi, Harry's second
          assistant.

                    DAVE

          Hey...Dave Klein. How ya doin'?
Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and EXITS.

                    ERICA

              (holding the water glass)
          Where should I put this? It's an
          empty water glass. What are the
          choices?

                    DAVE

              (rises)
          I'm gettin' outta your hair.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.

                    DAVE

          So you're not ready to show me any
          pages? I'm not putting pressure on
          you, I'm just asking.

                    ERICA

          I haven't written a word. I'm on
          page twelve and the first eleven
          pages stink.

                      DAVE

          So you have one good page.
               (then)
          How tall do you think that girl
          was?
Before Erica can respond, Marin ENTERS.




                                                        40.











                    MARIN

          Dad! I didn't know you were here.

                    DAVE

          I'm just on my way out, bubbee.

                    MARIN

          Well, I was just gonna drive into the
          city with Zoe but if you're driving back,
          I'd much rather go with you.

                    DAVE

          I have to meet someone before I go...

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's
          leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I'm
          supposed to stay here with him alone?

                    MARIN

          The doctor said" he's 'sending over
          a Nurse in the morning...

                       ERICA

          The morning? That's nineteen hours from
          now...
                 (takes a deep breath)
          Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going
          to get into a zen' place, play music,
          cook, write, focus...

                    DAVE

          She never changes...

                    ERICA

              (setting him straight)
          Yes. Maybe that's a good thing.







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET

No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack
we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          Smells great in here.
Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway
in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more
gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.




                                                        41.











                    ERICA

          Coq au Vin...
              (he looks confused)

                    H

          Chicken cooked in red wine...

                     ARRY

          French Food... French music...

                    ERICA

          Part of my play takes place in Paris so
          I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm
          hopin'...How you feeling?

                    HARRY

          Well, I walked all the way in here,
          only bumping into two chairs and an
          ottoman.

                    ERICA

          Everyone bumps into that ottoman.
Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become
awkward, the Phone RINGS.

                    HARRY

          Hey, thanks for letting me...

                    ERICA

          Yeah, no...it's fine.
              (answering the phone)
          Hello. Yes, he is.
              (hands the phone to Harry)

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey sweets...
              (Erica hates this)
          Oh, you got the flowers? Are they
          pretty?
Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her
recipe.

                    HARRY

          Hey, can I call you in a little
          bit. What's your number doll?
              (spots a pad and pencil)
Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head
away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (slips them on, jots down
               the number)
          Okay... Call you in a little.




                                                          42.










Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica.

                    HARRY

          Same prescription...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch
          of the imagination, I think you're all
          that right for my daughter but I don't
          really appreciate hearing you on the
          phone with other women. It's like I'm an
          accomplice to you cheating, it's...

                    HARRY

          Your daughter knows I see other women.

                    ERICA

          She does? I mean, fine, it's none
          of my business...but...
              (struggles to open a
               bottle of wine)

                    HARRY

          She knows I'm not monogamous...We've
          discussed it.

                    ERICA

          Great? And that's what? Why are you
          proud of that?

                    HARRY

          Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter
          said she likes that about me.
              (takes the wine and opens
               it with ease.)

                    ERICA

          My daughter is confused when it comes to men.

                    HARRY

          I don't blame her. We're confusing.
Harry hands her the open wine bottle.







EXT. BEACH PATIO








WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT

Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table,
under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't
them, this would look romantic.

N

 othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt
shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.




                                                        43.











                    ERICA

          Should I just call the ambulance now?
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the
table.







EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE

A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE

PHONE RING.








INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us
it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she
points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry
answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her
remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other
line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT
"BLINK, while the other line is answered.

                    ERICA

          What am I doing?
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.
She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE
BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is
unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,
laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands
in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

                     HARRY

               (into phone)
          Can you hold a see, doll?
               (looks to Erica)
          Hey.

                     ERICA

          Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
          want to play the part of the uptight
          Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
          want to have another heart attack, go
          ahead, it's your life but I have work to
          do and I don't have time to make another
          run to the hospital because you're
          filling your already clogged arteries
          with smoke but more importantly, I'd
          rather not have my house smell like a
          pool hall.




                                                        44.










Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to
deposit his cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I have a question for you.
She waits. She doesn't say anything.

                     ERICA

          What? Do I Hhave to say what?

                     ARRY

          Have you always been like this or
          do I bring this out in you?
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops
the cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've ever had this
          effect on a woman before.

                    ERICA

              (picking up the
               newspapers)
          And what effect do you think you're
          having on me?

                    HARRY

          I don't quite recognize it, that's how I
          know I've never had it before.
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.

                    HARRY

          So you don't sleep?

                    ERICA

          I only need about four hours a night.

                    HARRY

          Me too. Never slept eight hours in my
          life.

                    ERICA

          Me either. I wish I could. ..but...
              (re: curtains)
          Want me to shut these, sun comes in
          pretty strong in the morning.

                    HARRY

          Sure. . . thanks. . .

                    ERICA

              (drawing the drapes)
          Who you talking to at this hour?




                                                        45.











                    HARRY

          A friend in L.A. It's only ten out there.

                    ERICA

          And that's not past her bedtime?

                    HARRY

          So you don't get more mellow as the hours
          pass?

                    ERICA

              (heading out)
          Good night, Harry.

                    HARRY

          Can I ask you one other thing?
              (Erica turns)
          What's with the turtlenecks? It's
          the middle of summer.

                    ERICA

          Now seriously, why do you care what I
          wear?

                    HARRY

          Just curious.

                    ERICA

          I like them. I've always liked them. I'm
          just a turtleneck kinda gal.

                    HARRY

          You ever get hot?

                    ERICA

          No.

                    HARRY

          Never?

                    ERICA

          Not lately.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with
the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,
takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica
turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled
her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't
like it. She stands, starts to undress.

ANGLE - THE FLOOR





                                                        46.










As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her
PANTS then her PANTIES.

ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT

She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She
passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO

THE HALLWAY AND SEES:


HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

Seeing it all.

ERICA - SCREAMS

and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.

HARRY

flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the
wall, covers his eyes.

                    HARRY

          I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          What are you doing?!?

                    HARRY

          Trying to find the kitchen!

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          Back here???

                    HARRY

          I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't
          really see anything. Just your tits and a
          little of your-
Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake.

                    HARRY

          This is gonna be murder.







INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.

                    NURSE

          Good bye Mrs. Barry.




                                                        47.











                    ERICA

          Good bye? You're leaving? That's
          not good.

                    NURSE

          Been fired.

                     ERICA

          Fired?   You just started.

                    HARRY

          Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.

                    ERICA

          What do you mean, not needed? Of
          course we need her. She's gonna
          take care of you and feed you and...

                    HARRY

          -- No, no, I'm actually feeling
          pretty perky today. Making quite a
          recovery. . .
              (opening the screen door)
          Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
          Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.

                    HARRY

          Listen, about last night.

                    ERICA

          Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
              (hands him some pills)
          I was at the drugstore. Your
          prescriptions were ready. They said take
          these two with food and this one without.

                    HARRY

          Honestly, you were in silhouette.

                    ERICA

          I think that's talkin' about it.

                    HARRY

          I really didn't see all that much.




                                                        48.











                    ERICA

              (heading toward her room)
          Yip. There you go.

                    HARRY

          Okay. Won't mention it again but...

                    ERICA

              (almost out of the room)
          Goin' to work, Harry.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          You saw my ass, you don't see me
          acting nuts, wearing hats and
          glasses and weird get ups...
The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM

Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood
pressure.

                    HARRY

          Yes or no. What's the deal, can I
          go?

                    JULIAN

          You still getting dizzy?

                    HARRY

          Not as much.

                    JULIAN

          Out of breath?

                    HARRY

          Only sometimes.

                    JULIAN

              (listens with stethoscope)
          How's Erica treating you?

                       HARRY

          Who?

                     JULIAN

              (nods toward Living Room)
          Erica. . .

                    HARRY

          Her? Oh, she's a major piece of
          work. The woman wears turtlenecks
          in the middle of the summer.




                                                      49.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          She's beyond uptight. Almost makes
          her fun to be around.

                    JULIAN

          Uptight? That's funny. I haven't
          noticed that.

                    HARRY

          Try livin' with her.
Julian takes Harry's pulse.

                    HARRY

              (with secret glee)
          I actually saw her naked last
          night.

                    JULIAN

          That doesn't sound so uptight.

                    HARRY

          It was an accident. She thought I
          was asleep, I thought her room was
          the kitchen.

                    JULIAN

          You know what Freud said - there
          are no accidents.

                    HARRY

          Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
          why would she be walking around naked
          when she knows I'm 20 feet away.

                    JULIAN

          Why would you think her bedroom was
          the kitchen?

                    HARRY

          It was dark, it was two in the
          morning.

                    JULIAN

          That could explain why she was walking
          around naked. Deep breath...

                    HARRY

          You know I've never seen a woman
          that age naked before.

                    JULIAN

          You're kidding?

                    HARRY

          Hey, we're not all doctors.




                                                        50.











                    JULIAN

          Well, I think she's very beautiful
          and she's a fantastic writer, you
          know.

                    HARRY

          No, I don't know...

                    JULIAN

          Erica Barry? She's pretty major.
              (writing a prescription)
          So, you date her daughter?

                     HARRY

          Okay, now she's a great chick. Must take
          after the father. Which reminds me...Doc,
          what (about Mr. Midnight here. . ?
                indicates his dick)
          When can I be up and running in
          that department?

                    JULIAN

          I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay
          put for another couple of weeks.

                    HARRY

          But it won't kill me when I do it, right?

                    JULIAN

          It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And
          just so you know, I'm told after a heart
          attack, if you can climb a flight of
          stairs, you can have sex.

                                                  CUT TO:








A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE

Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at
the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and
sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's
Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one
more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,
yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up
one more.







INT . KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either
side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.




                                                        51.











                    ERICA

          So, you're saying, he's not ready
          to travel at all? Not even by
          plane? Train?

                    JULIAN

          I don't think so...
              (sees her disappointment)
          It's been tough, huh?

                    ERICA

          Well, he fired the Nurse after an
          hour, now says he doesn't need one.
          He's a bit of a workout.. .yeah.

                    JULIAN

          How are you holding up?

                    ERICA

          Oh, fine. .I'm fine, I'm...

                    JULIAN

          One more fine and I won't believe you.
The Phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Oh, shoot, hold on...
              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...







ANGLE - JULIAN

Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.







ANGLE - ERICA

Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          No, I'm finally getting to it...
Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks
over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.
On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks
up at him. Stunned. J

                     ULIAN

              (heading out)
          Pick you up around seven?

                    ERICA

          W-What about the patient?




                                                          52.











                    JULIAN

          Like he said, he doesn't need a
          nurse.
We begin to hear strains of another French song.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER

Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD
player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this
attention from Julian has fueled her.







THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a
summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.

                    HARRY

              (yells, warning-like)
          I'm Walking Around The house!
ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at
her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.

                    ERICA

          Listen, I've decided to get over the
          whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
          don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?

                    HARRY

          Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
          you all day.

                    ERICA

          I know. You want to come in?

                    HARRY

          I don't want to break your rhythm
          or anything.

                    ERICA

          That would be wishful thinking.
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.

                    HARRY

          Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
          venture out there and go for a
          short walk...

                    ERICA

          You up to that?




                                                        53.











                    HARRY

          My doctor recommended it. I gotta
          build up to stairs and stuff like
          that. You wouldn't want to join me?

                    ERICA

          That means you don't want me to?

                    HARRY

          No, I was asking if you wanted to.

                    ERICA

          Oh, well, I would but...I don't
          usually like to break once I've
          started writing so I probably
          shouldn't, not that a little fresh
          air would hurt but...

                    HARRY

          It's just a walk Erica, not a
          marriage proposal.

                    ERICA

          You know my name.

                    HARRY

          Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
          on the internet.







EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY

Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
two people on the beach.

                    HARRY

          -- Did you know there are over eight
          thousand websites that mention you?

                    ERICA

          That can't be possible.

                    HARRY

          No, it's true. I know everything
          about you now. And not because of
          last night, but...

                    E


                     RICA

          Yeah, I understood. I actually
          looked you up too. You grew up in
          L.A., which I thought nobody did.




                                                         54.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          You were the road manager for a group I
          sorta never heard of, started your own
          record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
          started buying and selling boutique
          companies then invested in a small record
          company which you turned into the 2nd
          largest Hip Hop label in the world.

                    HARRY

          It's exhausting just hearing about it.

                    ERICA

          I know, but the truth is, it goes
          fast doesn't it?

                    HARRY

          Like the blink of an eye.
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
another and another...

                    HARRY

          I noticed you have bowls of those
          all over your house.

                    ERICA

          I know, I'm crazy, I just think
          they're so beautiful...

                    HARRY

          But why do you only pick up the white
          ones?

                    ERICA

          I don't only pick up the white ones.

                    HARRY

          Oh, so you really are crazy.

                    ERICA

          I pick up only the white ones?
              (looks in her hand)
          Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
          controlling, unadventurous, what?

                    HARRY

          So you're as hard on yourself as
          you are on everyone else.
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
stones.

                    HARRY

          Something to remember me by.




                                                        55.










Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.

                    ERICA

          So can I ask you something Harry? What's
          with all the young girls? I mean, what's
          the story there, really?

                    HARRY

          I just like to travel light.

                    ERICA

          You just like to travel light? Oh,
          please, what the hell does that mean?

                    HARRY

          Now see a thirty year old gets that.

                    ERICA

          You mean falls for that.

                    HARRY

          I mean, accepts it.

                    ERICA

          If that's what you want... a non
          threatening woman, who won't get your
          number, you get to run the show...

                    HARRY

          I think our relationship is growing
          by the way. Have you noticed?
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.

                    HARRY

          I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
          out of the house. Now, you may notice,
          interestingly, we're walking back toward
          the house and its getting a little rocky
          again.

                    ERICA

          Of course it's getting a little
          rocky, we're talking about you.

                    HARRY

          See, I'll accept that slight
          hostility because I'm enjoying your
          company so much.

T

 hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
up, daunted.

                      ERICA

          You okay?




                                                           56.











                    HARRY

          Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
          watch the sunset. You interested?
Erica checks her watch.

                    HARRY

          Big dinner date?

                    ERICA

          Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
          With your doctor.

                    HARRY

          Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
          too young for you, huh?

                    ERICA

          No, he's totally too young for me.
          But we're just having dinner. It's
          not a date.

                    HARRY

          Does he know that?

                    ERICA

          Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
          that he thinks of it that way.

                    HARRY

          I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
          may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
          not threatening, won't get your number,
          you get to run the show. You might have a
          hell of a time.
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.







THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN

And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
Dream Date.

AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.

                    JULIAN

          Hey, look who's answering the door.

                    HARRY

          And look who's at the door.

                    JULIAN

          Brought you something.




                                                        57.










Julian hands him a take-out food box.

                     JULIAN

          A heart healthy dinner from our
          cafeteria.

                       ERICA (O.S.)

          Hello...
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.

                    JULIAN

          You look beautiful.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.

                    ERICA

              (thrown)
          We ready..?

                    JULIAN

          Let me just see how Harry's doing.
          It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
          seat. .







ANGLE - HARRY

sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
ahead.







WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS

as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
JULIAN furrows his brow.

                    HARRY

          What? That's not the face you want
          to see your doctor making.

                     JULIAN

          Your pulse is a little fast but
          maybe you're just excited about
          something.
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.




                                                         58.











                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          I don't think so. I'm not excited
          about anything.
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.

                    JULIAN

          There it goes again. Racing.

                    HARRY

          Doc... Impossible!
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.

                    JULIAN

          Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
          Back to normal.
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them

OUT THE DOOR.


                    HARRY

          Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
          rush back for me and don't do anything I
          wouldn't do.

                    ERICA

          Well that wouldn't leave us too
          many options would it?

                    HARRY

          And do we wonder how she writes
          that snappy repartee.
              (whispers to Erica)
          Let him pick up the check. It'll
          make him feel older.
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.







INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS

Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to

                     M

his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:

                     ARIN (O.S.)

          Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
          a message and I'll call you back.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's me...just sitting around
          looking at your baby pictures...
          Thinking about you...




                                                          59.










He hangs up, dials another number.

                    ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

          Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
          Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
funky as he wants.

                    HARRY

          Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
          old old Har...
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
Harry smiles.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
stone sits at the top of the pile.

                    HARRY

              (complimented)
          Top of the heap...

CLOSE ON JULIAN

Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
first time in twenty-five years.

                    ERICA

          -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
          and the house was built in record time and...
              (blushing to death)
          It's like a thousand degrees in here.

                    JULIAN

          You know, they say doctors fall for
          people who need rescuing, that we have a
          need to take care of someone.

                    ERICA

          Really? I never heard that one.
              (starts fanning herself
               with the menu)
          Julian, how old are you, like...

                    JULIAN

          -- Thirty-three.




                                              60.











          ERICA

Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years
older than you.

          JULIAN

You look fabulous.

            ERICA

Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure
where you   were headed with that thing you
were just   saying, but in terms of us, you
just want   to be friends, right?

          JULIAN

Honestly? No.

          ERICA

Well, then, what is it that you...
want to be?

          J


           ULIAN

I think I'd embarrass you if I told
you.

          ERICA

I was embarrassed just getting
dressed to see you.

          JULIAN

This may surprise you but some
women consider me quite the guy.
I've never been married. I'm a
doctor. You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.

          ERICA

Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
girls your own age?

          JULIAN

I do very much. But I've never met one
I've taken to quite like this and when
something happens to you that's never
happened to you before, don't you have to
at least find out what it is?

          ERICA

I suppose but, see, I don't date
all that much or all that well...

          JULIAN

Oh, come on, you must beat them
away with a stick.




                                                          61.











                    ERICA

          Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
          my age, the ones I've met...well,
          I'm not that regular a person and
          they really like regular.

                    JULIAN

          Men your age may be really stupid,
          you ever think of that?
              (takes her hand)

                    ERICA

          Yes I have. Many times.

                    JULIAN

              (looks from her hand to
               her eyes)
          There's something radically wrong with
          the idea that no one loves you.
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
Julian kisses her palm, then her.

                    JULIAN

          I knew you'd smell good.

                    ERICA

          It's just...soap...

                    JULIAN

          How much is soap that smells like this?

                    ERICA

          I don't know. I got it at the market.

                    JULIAN

          Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

                    ERICA

          No, swear to God, I'm not...







MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED

Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.   He
leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
other evidence then hightails it out of there.







INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
way, then changes her mind and stops.




                                                        62.











                    ERICA

              (yells)
          I'm back...

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          You have fun?

                    ERICA

          It was interesting. So... Good night.







INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          'Night...







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER

Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?

W

 e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
She types: I think so...
He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

                    ERICA

              (to herself)
          How does he know everything!
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
I'm in my pjs.
He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.




                                                        63.










Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
than he has.
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
their pajamas.

                    HARRY

          We are cute...

                    ERICA

          This is pretty unusual for me.   I'm not
          used to having sleepovers.

                       HARRY

          Me either.

                    ERICA

          Really? With your social life?

                    HARRY

          My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
          Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.

                    ERICA

          Okay, good to know.
              (heading for the kitchen)
          So, what are you hungry for?

                    HARRY

              (joining her)
          What are my choices? I mean I know you
          think I'm not very discriminating but...
She looks through the fridge.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, what's the difference what I
          think. I can't imagine what you think of
          me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
          vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.

                       HARRY

          Pancakes.

                    ERICA

          Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?




                                                      64.











                    HARRY

          You ever miss being married? I bet you
          were great at it.

                    ERICA

          Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
          that much anymore. Was one of us just
          saying something interesting?

                    HARRY

          You said you can't imagine what I think
          of you.

                    ERICA

          Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
          that.

                    HARRY

          Okay.

                    ERICA

          I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
          curious but...'

                    HARRY

          will you tell me first why you only
          miss being married at night?

                    ERICA

              (cracking eggs)
          Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
          at night and the "alone" thing happens at
          night and sleeping by myself took some
          getting used to. But I got the hang of
          it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
          bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
          a side when no one has the other side.
She starts mixing the batter.

                    HARRY

          Okay, now I'm convinced what I
          think of you is right.
              (Erica waits. . . )
          You are a tower of strength.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Ughhhhhhhhhh... .

                    HARRY

          Try not to rate my answer.

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.




                                                        65.











                    HARRY

          You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
          mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
          like a great portrait over a fireplace.
          Words have been invented to describe
          women like you.

                    ERICA

              ( fearful)
          Such as?

                     HARRY

          Flinty   and...Impervious.

                    ERICA

          So you think I'm inhuman.

                    HARRY

          No. I think you're formidable.

                    ERICA

          But cold and distant. Like I'm
          frozen in some painting...

                    HARRY

          Not at all. I think you're strength
          defines you.
              (sees how sensitive she
               is)
          But it's thrilling when your defenses are
          down arid you're not isolated. That, I
          believe, is your winning combo. A killer
          combo actually.

                    ERICA

          ... So I can't decide if you hate me or if
          maybe you're the only person who ever got
          me.

                    HARRY

          I don't hate you.
The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and

HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.


                    ERICA

          Hello?
Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.

                    MARIN

          Room service!

                    ERICA

          What are you doing here at this hour?




                                                        66.










Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
down his hair. Erica catches all this.

                    MARIN

              (enters, kisses Erica)

          I

            had this big photography auction
          tonight, then I went out with a
          bunch of people, I checked my
          messages and got this so sad
          message from Harry so bored out
          here. I thought I should come out
          and at least see how he was doing.
              (kisses Harry on the
               cheek)
          Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
          by the way. They were so huge...
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
Harry notes Erica's reaction.

                    MARIN

          So how are you guys?
              (sets down the Zabar's
               bag)
          Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
          pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
          pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.

                    ERICA

          Don't be silly. You know I never
          sleep and this one doesn't sleep
          either. It's... .What's in the
          bag?

                    MARIN

              (reaches into the bag)
          A quart of matzoh ball soup for
          Harry. I know it's not the remedy
          for heart problems but it is low
          cholesterol.

                    ERICA

              (hating to correct her)
          But high sodium.

                    MARIN

          Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your
          favorite raisin-bread. And for
          me...
              (reaches into the bag)
          My favorite Vodka.
Marin's cell phone RINGS.




                                                          67.











                    MARIN

              (into phone)
          Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record
          time. Everyone's still there?
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
and tosses it in her purse.

                    ERICA

          So, Mar, now that you're here, why
          don't you finish the pancakes and
          I'll get back to work...

                    MARIN

          Mom! I just got here, hold on.
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.

                    MARIN

          So your ex-husband stood me up
          today. We were supposed to have
          lunch at Barneys . He never showed
          up. Was he always like this?

                    ERICA

          Honey, I don't know...

                    MARIN

          This is what happens after a couple
          gets divorced, the kid inherits all
          the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
              (then to Harry, the flirt
               in her coming back)
          So how are you, how do you feel?
          When can you go home?
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
bag.

                     ERICA

          I really am gonna do a little work.
          . . you two catch up. . . and just
          flip these Hin like two seconds.

                     ARRY

          You don't want pancakes anymore?

                    ERICA

          I, uh, I don't think I...I...
              (looks at Marin so)
          gorgeous, next to him
          No. I don't.




                                                        68.










Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
perfect it is.







INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY

Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.
Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking
cherries.

                    MARIN

          I'm breaking up with Harry.

                    ERICA

          Why? What do you mean?

                    MARIN

          'Cause I met someone else.

                    ERICA

          In the two days you've been gone?

                    MARIN

          You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
          thousand people everyday. Also, let's
          face it, the guy's insanely old for me.
          I'd be nuts to keep this going.

                    ERICA

          True, but you know he is....

                    MARIN

          -- I know. He's soulful when you
          don't expect it, right?

                    ERICA

          It's unnerving.

                    MARIN

          Now, Mom, if you could handle this,
          I was thinking... you and Harry...

                     ERICA

          I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to
          handle it.

                    MARIN

          But you're only saying that 'cause
          you think he and I have had sex.

                    ERICA

          Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?




                                                        69.











                    MARIN

              (whispering)
          Never even got close. Swear to God.
              (Erica digests this)
          Just puttin' that out there...'cause for
          two people who are convinced they got
          life beat, there's was somethin' cooking
          in the kitchen last night other than
          pancakes.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry
TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's
about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for
it and slips right Out Of Frame.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

              (into phone)
          Hello.







INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the

                     J

ER, on his CELL PHONE.

                     ULIAN

          I've waited a reasonable amount of hours
          before calling you, even though you've
          been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15.
          I'm wondering when we could have dinner
          again? I have to work the next few nights
          and if we wait 'til next week, I know
          you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I
          know it's like a date night but I think
          that's good.

                    ERICA

          Who is this?
Julian stops short.

                    ERICA

          I'm kidding!

                    JULIAN

          Can you meet me at The Grill at
          eight?

                    ERICA

          Okay. Yes. That's seems fine.




I














                                                          70.











                    JULIAN

          I look forward to, seeing you too.
Erica smiles to herself.







ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL

turning off the phone and grabbing his heart

 NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a
little dazed.

                    MARIN

          Okay, he's all yours.

                    ERICA

          Stop that. How'd he take it?

                    MARIN

          He just took care of it for me; He
          was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate
          was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
              (realizes something)
          He was breaking up with me. He's a
          genius.

                    ERICA

          That's impossible, he wouldn't...

                    MARIN

          It doesn't matter, we're done and
          we both feel good about it.
              (hugs her)
          I gotta get back.
              (as she exits)
          Now Erica, try to think of this as
          the smartest thing you've ever done
          for yourself.
Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.

                    ERICA

              (into the phone)
          Hello.

                    HARRY

          (from the beach)
          Thought you'd like to know your
          daughter broke up with me.
Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the
Kitchen Window.




                                                        71.











                     ERICA

          I heard.

                    HARRY

          Made up a story about meeting another
          guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in
          my arm.

                    ERICA

          No, I think she really did meet
          someone else.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's alright. Her mother
          didn't like me anyway.

                    ERICA

              (smiles)
          How 'bout I bring you out some
          lunch and a couple of blood

                    H

          pressure pills?

                     ARRY

          You're a great woman, Erica.
              (Erica relaxes)
          Is this why my doctor is falling in
          love with you?

THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a
picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams
with laughter.

BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
edge. They talk non-stop.

A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY

Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE

LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.


A MATCH IS STRUCK

and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
them has time to think, they kiss.




                                                        72.











                       ERICA

          I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

              (truly confused)
          For what?

                    ERICA

          I just kissed you.

                    HARRY

          No, honey, I kissed you.
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.

                    ERICA

          I know that one was me.

                    HARRY

          Try not to keep score.
He kisses her again and again.

                    HARRY

          Soft lips...

                    ERICA

          I'm so glad they still work.
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.

                    HARRY

          Well, well, now look who's got
something that works...
They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.

                    ERICA

          And you didn't even take Via-

                     HARRY

              (puts his finger on her
               lips)
          Kiss me before you make it go away.

S

 he kisses him long and sweet.

ERICA'S BED

They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
the sun goes down.




                                                        73.











                    HARRY

          This could be world class
          interesting.
              (Erica nods)
          Having any doubts?

                       ERICA

                 (as they kiss)
          Yes.

                       HARRY

          Me too.

                    ERICA

          But so far the kissing is
          spectacular.
              (He looks at her)
          I'm not grading you, just
          mentioning it. Brilliant.
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
to her.

                    HARRY

          Can't get past your damn
          turtleneck. . .
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.

                    ERICA

              (breathless)
          Cut it off... Please.
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.

                    HARRY

          You're beautiful.
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.

                    HARRY

          Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
              (she opens her eyes)
          Beautiful...
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.




                                                        74.











                    HARRY

          What about birth control?

                       ERICA

          Menopause.

                    HARRY

              (thrilled)
          Who's the lucky boy...
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
for her. Then:,

                    ERICA

          I think we should take your blood
          pressure.
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????

                    ERICA

          It's irresponsible not to.

H


 ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER

sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
his head...

                    HARRY

          Nobody but you would. . .

                    ERICA

          Yeah...so you're lucky.
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.

                    ERICA

              (ecstatic)
          One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!







THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION

hurdles recklessly into the air.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The rain is coming down in torrents.

INSIDE

We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the
side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...




                                                           75.














                    ERICA

          Oh my God, I do like sex.
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.

                    HARRY

          You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

                    ERICA

          Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
          do on a rainy afternoon...
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.

                    ERICA

          I really thought I was sorta closed for
          business. Just never expected this.

                     HARRY

              (nods)
          Nothin's ever surprised me more...
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

                    HARRY

          This is crazy. I can't remember the last
          time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.

                    ERICA

              (crying with him)
          Me too. That's the perfect word.

                    HARRY

          Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
          attack and I didn't die!
Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

                    HARRY

          That's gotta be some kind of record.
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.

                    ERICA

              (wiping her tears)
          Let's not brag about this to our
          doctor, okay?




                                                           76.











                    HARRY

          Honey I may not be many things but one -
          thing I am is a gentleman.
Harry holds her close.

                    HARRY

          Erica, Erica, Erica.
              (she turns to him)
          You know I'm not good at being
          monogamous, right?

                    ERICA

          Monogamous? Please, I hardly know
          you.
He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
kisses her.

LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS


C

 ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.

                    HARRY

          -- So there I was at nineteen, in New
          York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow
          before and I didn't have enough money for
          the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea
          how far it was and I'm talking blizzard
          and I'm in sneakers.

                    ERICA

          Awwwww,. . .

LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE

in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both
look around for it. Erica reaches for it on her desk.

                    ERICA

              (disoriented)
          Hello? I mean...Hello.
              (turns phone upside down)
          Hello.







INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING


                    MARIN

          Mom, you guys okay out there?

                    ERICA

          We're fine. Why? What's going on?




                                                        77.











                    MARIN

          What do you mean, it's like a
          hurricane. The news said the winds
          are like a zillion miles an hour.

                    ERICA

          Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...




                    MARIN

          Are you having sex? Tell the truth.
          You are, aren't you.

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No. That is not
          going on now.

                    MARIN

          Oh my God, you already did it. Was
          it amazing?

                    ERICA

          I have to go.

                    MARIN

          Just tell me, was it amazing?

                    ERICA

          Yes and thank you for the wonderful
          opportunity.
Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to
Harry, embarassed.

                    ERICA

              (to Harry)
          Am I interested in buying aluminum
          siding. . .

                    HARRY

          Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?
Erica buries her face in his chest.

LATER

Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking
wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles
light the room.

                    HARRY

          --But why Paris?

                    ERICA

          I just always wanted to write a play that
          ended there.




                                                        78.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          People need romance like that. And if
          someone like me doesn't write it, where
          they gonna get it? Real life?

                    HARRY

              (slightly insulted)
          Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating
          eggs by candlelight in our robes after...
She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her
back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed.

CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS


                    HARRY

          So where do you like to eat in
          Paris?    E

                     RICA

          Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar,
          it's just a little bistro on the Left
          Bank, best roast chicken in the universe.

                    HARRY

          You'd be fun to go to Paris with.

                     ERICA

          It's a great city to stay up all
          night in.
              (then)
          When's your birthday?

                      HARRY

          February.

                    ERICA

          Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we
          still know each other by then we go to
          Paris for our birthdays.

                     HARRY

              (a beat, then)
          Maybe. . .

                    ERICA

          Oh. Sorry. You just...
              (sees the look on his
              face) .
          I have no idea how to do this...be
          intimate but not...The color is draining
          from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna
          pee,take one of your blood pressure pills
          then when I get back, let's not talk
          anymore.




                                                          79.










She gets out of bed.

                    HARRY

          You're the funniest girl I ever had
          sex with.
She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.

                    ERICA

          That's somethin'...

                       HARRY

          Honey... ?
She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.

                    HARRY

          I think I'm gonna go back to my
          room...let you sleep.

                     ERICA

          Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually
          send the girls home. . .but I am home...
          so...okay.

                    HARRY

          I'm an old dog, you' know.

                    ERICA

          Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.
          Good night. This was..This was a
          great night. For me...

                    HARRY

          Me too. At one point I even thought
          soul mates, you know...
Erica nods. She knows.

HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED

stares straight up at the ceiling.

INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a
second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
the doorway.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to try sleeping with you.




I














                                                          80.










Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
Harry climbs in next to her we:

                                          FADE THRU TO:


EXT. HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.

HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME

 arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
full blast.
Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...

                    HARRY

              (grabs his watch, blinks)
          Can you see this?

                    ERICA

          Not really but it looks like it
          says eleven.

                    HARRY

              (slips on his glasses)
          It is eleven...

                    ERICA

          It can't be, that would mean we
          slept eight hours.

                    HARRY

          Impossible.
They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,
messy haired, a little wiped.

                    HARRY

          How ya doin' Ace?
              (she ,elts as he lies
               right back down)
          Whoa Nelly...little dizzy.

                    ERICA

          Okay, just stay still, here's the
          clicker. You know you have a
          doctor's appointmQnt in an hour.
              (getting out of bed)

              (MORE )





                                                        81.














                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          I'll make us some coffee, get you your
          pills, whip us up some french toast, I
          have ,the best maple syrup ever. '

                    HARRY

          Erica...
              (she turns)
          You are a woman to love.
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up
for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.

                    ERICA

          You are woman to love. What the
          hell does that mean?

AN EKG MACHINE

Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
buttoning up his shirt.

                    JULIAN

          Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These
          past few days have done wonders for you.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, I've been working on that stair
          thing. I can do it by the way.

                    J


                     ULIAN

          Do what?

                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
          actually.
Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.

                    JULIAN

          Way to go. How's Erica?

                    HARRY

              (caught)
          Erica?

                    JULIAN

          I know you must know her name by
          now.




                                                        82.














                    HARRY

          Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out
          is an amazing woman. Does whatever
          she can to make me happy. Really.
          Turns out she's very giving.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.

                    HARRY

          Very giving.

                    JULIAN

              (looking away)
          Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
          think she's wonderful.
A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high
road.

                    HARRY

          I think she's wonderful too.

                    JULIAN

              (gathering his things)
          Give her my best...

                    HARRY

          Julian. Thanks for everything.
Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.

                    JULIAN

          You're gonna be okay.

                    HARRY

              (touching his tears)
          What the...? This is the second
          time I've done this now. I get
          overcome or something. . .

                    JULIAN

          It's very common to become emotional
          after having an episode like you've had.
          Everything takes on a new meaning.

                    HARRY

              (wiping his tears)
          So it's not crazy for a man to do
          something entirely out of character
          after having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

              (handing him Kleenex)
          Like crying?




                                                        83.











                    HARRY

          Yeah and totally changing their
          tastes. Like suddenly really liking
          something they never thought they
          could like...ever...and I'm talking
          really liking it. It's...unnerving.

                    JULIAN

          I think you can expect just about
          anything right now. People have done some
          wild things after having a heart
          attack...selling businesses, getting
          divorced, moving... Some people say it
          saved their lives.

                    HARRY

          But most people go back to being
          themselves, right? I'll go back to
          being me, won't I?

                    J


                        ULIAN

          We'll see.







ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS

She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in
her life. She picks up the phone.

HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN.


                       HARRY

                 (on his cell)
          Hi.

                      ERICA

          Hey.    What'd he say?

                    HARRY

          He said you're wonderful.

                    ERICA

          No, really, what'd he say...How are you?

                    HARRY

          He said I'm good..that I can go.

                     . ERICA

              (obviously conflicted)
          Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really.
          . . great.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute
          sure. You think you can deal with me for
          one more night?




                                                        84.














A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT

Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething
sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest
people in the room, dancing with each other.

A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM

Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing
Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the
crowd enthusiastically applauds.

                    HARRY

              (big breath)
          Okay, here goes...

                    ERICA

          Here goes what?

                    HARRY

          Here goes me singing to you...
              (pulling a DISC out of his
               pocket)
          Bought my own music.

                    ERICA

          You knew they had karaoke?

                    HARRY

          Baby, it's why we're here. .
Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's
handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica.

                    HARRY

          This is for you, Ace...
              (then, under his breath)
          wish me luck.
The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of
Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To
          Give your heart a song to sing... And
          then a kiss, but more than this... I wish
H         you love...
 arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.

                    HARRY

          Don't want to blow this part...
Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .




                                                           85.











-.


                    HARRY

              (sings)
          Et en juillet une limonade...Pour
          vous refroidir dans quelque lefy
          glade...
And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has
just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues
singing, we:

                                         CUT TO:


LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY

Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters
doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong.

                    ERICA

              (holding some cigars)
          Here you go, you can have these back now.
              (Harry looks confused)
          I confiscated them your first night
          here...

                    HARRY

              (smells them)
          Thank you darlin' ...

                    ERICA

          Try not to smoke them...
              (hands him a small bag)
          And I packed you a sandwich, just
          in case your blood sugar got low.
          And some of that iced-tea you like,
          and a nonfat, low cholesterol
          cookie. And a peach.

                    HARRY

          what a doll...
              (notices)
          Got something else?
From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with
all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.

                    ERICA

          Something to remember me by.
Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him
and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her.




                                                          86.











                    HARRY

          There is that...

                    ERICA

          And hey, we'll always have Paris.

                    HARRY

          Honey, no words can ever express my
          gratitude for taking me in and taking care
          of me and...

                    ERICA

          Hey, your heart attack could be the best
          thing that ever happened to me.

                     HARRY

              (kisses her quickly, even
               faster throws out)
          I love ya.

                    ERICA

          I love you too...if that's what you said. I
          don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an
          official I love you but...
Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . .

                    HARRY

          You're not like anybody.

                    ERICA

          Neither are you.







INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE - DAY

Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been
calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the
house, until it is finally out of view.
Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an
Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back
in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.

INT. ERICA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - OVER, THE PHONE RINGS

The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.

                     E


                     RICA

          I knew you'd call.

MARIN - WALKING IN SOHO

on her cell phone, CRYING.




                                                          87.











                     MARIN

           Who? It's me.

INTERCUT


                     ERICA

           What's wrong?

                     MARIN

           I had breakfast with Dad this morning and
           we're talking and he starts looking all
           weir~ and then he tells me he met someone
           three weeks ago and it's "really
           something and then he
               (sobbing now)
           He tells me he's getting married. Why am
           I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty
           years old...
               (people stare at her)
           Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.

                     ERICA

           Who's he marrying?

                     MARIN

           I don't know. Some chick he met three
           weeks ago. She's four years older than me
           and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor.
           Has he lost his mind? I have a huge
           auction tonight... Why do I have to be
           the one to deal with this? Can you please
           come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~
           away for two weeks...I know you're
           working but. . .please. . ?

AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER

One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen
movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car
pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS   PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry
steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar. Lowell joins him
as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy
Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music.
LOWELL Good to be back?
HARRY Let's find out.

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER

Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her
car. She's on her cell.




                                                        88.











                    ERICA

          Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,    so you'll
          let Harry know I'll be. in the    city
          tonight and he can reach me on    my
          cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw    shit.
          Hello?

EXT. SOTHEBY'S AUCTION HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

A Crowd files in for tonight's auction.

INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a
proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening.

                     MARIN

          -- Look, I get that he has a right to get
          remarried, but he doesn't even know her
          and she's like my age. You know what
          that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And
          I know he's not replacing me so why does
          it feel like he is? This is crazy, right?
          Crying like this...

              (

                lights a cigarette)

                    ERICA

          Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me.
          And all the statistics say divorced men
          almost always remarry. That's just the
          way they're built.

                    MARIN

              (slipping on her dress)
          Mom, you want to know the answer to
          the big mystery of my life? Why I'm
          always with the wrong guy? This is
          why. Because the wrong guy can't do
          this to you. You have some control
          with the wrong guy. This thing I'm
          feeling right now. This is my big
          fear...that some guy could get me
          unglued like this, like nothing's
          connected. And this is just my
          father! I'm just not strong enough
          to handle this kind of drama.

                    ERICA

          The drama in life is what makes you
          strong.

                    MARIN

          No, it's what makes you strong.
          You've never really understood
          this,but we're not all like you.




                                                      89.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex
          husband, the man who I still allow to
          direct my plays.! was getting married to
          some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat
          Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you.
              (realizes)
          You've never looked better, by the way.
              (sinks)
          My anti-depressant is obviously not
          working. It should cover events like this
          shouldn't it?

                    ERICA

          Since when do you take an antidepressant?

                    MARIN

          Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who
          doesn't?

                       ERICA

          Yes. Me.

                    MARIN

          I rest my case.
A KNOCK on the door.

                    VOICE FROM OUTSIDE

          Marin, we're all set.

                    MARIN

          Mom, can you do one other really
          big thing for me? Just say yes.

                    ERICA

              (taking two Turns)
          Anything bubee.

                    MARIN

          Will you come out to dinner tonight
          with me and Dad and the fiance?

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No.

                    MARIN

          Please. He wants me to meet her and I can
          not go alone. I already asked him if you
          could come and he said it was fine and
          she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna
          have to meet her too, so, we might as
          well meet her together. Come on, you know
          you can handle it.




                                                        90.










Erica pauses, thinks M
                     about it. She knows she can too.

                      ARIN

           Okay. That's it. See that look on
           your face. That's the gene I didn't
           get.

INT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER

Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front
of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess.

                     MARIN

           Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and
           this evening's sale of Impressionistic
           and Modern Art. Bidders should know that
           the auctioneer may open bidding on any
           lot below the reserve by placing a bid on
           behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start
           with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And

           gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on
           the phone. . .

ON ERICA

in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She
slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up
and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.

A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30

We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone
is RINGING.

ANGLE - A CELL PHONE

as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:

INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT

Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,
tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches
the table.

                     JULIAN

           Guess I got stood up.

                     WAITER

           Would you like to order or...?




                                                        91.











                    JULIAN

          Why not, I put. on the tie and
          everything. And can you bring me
          another. . .
              (indicating his drink)
Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.

TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT

and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:

IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,
a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus
and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and
Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too
fast.                D

                     AVE

              (to Erica)
          Thirsty?

                    ERICA

          I've had a big week Dave, forgot how
          these slip right down. I'm fine. So,
          Kristen, where'd you go to...
              (burps)
          --medical school? Excuse me.

                    KRISTEN

          University of Pennsylvania.

                    ERICA

          I went to school in Philadelphia
          too.

                    DAVE

          Bryn Mawr girl.

                     KRISTEN

          That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn
          Mawr . . .

                    MARIN

          Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
          but our mothers went to the same college.
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.

                    MARIN

          Anyone mind?

                    KRISTEN

          Actually I do.




                                      92.











          MARIN

Okay, I'll just..have one.
    (lights up)
So, this isn't going badly so far
is it? I mean for a totally surreal
situation like this.

          DAVE

Shall we order?

          KRISTEN

Absolutely.

          DAVE

    (peruses menu)
Erica, do I like duck?

          ERICA

Yes. It's rabbit you hate.
    (to Kristen)
I'll give you a list of everything
he likes and dislikes.

          DAVE

Let's let her figure some things
out on her own.

          ERICA

I didn't mean those things, Dave.
She did go to medical school.

          MARIN

    (pointing to herself and
    Kristen)
Hey, not in front of the kids.

          ERICA

    (polishing off her
     Martini)
I will tell you this...Dave has one
truly great love in his life.

          KRISTEN

Really? What's that?

             ERICA

His balls.

          DAVE

Okay, I forgot to mention she can't
drink hard liquor.
    (to Marin)
Why did you order her a Martini?

                    ERICA

          What? It's not true? The man can not
          watch TV or read without the hand down
          the pants-- Here's my advice after 21
          years I say who cares, they're his
          balls,let him enjoy 'em.

                    MARIN

              (chokes)
          I think I swallowed my olive, whole.
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.

A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES

and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by
her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake
someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,
the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date
walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.

M


 OVING IN ON ERICA

as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is
seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date
facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to
act normal but apparently isn't.

                    MARIN

          Mom, you okay?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, fine.
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry
leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his
hand.

                     RICA

          You know what? Maybe I need a little
          air...
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as
she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a
glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now
stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.

                     HARRY

          Hey.

                    ERICA

          Hello... Harry.
              (to his Date)
          Hello...




                                                          94.











EXT. RESTAURANT

Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is
pounding. She heads down the street.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, I'm so stupid...
She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Hello?
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.

                    HARRY

              (walking quickly)
          Slow down. You want to kill me?
She considers it.

                    ERICA

          Harry, I gotta go...

                    HARRY

          Erica, she's just a friend.

                     ERICA

          Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
          of a girl.
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.
Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.

                    HARRY

          Come on, it's just a dinner...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, here's the problem. I
          really like you.

                    HARRY

          I really like you.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but I love you like you.
              (that stops him)
          I do. I love you.
Harry swoons and not in a good way.

                    HARRY

          I think maybe you should consider
          that you're in love with the idea
          of being in love.




                                             95.














          ERICA


D

 o you? Okay. Oh, God...
    (stomps her feet)
I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
    (tries not to cry in front
     of him)
I've never been the dumb girl
before. It ain't so great.

          HARRY

Let's just calm down. This was just
a a meal with a friend.

           ERICA

-- Did you know I called you seven
hours ago?

          HARRY

I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
all day, it's my first day back.

          ERICA

Uh-huh. . .

          HARRY

I had these plans before I met you. But I
do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
surprised by it.

          ERICA

What was I thinking?

          HARRY

Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
look what a good time we had. Let's not
ruin something great.

          ERICA

Harry, I won't be good at this.

           HARRY

At what?

          ERICA

Acting like I don't care.

          HARRY

I have never lied to you. I have always
told you some version of the truth.

          ERICA

    (freaking on that one)
The truth doesn't have versions.




                                            96.











          HARRY

Can you cut me a little slack? My
life's been turned upside down.

          ERICA

Yeah. Mine too.

          HARRY

Then let's each get our bearings.

          ERICA

I don't want my bearings. I've had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
something with you that... Oh, you don't
want to-

          HARRY

Yes I do.
    (she won't open up)
Tell me.

          ERICA

I felt something with you, I didn't know
really existed. You know what that's like
after a twenty year marriage? To feel
something for another person that's so
off the charts, that -
    (Harry looks down)
Okay, not your problem. This is why
I'm not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers,
those who can - do, those who can't
- write romantic comedies where
THIS does not happen in the third
act...and it certainly does not
happen to a 55 year old woman. In
the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
as pathetic. I'm just too old to
feel crushed.I've written this
feeling but I never really got it.
    (realizes)
You know what this is?
    (pointing to herself)
This is heart broken. How's that
for impervious?

          HARRY

You're killin' me.

          ERICA

I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.

          HARRY

Me too.




                                                      97.











                    ERICA

          That's a horrible thing to say.
              (walks off, comes back)
          The life I had before I met you. I
          knew how to do that, could do that
          forever. Now look at me...what do I
          do with all this?

                    HARRY

          Can we talk tomorrow?

                    ERICA

          What for? I saw your friend you were
          having dinner with, if that's what you
          want, it's never going to work with me.
          Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
          don't let this brown hair fool you, I
          don't have a real brown hair on my head,
          I'm almost all grey...that would freak
          you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
          cholesterol and my back hurts every
          morning and I'm post menopausal and I
          have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
          is just around the corner and I know
          you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
          it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
          lookin' for.
A TAXI pulls up.

                    ERICA

          And you know what? Everyday, I'm
          gettin' older. ..just like you.
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.

                      HARRY

          Wait.
Erica turns.
This is his chance.

                    HARRY

          I just... the truth is... I don't
          know how to be a boyfriend.

                     ERICA

          That's what you have to say after all
          this? You don't know how to be a
          boyfriend.

                    HARRY

          That's not a small thing.
They're both out of words.




                                                           98.











                    ERICA

          Are we done?

                    HARRY

          I don't know.
She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.

                    HARRY

              (winces)
          Ouch.
He grabs his heart.

                       HARRY

          Oh, God...







HARRY - ON A GURNEY

wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.
This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with
patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her
thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's
immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an

IV.


                    NURSE

          Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest
          pain, no nauseau, some shortness of
          breath, was hospitalized a week ago
          with a coronary thrombosis.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Hang a nitro drip.

                    HARRY

          You can't. I took Viagra.

                    DR. MARTIINEZ

          You have been through this before.
          Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You
          h~ving chest pain right now?

                    H


                     ARRY

          No, and the pain I was having was
          sharp, not like before.

                    . DR. MARTINEZ

          That's good. Not like before is we
          like to hear.
              (reads EKG)
          Give him aspirin.




                                                        99.











                      DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)

          Based   on what I see so far, your
          heart   is not in distress but I'm
          gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be
          sure.    What were you doing at the
          onset   of the pain?

                    HARRY

          Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can
          a woman give you chest pain?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
          heard?

                    HARRY

          Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I
          never got any.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

              (confused at how literal
               he is)
          All right, well you're battin' a thousand
          here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
          EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
          like the kind of pain we worry about. I
          think what you experienced was normal
          chest pain associated with stress.

                      HARRY

          Stress?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          And incase you haven't heard, that can
          give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I
          donlt know what you're up to gallivanting
          out and about at this hour, but if you
          were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,
          in bed, recuperating.

INT. HARRY'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his
Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,
takes out his cell.

                    HARRY

          If you were my Dad...
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,
they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and
dials.




                                                         100.











                    ERICA'S VOICE

          Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so
          leave a message.
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks
at her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (grabbing his chest)
          Ouch.

BLACK SCREEN




A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,
excited.             J

                     ULIAN'S VOICE

          Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about
          8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just
          Wondering if you're...
Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.

ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.

MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE


ERICA

wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.
While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an
INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.
He writes: Do I hear French Music?
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.




H














                                                         101.











INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's
glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. A
thermometer is propped in his mouth.
He writes: R U there?
She answers: Yes. Hello.
He writes: How are ya?
She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve.
 e writes:How's the writing going?
She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.

E

He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending.
 rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over.
Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out.
Take care...
Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2.
Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.

INT. HARRY' S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry takes out his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the
clock. It's 10:00 p.m.

INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Lowell lies in bed in pj's, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry
arrives at his doorway in his pajamas. Lowell puts out his
cigarette, fans the smoke.

                    HARRY

          Lowell, I'm goin' out.

                    LOWELL

              (confused)
          Okay. Don't forget to put some
          clothes on.

                    HARRY

          I mean, I should go out, shouldn't I?
          Since .when don't I go out? Just cause
          some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to
          stay in bed, doesn't mean I have to turn
          into a monk.




                                                       102.











                    LOWELL

          Is there something you'd like me to
          do for you, Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          Well, no, just...well, what are you
          doin'?

                    LOWELL

          Watching Lucy.

                    HARRY

          Would you hate making me something
          to eat?

CLOSE - LUCY AND ETHEL ON TV


REVERSE - HARRY AND LOWELL

lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating
bowls of pasta, watching TV.

                    HARRY

          Funny women are adorable, don't you
          think?

                    LOWELL

          I never really thought about it.

                    HARRY

          Neither had I, but think about it.
          Funny's a unique thing in a woman. It's
          fun to be around.

                    LOWELL

          There's some reason we've been
          watching these two for 5O years.

                    HARRY

          Exactly. It lasts. We're not
          sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van
          Doren reruns.

                    LOWELL

          No we're not. You feeling okay?

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've slept one night
          since I've been home. Every little
          ache and pain scares the shitout of
          me...can't get a handle on my
          emotional life, don't know what I
          want, don't know if what I felt was
          because I just had a heart attack
          or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I
          never used that word in my life.




                                                       103.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          Lowell, have you ever seen me like
          this? Be honest.

                    LOWELL

          Nothing even close.

                    HARRY

          That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.
          And I'm no good at it.
              (realizes something)
          Those are very nice pajamas, by the
          way. Did they used to be mine?

                    LOWELL

          Yes but you gave them to me, you
          said you never wore them.

                    HARRY

          I know. But why would I do that?
          They're so elegant. Nice piping...

                    LOWELL

          Mr. Langer, you're always giving
          away beautiful things.

                    HARRY

          Awwwww... How did I get like this?
              (eyes fluttering shut)
          I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few
          minutes. Keep Lucy on...
Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT.

EXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks
up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the
stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the
stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND

frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,
shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes.

EXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK

Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of
the stairs, watching the sunset.

                    MARIN

          Mom, we're going into town...
Erica turns, wiping tears.




                                      104.











          MARIN

Are you crying?
    (joining her)
I didn't know you did that.

          ERICA

Yeah, it's my new thing. I've
gotten abnormally great at it.

          MARIN

    (sitting on the step with
    her)
Is it Harry?

          ERICA

Seems I gotta learn how to do that
love 'em and leave 'em stuff.

          MARIN

Fucking men. You don't care when I
say fuck, do you?

          ERICA

Not really. Sometimes. Not right
now.

          MARIN

So now you get my theory about
love? You gotta self protect. It's
too dangerous.

          ERICA

Marin, that theory... how can I put
this so your feelings won't get
hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes
me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

          MARIN

And how would you put it if you
wanted to hurt my feelings?

          ERICA

Listen to me... you cannot hide
from love for the rest of your life
because maybe it won't work out and
maybe you'll become unglued. That's
not a way to live.

          MARIN

So you're telling me you're happy
right now? This is good what
happened to you?




                                                       105.











                    ERICA

          No. This was bad. But for the three days
          it was good, it was electrifying.
Marin's eyes fill up.

                    ERICA

          I think you must consider the possibility
          that we are more alike than you realize.
          I let someone in and I had the time of my
          life.

                    MARIN

              (tearful)
          I've never had the time of my life.

                    ERICA

          I know. And bubbee, I say this from
          the deepest part of my heart. . ...
          what the fuck are you waiting "for?

INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT

A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with
characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his
crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard
as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to
be.

                    LOWELL

              (as Harry passes)

          H

           aving fun?

                       HARRY

          Not quite.
Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded
entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the
QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside.

EXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY

Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way.
He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't
remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see,
wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right
back at her, his face full of hope.

INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.

                    ZOE

          I got you something great at the
          farm stand.




J














                                                       106.










Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet
of fresh cut flowers.

                    JULIAN

          These are for you to give me when
          you apologize.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a
home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,
their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth
as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,
leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.

                    ERICA

          Julian, I hope you know I'm
          mortified by my behavior. I was
          going to get in touch with you,
          send you a note or something...

                    JULIAN

          A note? That's a little chilly.

                    ERICA

          I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
          been myself lately. What can I say?

                    JULIAN

          Just tell me you're sorry.

                    ERICA

          I am sorry.

                    JULIAN

          Then you could kiss me.

                       ERICA

          Kiss you?
 ulian nods.

                    ERICA

          You'll forgive me if I kiss' you?

                       JULIAN

          Think so.
Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss.




                                                         107.











                    JULIAN

          No one on earth would forgive you
          for that kiss
              (places his wine glass on
               the counter)
          May I?
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a
kiss that doesn't quit.

                    JULIAN

              (still holding her,
              whispers)
          I forgive you.
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own
heart.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:


ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

                    JULIAN

          It's the best thing you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          It is?

                    JULIAN

          It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.
          It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

                    JULIAN

          How great is it that I'm not
          intimidated by your brilliance?
Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation.




                                                       108.











                    JULIAN

          Must we go through this every time?
          Come here...
She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly. She
holds onto the sofa for support.

                                                   CUT TO:


A PRETTY GIRL - WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARIN

eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop.

                    PRETTY GIRL

          I'm totally excited about this audition.
          It's such a great part. It's supporting
          but she's a really funny character.
          There's this totally hilarious scene
          where she's dating this like chauvinist
          older guy and just as they're about to do
          it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
          just really into her, right? Except he's
          having a heart attack and she's like
          creeped out and her mother, who basically
          despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
          CPR and saves his life.







REVERSE ON HARRY

choking on his lunch.

INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

Auditions are in progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the

                     A

part of "The Sister".

                     CTRESS

          Look, we're four sophisticated people.
          Why can't we all stay for the weekend?

ON ERICA'S PROFILE

in the audience. She sits in a row by herself, listening.
Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly behind her.

                    HARRY

          I need to talk to you.
Erica freezes, horrified. Turns, sees him.

                    HARRY

          Got a minute?




                                                       109.











BACKSTAGE

Erica and Harry stand in front of a BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.

                      HARRY

            So your play's about us?

                      ERICA

            No, it's about me.

                      HARRY

            Am I in it?

                      ERICA

            A guy like you is in it but he's
            not you.

                      HARRY

            What happens to this guy who's
            ..not me?

                      ERICA

            Haven't totally decided. He can
            live or he can die.

                      HARRY

            What are you leaning towards?

                      ERICA

            Death.
                (Harry reacts)
            It's funnier.

                      HARRY

            He dies of a funny heart attack?

                      ERICA

            He's sort of a schmuck who screwed
            around with our heroine, so it
            won't be too sad.

                      HARRY

            Schmucks are people too you know. Death
            doesn't seem a little harsh?

                      ERICA

            I just went where the story took
            me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.
            Really...just stuff I made up.

                      STAGE MANAGER

                (approaching)
            Erica, we're ready to do the
            hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra
            scene... Should we wait for you?




                                                       110.










Erica nods, horrified.

                    HARRY

          So I'm going to be the laughing stock of
          Broadway.

                    ERICA

          Harry, he's not you. He's a version
          of the truth of you. So to speak.

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
          to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
          you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
          right?

                    ERICA

          Right.
We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout
the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER
BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the
music, but it's impossible.

                     E


                     RICA

          Well, you look really nice. You
          feeling all right?
As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW
FALLS from above...

                    HARRY

          You know it isn't like I wanted to stop
          seeing you. We could've carried on a fun
          thing for awhile. Why is it you dames
          want all or nothing?

                    ERICA

          I don't know, we're just goofy when it
          comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all
          right with you, I'd like to be friends

                    HARRY

          I'm not ready to be your friend. How's
          that?

                    ERICA

          Fine. I understand.

                    HARRY

          Anyway, do you actually buy that horse
          shit.. .that men and women can be friends
          once they've had sex?




                                            111.











          ERICA

I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn't just have sex.

          HARRY

We didn't just have sex either.

          ERICA

Then what was it? Love to know.

           HARRY

Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
out?
     (laughs)
This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
think I invented the 'Can't We Be
Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
get why they never went for it. You dames
got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
change everything. Call me crazy, but I
just don't see us out on the town, being
pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
anything, at some point, one of us will
have very unfriend like thoughts about
the other then pass the bread becomes
anything but pass the bread. You get what
I'm saying?

          ERICA

You don't want to be friends.

          HARRY

Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
Doesn't work that way.
    (tries to calm down)
Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
this thing. I'm mad at you.
    (realizes)
It almost feels good.

          ERICA

I think I'm mad at you too.

          HARRY

Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
thinking about you so much and
worrying about how you are and if I
ruined your life or...

          ERICA

-- You've worried about me?

          HARRY

Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
die, worries about you.




                                                       112.

                    HARRY(cont'd)
          Sometimes worrying about you feels like a
          full time job.

                    ERICA

          Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't
          have to work that shift anymore.
Again, The Stage Manager...

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Erica, they want you to take a look at
          the costumes for the dancing Henry's.
          These gonna work for you?
Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR

OLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS.


EXT. THEATER - DAY

Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is
almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace
starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER
at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,
out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.
                     to

                     ARRY

          God is a woman, I know that now. No
          man would punish me like this.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You never change, do you?
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.

                    HARRY

          Do you know me or are you just talking to
          me as "man" in general, the beast women
          love to hate.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No, no, I know you Harry.

                    HARRY

          Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.
              (the Woman laughs)
          Right? I broke her heart then she married
          some hard working Joe on the rebound, has
          three great kids. What is so funny?




                                                       113.











                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You dated me and you broke my heart but
          after you I met the right guy. I've been
          married thirty-seven years, have four
          kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the
          way.
Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.

                    HARRY

          I dated you. .?
              (the Woman nods)
          Did we. ever...?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No...we did not.
He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.

                    HARRY

          Can you give me hint? A year? A
          decade?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          The sixties.
              (Harry squints at her)
          You took me to Shea Stadium.

                     HARRY

          To a Mets game?    I must've really
          liked you.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You took me to see The Beatles.

                    HARRY

          Oh, God, I really liked you. You're
          Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The
          Beatles together. How the hell have
          you been? What happened to you?

                    SANDRA

          Well, let's see, after we stopped
          going out, I went back to school,
          got my doctorate in marine biology,
          went around the world a few times,
          met the man of my dreams at Oxford,
          married him, we lived in London for
          25 years. I wrote and taught, we
          raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've
          just finished my ninth book and now
          I'm training for my first marathon.
          Now, I must confess, I actually
          remember the very last thing you
          ever said to me.




                                                       114.

                    SANDRA(cont'd)
          You walked me to my door, I was
          tearful and you looked at me with
          those puppy dog eyes and said,
          "Honey, I just don't know how to be
          a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what
          have you been up to since 1964?
OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez
runs along with the gurney.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer... Back so soon.

                    HARRY

          This is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20
          minutes of severe chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.
              (sticks out his arm)
          Give me the nitrate, I didn't take
          viagra.
              (rips open his shirt)
          Plug me in to the EKG, I need an
          aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta
          blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor,
          Procardia and if I were you, I'd be
          pounding my chest. Ow!

                    MALE NURSE

          You're a doctor, huh?

                    HARRY

          Just a very sick man.

CLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG

Dr. Martinez reads it.

                     DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although
          fascinating, was entirely
          incorrect.

                    HARRY

          That's impossible.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Your realize a severe anxiety attack can
          masquerade as a heart attack.

                    HARRY

          So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing
          I'm not taking pills for.




                                                          115.











                    DR. MARTINEZ

          If you don't want ,to end up in here
          every week, I suggest you do whatever it
          takes to decompress. Try something with
          me, okay?
              (takes his pulse)
          Close your eyes...now give yourself a
          visual image of something that gives you
          a feeling of peace and serenity.

                    HARRY

          I don't know. A hammock...

                    DR. MATINEZ

          Okay, good...what else..?

                    HARRY

          Palm trees...clear blue water...
We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Anybody there with you?

                    HARRY

          Yes. Beautiful women...in thongs...

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          (disgusted) Okay. What else do you
          see, feel, taste...

                    HARRY

          A margarita...a Cuban cigar.
          ..miles of soft beach.. .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Keep going...you're doing great...
And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as
the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:


THE WORDS. . .


                    SIX MONTHS LATER


FALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME

Boom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on
Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and
a banner that brags, "Sold Out!".

C




 AMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by,
bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME.




                                                       116.










He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:
And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in
front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He
SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting
"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing
Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A
PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry
OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,
hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience
breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an
apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his
throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks
relaxed and happy to see him.

                    MARIN

          I couldn't believe you were calling from
          downstairs.
              (hugs him)
          So great to see you.

                    HARRY

          You couldn't look better.

                    MARIN

          Thank you. Come on in.

                    HARRY

          No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say
          hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did
          anything to you that wasn't on the up and
          up or...

                    MARIN

          What do you mean? You were great to me.

                    HARRY

          I was?

                    MARIN

          Always.

                    HARRY

          That's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't
          know what you've done to yourself but you
          look absolutely radiant.

                    MARIN

          I'm three months pregnant, that might
          have something to do with it.




                                                       117.











                    HARRY,

          Really? Who's ..the, lucky guy?

                    MARIN

          My husband, hold on, he really wants to
          meet you.
              (calls)
          Danny...
A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie,
glasses...

                    MARIN

          Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.

                    DANNY

              (shaking Harry's hand)
          I've heard so much about you...

                      HARRY

          I bet.. .

                     DANNY

          Yeah, with Hthe play and all...

                     ARRY

          I'm famous,huh?

                    MARIN

          Just to us. In every interview my
          Mom does, she always says she made
          you up.

                    HARRY

          So the guy in the play, he doesn't
          make it, does he?

                    DANNY

          He basically dies at the end of the
          second act, but it's very funny.
              (as if that's some
              consolation)

                    HARRY

          Was hopin' she'd give me a
          reprieve, but...

                    MARIN

          Yeah, well...

                    HARRY

          Yeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids...
Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the
elevator, pushes the button, then turns back.




                                                          118.











                    HARRY

          How is she?

                     MARIN

          She's. . .
              (Harry waits)
          Really good.     Up to her old
          tricks.
Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city.

                    HARRY

          Now if I wanted to see her...how
          would that go over?

                    MARIN

              (encouragingly)
          Only one way to find out, except
          she's out of town right now.

                    HARRY

          Oh yeah? Where is she?

                    MARIN

          Paris. She left two days ago, for
          her birthday. But she'll be back
          next week...
The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA.

                       HARRY

          Paris...

ANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS

And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere
coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator
and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE
STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT
NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high
into the night sky directly behind him.

                       HARRY

          Showtirne.

INT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT

Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking
a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her
drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around
the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make
sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her.
Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come
up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.




                                                       119.











                    HARRY

              (proud of himself)
          I knew you'd be here.

                      ERICA

          You did?

                    HARRY

          I've come a long way to see you,
          Erica.

                    ERICA

          You mean we're not bumping into
          each other..? You came here to see
          me?

                    HARRY

          Yes, I did.
              (she seems to shiver)
          I'm aware it was a bold move, one
          of those impulses that grabs you,'
          but...so far, we're okay; right?

                    ERICA

          Well, uh, I mean, I'm just...

                    HARRY

          I'll take that as a 'Yes'.
Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.

                     ERICA

          You want a glass of wine or
          something?

                    HARRY

          I was just gonna give you a kiss
          hello.

                      ERICA

          Oh, Okay.
Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her
chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from
her. She looks at him - utterly speechless.

                    HARRY

          I remember you said if we still
          know each other we should go to
          Paris for our birthdays, well, we
          still know each other..".

                    ERICA

          That's true, but, Harry, I haven't
          heard from you in six months.




                                                         120.











                    HARRY

          I know but I've certainly been thinking
          about you. There's a lot I have to say.
          First thing is... I'm not mad at you
          anymore.

                    ERICA

          Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you
          anymore either.

                    HARRY

          That's a relief...since I did come all
          the way to France and everything. And...
          Happy Birthday.

                     ERICA

              (afraid of everything he
              could possibly say)
          Thank you.

                     HARRY

          And congratulations on your amazing
          success...

                    ERICA

          It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
          maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.
          Where've you been?

                    HARRY

          After I saw you in the theater that
          afternoon, I had another "episode...

                    ERICA

          Oh, I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

          I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
          dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed
          to decompress. So I did. I walked out of
          there and changed my life, sold most of my
          businesses, packed my bags and moved to an
          island in the Caribbean.

                    E


                     RICA

          That's where you've been all this
          time? In the Caribbean?

                    HARRY

          Actually...No.







EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK

Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian
shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.




                                                          121.











                    ,


                    HARRY (V.O.

          I was there about ,six hours, when it
          occurred to me that wasting away on an
          island in the Caribbean wasn't going to
          remotely cure what was ailing me.
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.

BLACK SCREEN

A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          So I decided to take another kind of
          pilgrimage...into my past.
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
          and visited all the women I've dated...
He blows dust off of the books.

                                         BACK IN PARIS


                    HARRY

          -- maybe I could figure out how I
          got so screwed up.

FLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE

Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE

SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          A lot of the women wouldn't see me.
Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Or speak to me.
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          But I was on a mission to save my
          soul.

                     ,

A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries.




                                                          122.










Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My losing streak finally ended when
          I got one to open up to me.
In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,
"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers
his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.
It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last
note: "Now, scram."

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Hearing what they had to say was no
          picnic.
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.
Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him.

                     H


                     ARRY (V .O.)

          But I stuck it out and I listened.
          Then I listened harder.
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          And one of the things I realized
          was, I was actually giving closure
          to generations of women.
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          Although I admit, some refused to
          give, no matter what I did. . .

CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER

On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE
RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him
straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.




                                                       123.











HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT


                    HARRY (V. O. )

          When you hear the same story about
          yourself over and over, your life
          begins to make sense and the future
          becomes your only salvation.







INT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT


                    HARRY

          It took me six months to find them
          all. I visited 18 different states
          but I came the furthest to see you.
A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:

                    A MAN'S VOICE

          I don't believe it.
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..

                       HARRY

          Me either.
Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next
to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.

                    ERICA

          I should have told you he was coming, but
          I was so engrossed in your story.

                    JULIAN

          What story..?

                     HARRY

          Oh, maybe another time. ..So...
              (looks from Erica to
               Julian, it all dawns on
               him)
          I guess I should've seen your play, then
          I would've Jknown how this ended.

                     ULIAN

          Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are
          you doing over here, man?

                    HARRY

          Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris
          in January...

                     JULIAN

          It's amazing to run into you. You look
          wonderful.




                                                          124.











                    ERICA

          You do.

                    HARRY

          Haven't been on a gurney in six months so
          that's somethin'...

                    JULIAN

          Well, I've just been to every store
          in the city, this woman is
          impossible to buy for... But I
          think I finally found the right
          gift.
He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between
Erica and Harry.

                    JULIAN

          Happy Birthday baby.
He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.

                    ERICA

              (reaching for it)
          I'll open it later...
Harry rises, reaches for his coat.

                    HARRY

          No, no, you know what, I'll let you
          two celebrate...

                    ERICA

          Harry, stay.

                    HARRY

          I can't really.

                    JULIAN

          Why? You have somewhere to go?

                                           DISSOLVE TO:


THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE

Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing
the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying
to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally
faking it.

THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER


                    JULIAN

          -- To the forces of destiny that
          brought us together tonight.




                                                       125.










Erica lights a cigarette.

                    JULIAN

          What are you doing, you don't
          smoke?

                    ERICA

          I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke
          will kill you anyway...

                    JULIAN

          She's very brilliant, but the woman
          can not hold her liquor.
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.

                    ERICA

          I like that about me.

                    BOTH GUYS

          Me too.
The Guys exchange looks.

                    ERICA

          Now, if I were writing this, this
          is where I'd write, 'an awkward
          moment' .

                    HARRY

          Honey, if you were writing this,
          I'd be dead.
Erica laughs.

                    HARRY

          Never fails to amuse her.
The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, Harry, please, let us...

                    HARRY

          No, no, I insist. I crashed your
          party.
              (to Erica)
          At least let me buy you dinner on
          your birthday...
              (squints at his watch
               shows it to Erica)
          What time does that say?

                    ERICA

              (squints)
          I have no idea...




                                                       126.











                    HARRY

              (feels around)
          Wait,' I have my. . .

                    ERICA

              (reaching into her purse)
          Me too...
They each take out EACH OTHER'S GLASSES and put them on.
Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.

                    HARRY

          You think you look so handsome in
          mine?

                     ERICA

          You know how long I've been looking
          for those?

                      HARRY

          Yes I do.
Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,
gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.

                     H


                     ARRY

              (tucking away his glasses)
          Once again...closure.
              (reads his watch)
          So it's only 5 in the afternoon in
          New York. What do they do around
          here for fun?







INT. NOISY CLUB - NIGHT

Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The
place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking
champagne. The air is strained.

                    BOTH GUYS

              (at the same time)
          Want to dance?
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian
takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry
watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry
waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's
comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry
and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.

ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR

Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.




                                                       127.











ANGLE - THE TABLE

Harry is gone.

EXT. STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.

                    HARRY

              (laughs at himself)
          At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
          but a sap, a stupid old sap,
          standing on a bridge in Paris,
          crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

                    HARRY

              (almost amused)
          Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

                    HARRY

              (looking toward heaven)
          Anything else... .

                      ERICA'S VOICE

          Harry?
Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor
running, snow falling on her hair and coat.

                    HARRY

          Where's Julian?

                    ERICA

          He went back to the hotel.

                      HARRY

          How come?




                                                       128.











                    ERICA

              (walking to him)
          He said when he saw me with you, he
          knew I was still in love with you.
          What do you have to say about that?

                    HARRY

          If it's true, my life just got
          made.

                    ERICA

          Why'd you come here, Harry?

                    HARRY

          Because I realized what I was feeling for
          you, have always felt for you, was
          something I didn't understand, like a
          language I didn't speak...
              (she listens...)
          It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck
          away. Turns out the heart attack was easy
          to get over. You were somethin' else.
              (she's starting to melt)
          And when I went to see all those women, I
          found out I was never really present for
          any of them. And something inside me at
          some point, had just...shut off. That's
          when I think my heart gave out and you
          saved me. I finally get what it's all
          about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love
          for the first time in my life. And that's
          what I came here to say.

                    ERICA

          Okay, this is the best birthday ever.

                     HARRY

          I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I
          only got another 30-40 years in me. Tops.
          But how 'bout we figure out a way to make
          this work.

                    ERICA

          Okay.

                    HARRY

          Okay? Okay! I'll take it.
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping
out of it's tinny speakers.

                    HARRY

          Honey, they're playing our song.




                                                         129.










She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great. And
as they separate, he smiles, relieved.

the crowded restaurant. The Baby fusses and reaches out to
Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her
through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
the room. Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits

                            SHOOTING DRAFT





    FADE IN:


1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1

    A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's
    back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.
    LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words
    you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
    specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is
    hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the
    first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red
    fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes
    beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part
    massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb
    probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his
    ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
    and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
    another trip down his upper body...
    MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles
    with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
    minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
    rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting
    tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The
    unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a
    single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand
    complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as
    TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,
    goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says
    something in Spanish...important for us because it will
    establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
    understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She
    replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty
    laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells
    her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and
    resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and
    grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view
    for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular
    anger, "you said you would never push me around again. If you
    do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
    back as high as you want." (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will
    be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
    speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)
    For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.
    Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
    argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.
    This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord
    and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of
    their marriage.

2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2

    Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
    bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
    We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
    up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,




                                                             2.







    "Cristina." When the man protests her stopping she indicates
    they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
    off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....

3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3

    As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
    step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
    digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
    which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the
    bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
    voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.

                        NARRATOR

              To Princeton University's Director
              of Admissions: In considering me
              for a scholarship you have asked
              for, and have every reason to
              expect, an essay from me about
              myself. And, as a clever high
              school graduate, I of course
              realize the subtext of this essay
              about who I am and why I want to
              enter Princeton, is actually to
              make clear to you why you should
              have me. I have gotten tips, from
              friends who have preceded me to
              college, that being a Latina, with
              my grades, list of activities and
              relative poverty, I am as good as
              in if I simply do the dance and
              work in a word like
              "bipolarization" every so often.
              And while I love dances -- this
              dance of self is one I am afraid to
              master.
                  (young girl looks off and
                   lights up)
              I prefer to write about my mother.

4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4

    A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
    getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
    attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
    father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
    when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
    from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
    now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
    she does not see what is transpiring.

                        NARRATOR

              For my mother, that afternoon
              eleven years ago was a watershed
              not because of my father's

              imprisonment but because it was my
              first day at school....

5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5

    This room is directly across from the husband's room. The
    woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
    the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.
    The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman
    is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman
    grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The
    undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her
    voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
    her daughter.

                        NARRATOR

              There was never any pretense that
              the gorgeous, vital, clever,
              temperamental animal that was my
              mother ever for a heartbeat
              considered having any life of her
              own. She ignored all her needs and
              was alive only for me. It was
              terrific.
                  (a long beat)
              At the time.

    ON MOM.

    As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter
    begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
    glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the
    action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the
    window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
    to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a
    shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her
    daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is
    an impressive charade.

    FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.

    And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,
    she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the
    shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned
    today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.
    Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
    toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter
    starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing
    the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.

6   INT. / EXT. KITCHEN - ON GIRL.                                6

    Standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.

    CLOSE UP GIRL.





                                                                 4.







    As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.

                           GIRL

                 Hi.
    The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
    though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
    back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
    perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
    just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
    father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
    starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
    about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
    will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
    pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
    Spanish.

                           MOTHER

                 Una lágrima...sola una sola...Haz
                 la mejor possible.

                           NARRATOR

                 "One tear..only one...so make it a
                 good one." This was my mother's
                 instruction to me.

    ON CHILD.

    Baffled by the edict..

    ON MOTHER.

    Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.

    ON CHILD..

    As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
    mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
    tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
    resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
    head...the eyes clear.

7   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     7

    As the mother, lying in bed with her daughter loses her own
    fight with tears..managing with difficulty to keep her
    convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are
    intertwined like pretzels.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


8   INT. GIRL'S ROOM - DAY                                            8

    The girl works on her lesson plan..She is a study in beauty.
    Her mother's daughter. Across the small hallway her mother
    greets and deals with friends and family in a:




                                                                 5.








9    SERIES OF SHOTS                                                  9

     As the girl works..her dress changing as the days change
     while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the
     hall.

                         NARRATOR

               My mother dealt with our
               considerable problems of survival
               by talking..Always she discovered
               her own best thoughts by sifting
               through her own words.
     The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has
     just solved something and makes a note.

10   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - THE TWO OF THEM IN BED - NIGHT       10


                         NARRATOR

               Each night my mother promised me a
               wonderful life.. Each night I
               looked for a new expressive way to
               tell my mother how much I loved
               her.
     The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her
     mother.. Holding her mother's face, talking directly into her
     eyes. The mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown
     by the extremes of it.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               I just played and did my lessons
               and every time I looked up my
               mother was in the process of saving
               us.

11   INT. / EXT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS                          11

     Her mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and
     relatives bringing food, clothing - toys.

                         NARRATOR

               Desperation in her hands was our
               weapon.

     ON MOTHER..

     We see her totally intimidating a priest.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               With this weapon she had her
               marriage annulled - usually
               impossible for the poor - and
               somehow convinced an associate of
               my father's to transport two
               Mexicans North in style.




                                                              6.








12   INT. SMALL AIRPLANE - MAGIC HOUR                             12

     The mother and daughter seating themselves. The mother is
     enormously nervous with the prospect of flight. She sits,
     the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap,
     mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug.

                         AMERICAN PILOT

                   (to girl)
               How you doing?

                         GIRL

                   (accented English)
               Hi. How are you? I am fine..
                   (she checks her book of
                    English synonyms)
               ..happy, merry, joyful, glad,
               contented, frisky.
     As they taxi.

                         AMERICAN PILOT

                   (to mother)
               Are you her mother, sister..what?
     The mother says, "solo español"---"only Spanish." The
     daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent
     flight. Her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for
     their safety.. As the plane continues to taxi...We HEAR the
     mother's prayer in Spanish. She then nudges her
     daughter..who, with this gentlest of prods, repeats the same
     prayer.

13   EXT. AERIAL SHOT..                                           13

     The plane crossing the Rio Grande.

                         NARRATOR

               My mother's prayer for us, which
               she made me repeat exactly,
               represented a stunning look into
               our future. "Please God, let only
               the bad things change."

14   INT. SMALL PLANE - CLOSE ON THE TWO FEMALES..                14

     Use this image if ever you want to strike a coin depicting
     the moment of no return. The child aglow with happy
     anticipation..the adult brave and enormously anxious.

     OTHER ANGLE.

     The pilot taken with the mother's looks.

               How can I reach you? Address?
               Telephone? Por favor. Por favor.

     He glances over..this is not lechery, it is art
     appreciation..an errant but decent man awed by the creature
     he is drawn to..

                            NARRATOR

                  My mother had redefined her own
                  passions. Blaming herself for the
                  father she gave me, she would never
                  again be lured by a man's rough
                  edges..She had decided that
                  goodness would be her catnip.

     ON MOTHER..

     As she feels him looking at her and turns. With some
     affection and regret, she shakes her head, "no."

     THE PILOT.

     As he mouths the word "ouch."

15   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT...                                        15

     Plane landing on a dirt and grass strip...

16   EXT. FIELD - LATER - NIGHT - ON MOTHER AND DAUGHTER..        16

     Standing on the tarmac..Latin flavored music suddenly gives
     way to a Texas country harmonica riff..The child tries to
     comfort her apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact
     she finds so thrilling.

                            GIRL

                      (exulting)
                  Texas...
     The mother hurries her along in the direction of distant
     lights.

                            GIRL (CONT'D)

                      (more emphatically)
                  Texas.

17   EXT. ELEVATED HIGH SHOT...HIGHWAY                            17

     The two of them waiting, small figures.

                            GIRL

                  Mamá, Texas..
     She raises her fingers like pistols. Shoots, blows in them
     and reholsters them.

18   EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK                                          18

     Bus traveling the highway. The child looks out sadly.




                                                                 8.








                          GIRL

                Adios, Texas.

                                                 TRANSITION TO:


19   EXT. NORTH VALLEY STREET - EARLY EVENING                     19

     As they disembark...the mother studying a slip of
     paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime. The
     child fascinated by all.

                          NARRATOR

                At the time, I was oblivious to my
                mother's anguish. She loved and
                lived to talk. Now, as if by a
                witch's spell, words were no longer
                her bridge but her barrier. In a
                very real sense she feared she had
                left herself behind.

     ON THE TWO FEMALES.

     The mother sees something. Joy returns.

     HER POV.

     A street full of stores with SIGNS IN SPANISH..She begins
     walking the street asking passers-by for directions in
     Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with
     relief. So far so very, very good.

20   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - DAY - FIVE MONTHS LATER..                20

     An iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second
     floor horseshoe of apartments.

                          NARRATOR

                We moved into a place managed by my
                mother's aunt. My mother worked two
                jobs in two local stores paying a
                total of 450 dollars a week...

21   INT. APT. - DAY                                              21

     As the mother enters.

                          NARRATOR

                ..just ever so barely enough.

22   INT. APT. - KITCHEN - CLOSER SHOT..                          22

     Cristina taking a newspaper from her book bag and seriously
     pondering - then circling grocery coupons.

     ANGLE ON KITCHEN AREA.





                                                               9.







     Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the
     note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese
     on a tortilla.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               But we were fine. We had it down.
               If only I could have stayed six.
     The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to:

23   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - ELEVATED SHOT - SIX YEARS LATER.       23

     The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a
     wedding reception is in progress -

     EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE.

     Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep,
     explosive smile.
     BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now
     nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some
     other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of
     a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality
     sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him
     saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to
     you. I need oxygen when I look at you." She indicates the six
     children she is dancing with and offers to include him in
     some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of
     just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock
     away..

     OTHER ANGLE..

     A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at
     first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing
     her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the
     rest of the children for a dance..

     MOVING WITH THE BOY..

     As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is
     interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he
     asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.

     ON CRISTINA..

     Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first
     time held by a male, the first time held close, the first
     sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
     eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his
     hips into his dancing partner.

     ON HER MOTHER.

     Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about
     to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is
     scare the car.




                                                              10.







     She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming
     his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts
     him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the
     head maternally and goes back to Cristina.

     CRISTINA.

     Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene.

                           NARRATOR

                 That quickly it was clear she could
                 no longer work two jobs and leave
                 me to my own at night. The
                 following morning she did something
                 about it. A boy I never saw again
                 had changed our lives.

24   INT. BUS - DAY                                               24

     The mother and her aunt, MONICA, take their seats..the bus is
     filled with domestics..the mother, nervous, looks over to see
     and greet... THE BRIDE from last night's wedding.

25   INT. BUS - DAY - 90 MINUTES LATER.                           25


                           BRIDE

                     (to mom)
                 Este es Stone Canyon.

26   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY                                      26

     MUSIC CHANGE..as they disembark and start walking, joining
     the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the
     hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. Grand
     trees from either side meet each other high over the road.

     ON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK

     She sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is
     not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin
     version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in
     the background, one black SUV after another has a mother
     taking kids home from school.

27   EXT. ATTRACTIVE HOME SECURITY GATE - DAY                     27

     Monica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open.

28   EXT. HOUSE - DAY.                                            28

     In the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt...and huge
     rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A catering truck stands
     in the driveway.

29   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - GREAT KITCHEN / POOL - DAY               29

     They enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn,
     pool and pool house. They look off.




                                                           11.








THEIR POV.

DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific"
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.

THE TWO LATINAS.

As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the
pool..as they start out..

THEIR EXIT.

Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open
after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react.
Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to
join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of
it..too late in the day for sudden movements.

KITCHEN DOORWAY.


                       BERNICE

             Gee whiz in heaven...How are you?
             Please?

                       DEBORAH

                 (a bit hyper)
             Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was
             looking for decoration to put on
             the glass so people would stop
             walking into it and instead of
             taking what they had in stock,
             which was awful, I special ordered.
             I'll design something myself which
             I should have done in the fi...
Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose,
gestures that Monica needs help not conversation.

                       DEBORAH (CONT'D)

             ..and what difference does that
             make when your nose is bleeding.
             Shut up, Deborah.

                       BERNICE

             Now you got it, Mom.




                                                             12.







     Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the
     freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
     kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to
     feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
     experience.

                         DEBORAH

               Here, take these.
                   (second thought)
               Was that strange to give you
               money..I just felt badly that..

                            MONICA

               It's okay.
     She pockets the cash.

30   EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                                  30

     Moments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table.
     Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
     hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test
     which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
     some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
     her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard
     becoming more beautiful even as we look.

                         MONICA

               She is my niece. She and her
               daughter live in the apartment I
               manage. Yolanda, who worked for
               you, lived there before she went
               back home. That's how I heard about
               the job.

                         DEBORAH

               So who am I interviewing?

                            MONICA

               Her.

                         DEBORAH

                   (forcefully)
               You're gorgeous.
     On our gal..as she, not understanding the word, smiles and
     nods.

                         MONICA

                   (translating sotto)
               Vistosos.
     Our gal thrown. Not knowing how now to react.

                         EVELYN

               She doesn't mean it as a
               compliment. It's more of an
               accusation.




                                                        13.








                    DEBORAH

          This is my daughter Bernice and
          this is my mother, Evelyn Norwich..

                     BERNICE

              (rising)
          Excuse me...Glad you're okay.
              (then to other Latina)
          Good luck.
Our gal smiles back in appreciation.

                    DEBORAH

          No, stay..this involves you.

                    BERNICE

          I wouldn't want some kid around for
          my interview. You understand, Mom.

                    EVELYN

              (to Bernice)
          Strength of character..empathy..big
          heart..taste for futility - God I
          love you.
She eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.

                     DEBORAH


          MOTHER!

               (then to Bernice)
          Stop. It's just a conversation -
          not an interview. Please sit.
               (to visitors)
          Don't you want to get out of the
          sun?
She indicates a shaded seat. Deborah is protected by hat,
umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. Underneath
Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt
emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.

                    DEBORAH (TO OUR GAL) (CONT'D)

          You guys want some lemonade?
              (they demur)
          Let's just talk. I have two
          children. My husband works
          nights..he's a chef and has his own
          place.

                    MONICA

          Do you work?

                    DEBORAH

          I helped run a commercial design
          company until ten months ago when




                                                        14.








                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          it was downsized to zip. Okay. I
          have two children. I like the house
          to be like me in that I'm very
          loose and meticulous at the same
          time. It's all about first names
          and closeness here but I care about
          the place, you know. It's what they
          used to call homemaker..
The two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look. Which Deborah
sees and understands.

                     DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (to Monica)
          I'm not leaving time for you to
          translate.
Monica says, in Spanish, "this woman is very strange. The
only thing I understand is she has two kids." Deborah leans
into Monica. Face to face, tender but unblinking..

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Too bad for you that it just never
          occurred to you to check on how
          much Spanish I know.

                    MONICA

              (a solid beat of
               humiliation then)
          I'm sorry what I say about
          you...don't hold it against her.

                    BERNICE

          Mom!!

                    DEBORAH

          I don't speak any Spanish. But I'm
          not an idiot - I talk for an hour
          and you say two words. What did you
          say?
Monica squirms - unusual for her.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Never mind. You got your nose
          bopped. I got my feelings hurt.
          Onward.
As Monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is
DIALED DOWN for the:

              (as Deborah continues
               talking)
          I will major in linguistics and
          make sociology my sub-
          concentration. Because it has been
          my experience that the barriers of

          language are more than we dare
          admit. That, as much as we
          translate, finally we will never
          understand each other. My mother's
          name, for example, beautiful in
          Spanish, becomes leaden and awful
          when pronounced by a non-Latin.

                    DEBORAH (IN THE CLEAR)

          What's your name? Llamo? One of my
          five Spanish words..

                    OUR GAL

          Flor Moreno.
She pronounces Flor in the Latin way...lots of RRRR's with a
curling of the tongue sound at the end.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.
She pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk
on...throughout the following each of the women sticks to
their pronunciation as indicated by the extra "r's.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (trying)
          Florrrrr.

                    DEBORAH

          Flor..what I walk on?

                      MONICA AND EVELYN

          Florrrrr.




                                                        16.








                      FLOR

          Florrrrr.

                    BERNICE

          It means flower, right?

                    MONICA

          Yes. Flower. Florrrrr.

                      EVELYN

          Florrrrr.

                      FLOR

          Florrrrr.
Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a
beat..eyes everyone with some hostility.

                    DEBORAH

              (directly to Flor)
          Is there some school of the ear I'm
          flunking out of right now?
Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name.
Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming
clearly and strangely pissed..

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          What did she say?

CLOSE ON FLOR...

She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own
irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves
forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance.
She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the
first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to
Deborah.

                    MONICA

              (translating)
          She says..If you curl your tongue
          and let it be loose you will have
          it..that it's hard for Americans..
          She says it's great that you try so
          hard. Many people wouldn't bother.

                    DEBORAH

              (an emotional
               pronouncement/her
               greatest accolade)
          She gets me....
She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile.




                                                         17.








                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          You want some lemonade? Take some
          lemonade.
She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes
and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort:

                      DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Florrrrr.
It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her
hands together.

                    FLOR

              (a Spanish word)
          Sublime.
Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark
corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier,
innocent..Wholly and completely attractive.

                    DEBORAH

          Whew, dense but stubborn, right?
          Thanks.
              (an important declaration)
          What you just did with me is just
          what kids need..patience and
          encouragement. Alright, money...
Bernice rises like a shot to take off..

                    BERNICE

          Goodbye, really..
              (to Flor)
          Look forward to seeing you.
As she leaves.

                    DEBORAH

              (absently to Bernie)
          Love you...
              (then with not a
               monoseconds break)
          ... the job is six days a week,
          seven to seven..the kids and all
          housekeeping, how much a week would
          you like?
Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness,
ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say.."

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          No.. This is an important
          question..if you ask for too little
          it means you don't value




                                                                18.










                  yourself..too much and you're
                  taking advantage.
                      (after Monica translates)
                  So?
     Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not
     without some native wit and style to maneuver around it.

                            FLOR

                      (extremely heavy accent)
                  One thousand dollars.
     Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah
     now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her
     face and shaking her head.

     OTHER ANGLE..

     As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh,
     flash four fingers to Flor..

     ON EVELYN.

     Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they
     should go for six.

                            MONICA

                      (firmly)
                  Six hundred dollars.
     Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat.

                            DEBORAH

                  Welcome to the family..
     Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of
     Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the
     first of many borders to be violated.

31   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     31

     As Flor and Monica exit and can finally show their full joy.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


32   EXT. STONE CANYON - EVENING.                                 32

     JOHN CLASKY driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat,
     talented, successful man with an ego as balanced as a high-
     end watch; who loves his wife, kids and job. In other words,
     watch out, John.

33   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 33

     As John pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and
     exits his SUV carrying a large wrapped tray..




                                                             19.








34   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 34

     As John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the
     tray on a counter where food servers are working.

                         JOHN

               I brought some dessert.
     As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap
     and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may
     notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and
     whispers to him.

                         CATERER

               She came down to check on the party
               and realized the gardeners hadn't
               finished rolling the sod.

35   INT. / EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                  35


     JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS.

     Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the
     last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
     manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving
     physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that
     it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.

                         DEBORAH

                   (to catering women)
               We can do it. Come on.
     She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
     they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
     one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,
     even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (great exertion)
               Why... do... I... care.. so..
               much.. about.... CRAP?
     And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
     out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,
     spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
     experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
     heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
     She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Can you believe they left without
               finishing?
     As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A
     grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame.




                                                       20.








                    DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D)

          Looks great, huh?.... You're not
          looking.

                    JOHN

          I was getting a kick looking at you
          look at it.
Not the answer she wanted..

                    DEBORAH

          I better get dressed again in case
          anybody's just a half hour late.
She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.

                     DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (a replenishing sigh)
          Okay..We're okay here.
              (then)
          Why can't everything be like sod?
          There's no wait, no dung, nothing
          you have to do right and yet it's
          perfect. It covers up all your
          dirt and makes things immediately
          pretty..then, the miracle, if you
          just give it time, it roots and you
          can't tell it from the real thing.
              (a look to her husband)
          No reaction. Nothing to say.

                    JOHN

          Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I
          don't have anything particular to
          say.

                    DEBORAH

          Oh, John why don't you just take
          out a knife and kill me all
          together.
Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.

                    JOHN

          How'd you get there..Hey, wait a
          minute..Deb..stop..come on.
              (she turns)
          I'd like to figure this one out.
          What would have been the great
          thing for me to say after you said
          the sod sentence?..Really.




                                                             21.








                         DEBORAH

               That's actually a good question.

                         JOHN

               There you go. I surprise sometimes.

                         DEBORAH

               I would have liked, if after I
               compared the sod to life, if you
               had said, "Exactly!"
     She turns to leave.

                         JOHN

               Yeah. But to say that and mean it
               I'd have to think the same way you
               do.

                          DEBORAH

                    (some sense of mischief)
               It's worth a try...I had something
               else to tell you...it'll come to
               me..

36   INT. OLIVE GARDEN TYPE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                 36

     Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant,
     Cristina, totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess
     with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother, standing
     beside her, bounces with energy and joy.

                         CRISTINA

               Could we have a table for two,
               please?
     Flor says something to her in Spanish..the daughter waves it
     off and when the mother persists, she translates.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               We're celebrating.

                         HOSTESS

               Smoking or non-smoking?
     Before her daughter can translate.

                           FLOR

               Dancing!
     The hostess laughs..They are seated at the two ends of a
     banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting
     and "scootches" closely together. Cristina picks up a menu
     and points to the prices.

                         CRISTINA

               Wow, expensive..




                                                             22.







     Flor scoffs -- says she's making six hundred dollars a
     week..then looks at the prices and does a take. The hostess
     returns --- Cristina points to the menu.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               This is just for the starter?
     Flor, encouraging her daughter's spirit of adventure, places
     her hand over the prices in the menu.

                         HOSTESS

               Uh-huh..And those men would like to
               buy you a drink.
     The daughter translates...the hostess points out the early
     30's, well dressed, quite nice looking businessmen. Flor
     addresses the men who are several tables away. Cristina
     moves uncomfortably but responds to her mother's nudge to
     translate.

                         CRISTINA

                   (to men)
               This is very embarrassing but--
               "what's wrong with you? I'm with
               my daughter for God's sake!"
     Then hostess, Flor and finally Cristina laugh. Cristina
     relishes getting back to ordering from the menu...in a moment
     that is a bit noteworthy..

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               And I would like to begin with the
               Jumbo Shrimp.

37   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY - 6:30 A.M.                          37

     Flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus
     from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of
     domestics. Deborah jogs into view.

                         DEBORAH

               Hi, Flor..See you up there.
     Deborah runs past..She is clearly upset..She is also more
     than a stay-in-shape jogger. She is an athletic woman fueled
     by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. This makes her
     seriously quick. She is highly aware of passing
     everybody..She needs to pass everybody..Her voice trails
     behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left,
     please," "left," "left."

38   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY                           38

     John enters his son's room..GEORGIE, age 9.




                                                             23.








                         JOHN

               Okay...think SERIOUSLY about
               getting up. You don't have to get
               up yet but are you thinking
               seriously about it?

                         GEORGIE

               Yes.

                         JOHN

               Okay.

39   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.                           39

     Bernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with
     the filling and the last cooking process. Some great idea
     which will have us making a mental note to try it at home.

40   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS DAY - DAY                       40

     John opens Georgie's door again.

                         GEORGIE

               Now?

                         JOHN

               Yes..actual up..
     Georgie gets up..

                         GEORGIE

               Morning, Dad.

                         JOHN

               Yeah, good morning.

                         GEORGIE

               You as mad at me as Mom 'cause of
               what happened?
     John pauses..aware his answer will have repercussions but
     integrity wins.

                         JOHN

               No, Georgie, I'm not.

                         GEORGIE

               Are you mad at me?

                         JOHN

               Uh...okay, no..

41   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN DOORWAY - DAY                    41

     As Flor enters from outside.

                         BERNICE

               Morning, good to see you.




                                                        24.








                       FLOR

             Morning. Good too.
She notices the French Toast.

                          BERNICE

             Try some.
She demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula,
indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she
does...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open
at this kid's ability to make something mundane
special..Bernice laughs.

                          BERNICE (CONT'D)

             Thanks.
Her mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful,
tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her
current demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head,
making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to
Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.

                          DEBORAH

             Tough day.
Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a
GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with
a ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen...
what's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the
self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice.

                       BERNICE

             I had an idea for a breakthrough in
             French toast so I made breakfast. I
             don't want to be teased about it..
             No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try
             it and if by any chance you have a
             positive reaction...

                       DEBORAH

             Right..mean ol' me. I can't play
             right now. I have to do something
             about your brother.

                       BERNICE

             I had an idea for a recipe. When
             has that happened? I got up early
             to do this. At least taste it, for
             God's sakes!
She does..

                       DEBORAH

             Oh, it's good...oh God, it's rich --
             Oh God, it's good.




                                                              25.








                         DEBORAH

                   (sudden alarm)
               By the way, you could do without
               this.
     The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at
     her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her
     daughter because her attention has been diverted so that
     Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager,
     distraught, moves from the room.

                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)

               NO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch.
     Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to
     accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout
     stopped her in mid-sentence.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I mean it, NEVER!
     ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I'm not mad. I'm thinking of you.
               This is me being nice..
     Then using her hands to demonstrate.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Just no taking ball from dog.
                   (broadly)
               Trust me on that one.
     CLOSE UP ON Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in
     front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               You and me. We are fine. Just a
               tip.
                    (she gives her waist a
                     little squeeze)
               Girlfriends.
                    (Flor is totally confused)
               Could you make some coffee? Cafe?

                         FLOR

               Yes.
     Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino
     machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised.

42   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY        42

     Deb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos,
     conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a
     sponge..such fluffy towels.




                                                             26.







     Skylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth. There
     is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of
     this being that these people have a fireplace in their
     bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a
     contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye
     and one brown.

                         JOHN

               This isn't an argument, honey.

                         DEBORAH

               Yes. Yes it is. So stop being so
               maniacally calm.

                          JOHN

                   (emphatically)
               No..it's not. Because I understand
               your side.

                         DEBORAH

               I can't be wrong about that too.
               This is a fight. We're having a
               fight. Yo, I feel anger.
     Deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one
     blue. She blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back
     to the sink.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Can I have a moment?
     John exits into the..

43   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  43

     As John awaits his wife...a beat and she enters with two blue
     eyes. Even though she is attempting reason and self-control
     her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to
     borderline yelling.

                         DEBORAH

               Okay..Let's get someplace here.

44   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                         44

     As Flor works methodically - orienting herself..she is able
     to hear their totally foreign words and though their volume
     registers on her a bit - basically she remains blithe.
     Loading a dishwasher, memorizing where everything is..

45   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  45


     BACK TO SCENE:


                         DEBORAH

               You, mister, are crazy making..I
               can't take this calm thing you've




                                                        27.








                    DEBORAH

          started doing. It's like this is
          your way of letting me know there's
          something deeply wrong with me
          because I'm not calm.

                    JOHN

              (calmly)
          Let's not go all over the
          place..Can't we...

                    DEBORAH

              (shouted burst)
          If you're going to talk to me
          please have the decency to raise
          your voice.

                     JOHN

              (a beat then sudden
               urgency and change of
               tone)
          Let's make a break for it.

                    DEBORAH

          What are you talking about?
He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standing...then additional faster steps. He gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room. She eyes him suspiciously.

                    JOHN

          Just for a second.
She walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. And
gestures back to where they were standing. He talks in an
almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          We don't have to be those people.
          Nobody's watching. They've been
          masquerading as us for a while
          here..I'll distract them - you make
          a break for it and I'll meet you
          outside.

                    DEBORAH

          You're ridiculing me because I care
          about this.

                    JOHN

              (firmly)
          No. I'm not. I mean this..let's get
          away from those two in case they're
          as miserable as they look..




                                                           28.








                    JOHN

              (urging..like a Southern
               coach)
          Come on, baby.
He is looking at her with wit and conviction..trying to
squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. Deborah
looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.

                    DEBORAH

          Let me ask you a question..let me
          change the subject..Forget for a
          moment that you won't support me
          with Georgie..

                    JOHN

              (reasonably)
          Well, I don't think...
She makes a noise of frustration to stop him..It   works. John
is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct   but he is
"man" enough for his jaw to set...to pause for a   beat as he
looks her straight in the eye..And walks back to   the spot
they occupied previously.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

          Go ahead.

                    DEBORAH

          Here's the question. It's been on
          my mind more and more. Do you do
          that calm thing for the purpose of
          infuriating me?

                    JOHN

              (genuinely puzzled)
          What? Why would ...
              (on her exasperated look)
          Why would anyone do something to
          someone they love for the purpose
          of messing them up?

                    DEBORAH

              (unconvinced/distant)
          Okay.
He hates that look of isolation on her face..He needs to make
her feel better.

                    JOHN

          Deb, since high school we've been
          able to read each other...take
          advantage of it..The answer to the
          question is,"absolutely not." Now
          take a look and tell me if you
          believe me.




                                                              29.







     She looks at him..with a finger motion he directs her gaze to
     his eyes..
     CLOSE on JOHN'S EYES.
     Open, smiling, trusting. Trying to get a laugh out of her.

     CLOSE ON DEBORAH'S EYES.

     Studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted...

                         DEBORAH

               I don't.. believe you. I think you
               just want me to feel badly about
               myself..Sorry, honey.

46   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            46

     John enters - not seeing Flor - goes to the Sparkletts water
     container and fills a cup...He is shaken..

                         JOHN

                   (to himself)
               Great God in heaven save me.
     Boy meets girl.

                         FLOR

               Hi.
     He turns with a start to see Flor smiling at him. Gorgeous
     squared. His first word is inadvertent.

                         JOHN

               Whoa...whoa...I didn't know Deborah
               had found someone... You work here?
               You're going to help with the house
               and kids?

                         FLOR

               Solo español.

                         JOHN

               You work here and you don't speak
               any English at all?
     The sound of feet on the stairs..Deborah and Georgie enter.

                          DEBORAH

               All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and
               press two for Spanish.
                   (even before she enters)
               Flor...John.
                   (to John enunciating the
                    name)
               This is Flor.




                                                             30.








                         JOHN

                   (pronouncing it perfectly)
               Hi, Flor.
     Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (to Deborah)
               Look, I'll take Georgie to school.

                         DEBORAH

               No. I'm doing it..show Flor the
               ropes.
     Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then
     Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and
     come with her.

47   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           47

     The biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle
     custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite
     fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and
     shares a woman to woman moment with Flor.

                         DEBORAH

               Fuckin' hombres, huh?
     She sniffles. Flor nods uncertainly. A small voice from the
     back seat..Georgie..

                         GEORGIE

               I just didn't want to sing last
               night.

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                   (hurt)
               Yeah. Well you said you would..You
               said you wanted to. I asked you
               five times. Then when I have the
               whole party paying attention you
               refused.
     As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well.
     But he's just two lines into an old blues standard:

                         DEBORAH

               It doesn't do any good now,
               Georgie.
     She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes
     up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid-
     song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a
     divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for
     her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a
     Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting."




                                                             31.








                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I've programmed it for Spanish..
               Look, it will take you anywhere and
               then back home. If you figured out
               how to make coffee on that thing
               it's all downhill.
     The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns. Flor
     is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is
     singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by
     the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her
     life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses
     anything.

                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)

               This is stop gap..You, kiddo,
               you're going to have to learn
               English.

48   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                  48

     John cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they
     are seen doing what they do best applies here.. In the
     BACKGROUND John's number two, PETER, the Sous Chef, being
     bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and GWEN, who
     spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection
     for John. At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of
     art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but
     he keeps dropping items.....each time a Latin kitchen worker,
     ALEX, 20, dives on the spillage..At one point they bump.

                          JOHN

               Sorry...

                         PETER

                   (sharply to Alex)
               Not the best place to stand, fella.

                         JOHN

                   (to Alex)
               No. It's me. You're the new
               helper, huh..

                         ALEX

               I didn't mean to...

                         JOHN

               No..no..it's okay. It's me being
               bugged.
     Two people head for John almost simultaneously. PEG, an arty
     looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair,
     enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'.

                         PEG

               You are going to be so happy..
     The Maitre D' enters.




                                                        32.








                    MAITRE D'

          I have something very important to
          tell you.
John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman
who promised happiness. She hefts her ice chest up on the
counter.

                    PEG

          Perfect cod this is John -- John,
          perfect cod..Best one I've seen all
          season and he was swimming twenty
          minutes ago.
The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a
writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. You get it..

                    JOHN

          Knockout.
              (to Alex)
          You want to learn something? You
          want to pack it away?
The kid nods.. he picks up the fish.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Cradle it...Put it in the cooler
          but not on its side.. In the same
          position it swims.
              (important added thought)
          And check the ice pack..make sure
          it can drain away..if it can't the
          chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all
          that and nobody can put a fish in
          the fridge better than you...and
          that's a solid start.. First day
          and you already did something
          perfect.

                    KID

              (smiling)
          Yes, I understand.

                    MAITRE D'

          Please. Now?

                    JOHN

          Oh, sorry..I forgot.
He whispers in John's ear..

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Damn.. "ohhhh damn."

                    PETER

          What, buddy, what?




                                                        33.








                     JOHN

           Victor spotted a food critic..

                     PETER

           From?

                     VICTOR

           The New York Times..I'll bet they
           sent her out just for us.
               (hands John a slip)
           Here's what she ordered.

                     PETER

           Look, if you're nervous take a
           walk..

                     JOHN

           I don't need a walk.

                     GWEN

           I'll walk with you..I know a
           breathing thing.

                      JOHN

           What do you think I'm worried
           about... how I'll cook? That's not
           the problem..
               (looks at slip/then to
                Alex)
           The lady wants fish. Get the fish.
He starts to prepare for cooking.

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

           I worked in a kitchen once in New
           York that got four stars. It was
           like a line formed for the chance
           to become an asshole. People's
           accents changed. The heart went out
           of the place. You understand.

                     PETER

           No.

                      GWEN

               (w/barely understated
                passion)
           I agree with everything you've
           said. I admire you for your
           feelings. I hope to adopt them as
           my own....

ON JOHN.

As he works..Let's be clear here...this is that sequence that
either kicks out or doesn't..no food channel..no simple knife
stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous...smart and
gifted as he prepares the critic's meal.




                                                             34.







     He is talking quickly..almost to himself.

                         JOHN

               I don't know what to root for.. the
               thought of one star makes me
               nauseous..but with four there's no
               place to go but, "Oh my God, they
               took away a star."
                   (musing)
               Three..three and a half. That's
               what you want..No. Wrong! Three and
               a half you feel disappointed that
               you just missed out on four. You
               know what you want? Three and a
               quarter..
                   (a eureka moment)
               That would be perfect!!
                   (getting off on it)
               It would mean you're good..but
               you're not good enough to feel
               disappointed that you just missed
               out on excellent..but nothing truly
               bad happened, you still got your
               three and a quarter stars. Which
               encourages you to try and
               improve..And you still get enough
               respect so that you can get good
               people to work with you..Business
               is good but not crazy. You're right
               there underneath the radar where
               you get to mind your own business.
               That's a solid life.
     He tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (with professional honesty
                    and some regret)
               Aw, man..this is amazing. No three
               and a quarter here.

49   INT. CLASKY KITCHEN - DAY.                                49

     Evelyn, having a glass of white wine and a sandwich, is
     talking to Bernice in the kitchen also including Flor though
     she is only catching a word here or there..

                         EVELYN

               Well, I'm in the vitamin section
               and this little hip hop
               girl..what's her name..Grammys -
               adorable -- big voice..subtle
               phrasing...oh, she's famous..the
               kids know her...oh - little blue
               shoes..darn me.
     Flor looks concerned over Evelyn's displeasure with herself,
     a fact picked up by the older woman...It is actually a small




                                                        35.







but resonant good-natured, affectionate moment between the
lush and the Latina.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)

          God Bless the language barrier, it
          keeps you from being bored with me.
Spoken to directly like this, Flor is confused..

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)

          Anyway, she said, "aren't you
          Evelyn Wright?" First of all, that
          she recognized me from the old
          covers and then she .... Oh, please
          her name..it makes the story so
          much better...She said,
              (genuinely stirred)
          "Whenever I think everything is.."
              (aside)
          Pardon my French..pardon her French
              (back to quote)
          "a mother hmmmhmmm...I put on one
          of your records.."

                    BERNICE

          Awwww. How sweet....
Evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second. Flor
reacts. Bernie squeezes her grandmother's hand..Flor smiles.

                    EVELYN

          Just such a lovely thing to come
          from the blue....
Deborah enters, carrying a load of packages. With lightning
speed, her eye picks out...the glass her mother is drinking
from.

                    DEBORAH

          Oh, Mother...It's not even noon.

                    EVELYN

              (defensively)
          It's almost two o'clock.

                    DEBORAH

          God, where is this day going...Flor
          could you come with me?

                    BERNICE

          Grandma, tell Mom what happened.

                      EVELYN

                (very deliberately)
          No.




                                                             36.







     Deborah leads the way out...but Flor stops before following
     her out to give Evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation.

50   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                          50

     John is in Bernie's room - helping her with her homework.
     They lay at right angles to each other..He is testing her.

                         JOHN

               This is going to work.

                         BERNICE

               I don't know anything.

                         JOHN

               Free your mind...the president
               whose policies many consider
               responsible for the Great
               Depression...

                         BERNICE

               I don't know...

                         JOHN

               Name a vacuum cleaner..

                         BERNICE

               Okay. Yes..thanks.

                         JOHN

               And this vacuum whooshed all this
               money out of everyone's pockets.

                         BERNICE

               Got it. I no longer know nothing.

                         JOHN

               And Hoover was followed in office
               by..

                         BERNICE

               I'm just drawing blanks. I'm
               embarrassed. It's my own fault I
               spent my time on math, which I'm
               lucky if I don't flunk anyway and..

                         JOHN

               The guy we are looking for is not a
               ruse..

                         BERNICE

               What's ruse mean?

                         JOHN

               Phony. So this president was not a
               ruse..He was the real thing.




                                                             37.








                         JOHN

                   (she looks at him blankly)
               Ruse??

                         BERNICE

                   (enjoying her father's
                    absurdity)
               Rusevelt..If I'd ever heard of the
               word before - that would lock it
               in..It's so stupid it might work
               anyway...
     Deborah enters followed by Flor. They are carrying several
     boxes of clothes...

                         DEBORAH

               Surprise new clothes..
     Bernie gasps..As she looks at a sweater..

                         BERNICE

               What'd I do right?

                         DEBORAH

               Warehouse sale..
     Bernice tries on the sweater over her T-shirt..and mirth
     ends..The sweater is tight...Bernice picks up a blouse and
     then skirt and checks the size.

     ON FLOR AND JOHN.

     As they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA ANGLE as each catches on
     and is dumbfounded.

     ON BERNICE..

     Whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to
     deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though mightily stung:

                         BERNICE

               Thanks, mom..I'm glad you didn't
               get here a little earlier or else I
               wouldn't be able to tell you that
               your gift is a ruse. Please, excuse
               me..
     She exits to her bathroom.

51   INT. STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING                               51

     Flor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly
     down the stairs...John pissed..Deborah feeling the futility
     of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it.




                                                              38.








                         DEBORAH

               She's right between the two
               sizes..I thought about it..what am
               I supposed to do encourage
               her...what is it? - DENIAL? Or
               motivate her to get herself in
               shape.
     Flor tries to slide by..Something surreptitious in her
     behavior..Deborah suddenly turns to Flor.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Flor..
     She holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture.
     Flor does not waver..just meets her eyes.

                         FLOR

               Me puedo ir?..go..can go?

                         DEBORAH

                   (a bit nonplussed)
               Sure. Go.

                         JOHN

               I'll drive you to the bus stop.
     And that fast they are gone.

52   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           52

     As John gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door
     and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes.

                         JOHN

               Sorry. I'm cracking.
     As he moves back to his side of the vehicle.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (a shout)
               Shiiiiiiit!
     Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement.

53   INT. JOHN'S CAR - EARLY EVENING..                            53

     As they drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even
     if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself
     anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

               I am running out of excuses for the
               lady of the house.
     Flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. But
     then John takes rein of his emotions.




                                                        39.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          But you know, you gotta watch out
          for the times you think you're
          absolutely right..But, man, Bernice
          has finals tomorrow. She didn't
          need this one..And just that look
          on her face when she got the gifts--
              (now his voice cracks; he
               grows wet-eyed)
          --like for a second she thought all
          her problems with her mother had
          been solved...
Flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually
crying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there
is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the
macho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces
front quickly.

                    NARRATOR

          My mother did not understand her
          male boss. His heart was good and
          he was rare in not flirting with
          her. But they were starkly
          different. Privacy and dignity were
          the same word to my mother.
          Naturally, when she found herself
          sitting next to a man who cried
          over his child's hurt she had no
          idea how to process the event.
Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the
canyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt.

                     FLOR

          Gracias.
She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is
still rolling a bit...

                    JOHN

          What are you doing? Let me take you
          all the way.
Reluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet
to her bus stop and she gets out again.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          How weird was this ride? Sorry.

                    FLOR

          No es nada.
He doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a
little helpless gesture..




                                                               40.








54   EXT. BUS STOP - EARLY EVENING..                             54

     As Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward.

                         NARRATOR

               The job was taxing her. She had no
               template for confusion let alone
               frustration.
     While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few
     yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her
     colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them
     adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor
     unsuccessfully try to shake off her day.

55   INT. FLOR'S APT. - EVENING                                  55

     As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and
     distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and
     takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a
     huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled
     daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the
     daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure.

                         NARRATOR

               It was so unusual for my mother to
               ask my help that I realized
               immediately she was losing her
               battle to be uninvolved with the
               Claskys.
     Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English.

                            CRISTINA

               Try it on.
     Flor asks again in Spanish...trying to find a precise
     phrase.. The nuance important to her.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               Please try it on?
     Flor knows the word "please"..it's not what she wants...what
     she wants is a way to say, "try it on" in a manner which is
     not a request..or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring.
     Her daughter works on the problem.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               Just try it on?

                         FLOR

                   (thickly accented)
               Just try it on.

                         CRISTINA

                   (small accent)
               Just try it on.




                                                             41.








                         FLOR

                   (improvement each time)
               Just try it on...just try it on..
     She's got it.

                         NARRATOR

               Our culture embraces fullness in a
               woman. You, the women of the
               admissions committee, as
               intelligent as you are, have no
               idea how casual and complete such
               acceptance is back home, in the
               land of the size 16 bikini.

56   EXT. BUS STOP - NORTH VALLEY - PRE-DAWN                   56

     Flor is the only one waiting. An empty bus stops and she gets
     on.

57   EXT. STREET - NEAR BUS STOP - HIGH SHOT - FIRST LIGHT     57

     As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd., overtake and pass two
     UCLA men running at a good clip as Flor's bus stops.

     CLOSE ON FLOR..

     As she strides purposefully up the street.

                         NARRATOR

               This is one of the cultural
               differences between us which I wish
               to explore academically at
               Princeton. American women, I
               believe, actually feel the same as
               Hispanic women about weight.

58   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EXTREME EARLY MORNING                 58

     The house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.

                         NARRATOR

               ....a desire for the comfort of
               fullness.

59   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - FIRST LIGHT                          59

     Bernie asleep on the bed...Kleenex abounds...the solid sleep
     earned by a few hours of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty
     and decidedly round. Flor looks for, finds and carries out
     the new clothes Deborah had given her daughter.

                          NARRATOR

               And, when that desire is suppressed
               for style and deprivation allowed
               to rule...




                                                               42.








60   EXT. STREET - STEEP INCLINE                                  60


     ANGLE ON DEBORAH & KILLER HILL:

     Two young athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of
     her on the steep incline.

                         DEBORAH

               Left..left..

     ON RUNNERS.

     They turn and look confused at Deborah who is so far behind
     them she has no need to pass..They turn away. Deborah
     struggles to turn it on and does so...huffing to just behind
     them where she utters one more strained:

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Left.
     And then passes.

                         NARRATOR

               ...dieting, exercising American
               women become afraid of everything
               associated with being curvaceous,
               such as wantonness, lustfulness,
               sex, food, motherhood..all that is
               good in life.

61   INT. CLASKY MAID'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING.                     61

     Flor at work on a sewing machine..opening seams, moving
     buttons, even steaming where the buttons have been
     changed..etc.

62   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - MORNING                                 62

     Flor is in the room...having put the altered clothes back in
     place..Bernie's alarm clock rings..She wakes and sees Flor.

                         BERNICE

               Hey..buenas dias, Flor..
     Flor holds up the new clothes and indicates that they are
     beautiful.

                         BERNICE (CONT'D)

                   (ruefully)
               Yes..Well, taste she has..
     Bernie starts her morning routine..her back to us when:

                         FLOR

                   (damn good English)
               Just try it on.




                                                         43.







Bernie, though her back is to us, does a "take" then turns
grinning.

                    BERNICE

          Hey!!!! When did you learn to...

                    FLOR

              (cutting her off)
          Just try it on..

                    BERNICE

          Too tight..it doesn't fit.
Flor clearly doesn't understand..

                    FLOR

          Just try it on..Hey?!
Flor extends a blouse and skirt.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          Just..

                    BERNICE

          Okay. I'll show you..
She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on,
muttering pessimistically before she does so. CAMERA STAYS ON

FLOR..


                    BERNICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)

          Lovely way to start the day.
          World's most trim Mexican learns
          her first sentence and uses it to
          watch me grrrrunt my way into...
And then....silence...Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing
the clothes which fit like a glove. Flor beams..then laughs
at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and
looks into the mirror.

INTO MIRROR.

To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods
approval and leaves.

ON BERNIE..

The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she
picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies
it a bit.

CLOSE UP SHIRT..

As Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the
buttons have previously been.




                                                             44.








63   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            63

     Flor at work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges
     her.

                         FLOR

                   (to dog)
               Lo siento. No.
     Chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..Bernie enters. She
     is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with
     one word.

                         BERNICE

               Hey..
     Flor turns..Bernie moves to embrace her.

64   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER              64

     As John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From
     the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going
     out the front door as he turns to check it out.

65   INT. DEN - DAY..                                             65

     John finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes. They
     are singing an old song...something like "LUSH LIFE" -
     something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't
     knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him
     and stop.

                         EVELYN

               Every time he has a nightmare, I
               teach him one of my old songs. That
               way the nightmares have a purpose.

                         GEORGIE

               But I don't have to sing it for
               anyone.

                         JOHN

               Right. You're clear on that..

                         GEORGIE

               How many did you sell of this song?

                          EVELYN

                   (embarrassed in front of
                    John)
               He likes to know that stuff.

                         JOHN

                   (to Georgie)
               She was huge.




                                                                45.








                          EVELYN

                Seventy-six thousand..which is
                great for a jazz album.
      They resume harmonizing. As John leaves, the song lyric
      making some comment on:

66    EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                      66

      As John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum
      proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick
      up the New York Times. John's body chemistry launches a
      surprise attack...anxiety and dread...He takes his newspaper
      to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the
      section..opens to the page..and just like that his life
      changes forevermore.

67    INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     67

      John enters..Georgie is going up the stairs..Flor putting out
      breakfast food.

                            EVELYN

                You okay?

                           JOHN

                    (strangely)
                I am okay.
                    (to Flor)
                Deborah around?

                            FLOR

                She run.
      John nods and heads upstairs.

                                                                 67A


67A   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY

      He looks in Bernie's room. She is loading her backpack for
      school..

                          JOHN

                Hey, honey.

                          BERNICE

                What's wrong?

                          JOHN

                No..nothing...just that..
      Georgie enters the scene..

                          GEORGIE

                A kid offered me a trade..Let me
                show you.

                            JOHN

                Yeah..




                                                               46.







     He starts to follow him to his room.

                         BERNICE

               Dad!!! He can wait.

                         JOHN

               No..It's okay..

                          BERNICE

               Let him wait..Yours is obviously
               important.

                         GEORGIE

               You don't even know how important
               the trade is..

                         JOHN

               Let me just do Georgie.... Here.
     He hands her the newspaper...

68   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - GEORGIE'S ROOM                          68

     We MOVE with John and Georgie to Georgie's room where he goes
     to his collectibles..He holds up a card..

                         GEORGIE

               He says he'll give me any three
               silvers for him.

                         JOHN

               I don't know...This is the one you
               started with..You really want to
               give up your first card?
     Note: this is an involved discussion on both their
     parts..NOTHING in John thinks it is trivial.

                         GEORGIE

               I know..that's why I needed you.

                         JOHN

               ..this is your favorite..

                         GEORGIE

               I think he'd go higher.

                         JOHN

               But it's not numbers..it's.....
     They are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of
     exultation..

69   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                          69

     Flor and Evelyn jolted..they exit to follow the sound..




                                                             47.








70   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY                                  70

     As they enter holding the paper. She has been smacked in the
     heart by gleeful and prideful emotions...It is disorienting
     for her to experience the rush of pleasure.

                         JOHN

               For God's sake..why did you...

                         BERNICE

               WHY?!!? CRAZY FATHER, WHY?!? Why
               aren't YOU screaming?..

                         JOHN

               I'm getting there..just the stunned
               thing has to get dealt with...

                         BERNICE

                   (reading from newspaper)
               John Clasky, who at 25 made his
               mark on the New York restaurant
               scene when JAMMED lived up to and
               survived its silly name, has re-
               emerged as a young and confident
               veteran taking chances with his
               combinations in so subtle a
               manner.."

                         GEORGIE

               If he gave me six...

                         JOHN

                   (catching her excitement)
               Wait a minute, your sister's
               talking.
     Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about
     John..and so she studies him a bit..

                         BERNICE

               "...beginning with the succession
               of appetizers, each one with its
               own stunning and fully realized
               agenda, is constantly yet casually
               daring."
                   (emotional and earnest
                    aside)
               Ah, Dad...this is so great...
                   (to others)
               Now here's the thing...
     She tears up...Evelyn rubs Bernie's back..looks at Flor and
     taps her heart...Flor indicates she should leave and does.
     Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and
     moment. John is taken with his daughter's delivery.




                                                             48.








                         BERNICE (CONT'D)

               "Eating at this perfect smaller,
               passionate restaurant inspires
               one's own abandonment of caution.
               To wit: John Clasky is the best
               chef in the United States."

                         JOHN

                   (genuinely enthusiastic)
               Look how great you read it.

                         BERNICE

                   (massive irony)
               Perfect, Dad.
     Evelyn and Bernice hug him..

                         EVELYN

               John..John...Oh, my God you even
               look different to me....

                         JOHN

               What are you talking about?

                         BERNICE

               I wonder what mom will do?

71   INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                               71

     Deborah is ripping John's clothes off..buttons fly..shreds of
     cloth..John is laughing - happy.

                         JOHN

               What is this?

                         DEBORAH

               I don't know.
     She rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion.

                           DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Oooohhch!

72   EXT. NORTH VALLEY - DAY.                                    72

     Flor walks to the news stand - as if to buy something --
     changes her mind and LEAVES THE FRAME only to RETURN A HALF-
     BEAT LATER where she reads to the dealer from a note.

                         FLOR

                   (heavily accented)
               New York Times..

73   INT. FLOR'S APT. - NIGHT...                                 73

     Cristina, standing, translating the review into Spanish for
     her mother...as she comes to the last sentence.




                                                                49.








                          CRISTINA

                Wow..."John Clasky es el mejor chef
                en Los Estados Unidos..

                          FLOR

                    (easily)
                Ah, bravo...

74   INT. CLASKY MASTER BEDROOM - DAY.                            74

     The Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are
     exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top
     BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile
     fades - she hits the skids.

                          DEBORAH

                Oh, damn it --- what am I going to
                do? Everything seems so surely
                pointless...

     ON JOHN.

     This IS WEIRD. And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's
     climax...then, in a relatively small voice.

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                Okay here...okay there...good,
                good, good.
     She falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back
     down the bed from him...

     ON JOHN.

     Puzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming
     his thought...then finally..hesitantly...

                            JOHN

                Hey, Deb?

                           DEBORAH

                    (from the vortex of
                      depression)
                Yeah?
     He scoots to her side.

                          JOHN

                You know, I guess I got used to you
                getting a little blue after
                intercourse...But DURING..??

                          DEBORAH

                Something else I do wrong.
     She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom.




                                                             50.








                         JOHN

               You've gotta stop walking away.

                         DEBORAH

                   (turning)
               If I stay, I will say awful things
               to you that I might not even
               mean..You pick.

                            JOHN

               See ya.
     She exits to the bathroom.

75   INT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY.                                    75

     Very upset as he drives. Then comes to the red light at the
     end of the street and sees Flor walking with others. An
     awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they
     acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers
     with another woman.

                         FLOR

                   (to woman)
               Yo leÌ la crÌtica buena.
     The woman tells Flor how to say it in English.

                         FLOR (CONT'D)

                   (parroting woman)
               I read your good review.
     He nods..still the light doesn't change.

                            FLOR (CONT'D)

               It's nice.
     The light changes.

                         JOHN

               Not so far...How you doing?
     The light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let
     him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer.

                            FLOR

               I do fine.
     He nods and drives off.

76   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY                                     76

     As he enters....the phone is going off the hook..As he passes
     the maitre d's desk. Their conversation is strangely hushed
     and very, very quick.




                                                     51.








                         VICTOR

               Should I stop answering? We're
               booked for two months solid.

                         JOHN

               No, no, no, no, no....I want to
               keep some walk-in business..I want
               this to stay neighborhood.

                         VICTOR

               Impossible. There would be
               riots..You should hear the
               desperation in their voices..Best
               day of my life.

                         JOHN

               We'll serve a full menu at the bar
               then.

                         VICTOR

               Then where do I put the people
               waiting for a table? It won't work.

                         JOHN

               Do this for me.

                         VICTOR

               There's no way.

                         JOHN

               Do this for me or I'll set my hair
               on fire and start punching myself
               in the face.

                         VICTOR

               Huh?

                         JOHN

               Yeah..you're right...that was an
               unusual way for me to make myself
               understood..But you'll do the bar
               thing?

                         VICTOR

               Yes, of course, John..

77   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY                     77


                         PETER

               I need to talk to you.

                         JOHN

               Ah, man..Okay.
     They walk into the cooling room.




                                                             52.








78   INT. RESTAURANT - COOLING ROOM - DAY                      78

     Again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation
     sparked by John..

                         JOHN

               What's up? What's wrong?

                         PETER

               I've gotten a fantastic offer for
               my own place..Everybody wants to
               back me since the paper came out.

                         JOHN

               What's your reaction?

                         PETER

               Honestly? Because I've had this
               very unusual reaction.

                         JOHN

               Yeah.

                         PETER

               I've had a hard on almost all day
               and it won't go away. Like I'm
               riding on the back seat of a bus
               with bad shocks and every other
               passenger is a gorgeous woman with
               a yellow sports top whose leaning
               over. It's like every dream I ever
               had and some even I didn't have the
               balls to dream..

                         JOHN

               So you're considering taking it?...
                   (he looks at him)
               Okay, here's the thing. I can't
               lose you and still keep the hours
               I'm keeping. I can't do my life
               unless I can hold onto you.
                   (sudden thought)
               I think I just gave you an
               incredible bargaining position.

79   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - NIGHT                               79

     As John and Deborah lay next to each other.

                         DEBORAH

               So you gave away twenty percent of
               the restaurant without talking to
               me about it.

                         JOHN

               Yeah. If I didn't do it - I'd have
               been coming home just to sleep.




                                                             53.








                         DEBORAH

                   (trying to make livid more
                    attractive)
               Remember the other day when you
               asked me the perfect response to
               something I said?...I'm asking you
               now..what would you like my
               response to be to your giving away
               twenty percent of the business
               without asking me?

                         JOHN

                   (with great enthusiasm)
               "You're ma man!"

                         DEBORAH

               Okay! So that would be???

                         JOHN

               My dream response from you, yes.

                         DEBORAH

                   (measured)
               I'm not quite there..Actually, I
               just had this flash that the reason
               women in the old days used to faint
               was to avoid doing acts of violence
               against men.
                   (a beat then)
               And I was all worried about
               figuring out the timing just to
               talk to you about renting a place
               for the summer.

                         JOHN

               Well, I think you got your timing.

80   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                     80

     A man is parked at the gate in an open convertible..He is
     great looking...We HEAR Deborah's excited voice over the gate
     speaker...

                         DEBORAH

               Be right out...

81   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - DAY..                                81

     As Deborah calls behind her as she opens the door...

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Mom, you want to come?..the
               realtor's here..Okay, see you
               later.
     She clicks the gate open and walks to the man..perfect 40
     year old great looking surfer sort..Deborah does the very
     slightest of "takes" at his looks..As she gets in..




                                                                54.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Hi.

                         REALTOR

               I'm Mike..there's one great rental
               that just came on..so we're
               starting at the top..
     As they pull away...

82   EXT. CONVERTIBLE - DAY..                                     82

     Deborah's hair whips across her face...it's bothersome.

                         DEBORAH

               I'll never be one of those girls
               whose hair blows perfectly in a
               convertible.

                         REALTOR

               Move your seat forward..
     Puzzled, she uses the electric lever and the seat budges
     forward..

                         REALTOR (CONT'D)

               A little more..just..good.
     The Realtor uses his switches and raises his window a
     bit..her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the
     half windows in back...Deborah turns around checking out the
     odd tweaking and then faces forward. Her hair blows perfectly
     and beautifully behind her...

                         DEBORAH

               Oh, you must be trouble.
     On his small laugh...

83   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                        83

     As they move toward the house...seeing the beach beyond.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Gorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous,
               beautiful. What word is the same in
               Spanish?

                            FLOR

               Fabuloso.

                         DEBORAH

                   (taking it as a
                    compliment)
               Thanks.




                                                               55.








84   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                       84

     As Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I don't care if it's a rental..this
               place is getting a fixing.
     She leads Flor to a small bedroom.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (to Flor with gestures)
               This will be yours..
     Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to.

                         EVELYN

               Did you ask her if she could live
               in?

                         DEBORAH

               Come on...there's no buses from her
               to here. There's no question.
               Double come on...
     Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like
     the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               The Barrio - Carbon Beach..The
               Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do?
                   (to Flor)
               Don't worry. I'm putting nicer
               stuff in here too.
     When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing,
     somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads
     her out.

85   EXT. CLASKY - BEACH RENTAL - DAY                            85

     As they move through a little courtyard area toward the
     street.

                         DEBORAH

               You must learn English. Why won't
               she learn English? I'm going to
               have to learn, "you must learn
               English," in Spanish.

                         EVELYN

               I think Flor is perfect and we
               should do all we can to keep her
               from changing.

                         DEBORAH

               Gee, you took the words right out
               of my mouthay.




                                                             56.








86   EXT. PCH - DAY                                               86

     As she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach -
     passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing
     someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back.

                          DEBORAH

                Oh, good. Do you speak English?

                             HISPANIC MAN

                Yes, I do.

                          DEBORAH

                Would you translate for me?
     He looks at Flor..my God.

                          HISPANIC MAN

                Sure...forever.
     He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment.
     Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish.."Would you please
     just find out what she wants." Evelyn joins them.

                          DEBORAH

                Wait till I say something before
                you start in..
                    (he looks at her)
                I rented a house here for the
                summer and now she must sleep at
                the house because of the bus
                schedule.
     He translates along with Deborah's speech.

     ON FLOR.

     Stricken. She turns to Deborah.

                          FLOR

                No.. Sorry.

                             DEBORAH

                What? Why?
     Flor talks briefly in Spanish.

                          HISPANIC MAN

                She can't because of her daughter.

                          DEBORAH

                You have a daughter? You have a
                whole daughter you haven't
                mentioned..How old?

                             FLOR

                Twelve.




                                                        57.








                     DEBORAH

              (to Evelyn)
          It's a little crazy that I don't
          know that.
The man translates.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (to man)
          Don't translate asides.
The man says in Spanish to Flor.."You work for her?"--Flor
answers, "just tell her that I can't live here." Deborah
doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation.

                      DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Hey!

                    HISPANIC MAN

          She can't live here. Her daughter.

                    DEBORAH

          Okay..
              (beat then big decision)
          Her daughter can also live with us
          for the summer..
The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah..

                     FLOR

              (big decision)
          No, sorry.

                      DEBORAH

          Why?
The man asks Flor who speaks in Spanish..

                    HISPANIC MAN

          I don't know. She just doesn't want
          to.

                    DEBORAH

          Will you please just tell me what
          she said.

                    HISPANIC MAN

          She said, "I just don't want to."

                    EVELYN

          If she didn't tell us about her
          child she has to have a deep sense
          of privacy. We can figure out how
          she can still live at home. Hell, I
          don't mind driving her at night.




                                                             58.








                         DEBORAH

               Let's spare the world you on the
               roads.
                   (to Flor)
               Well, what do we do?
     The Hispanic man translates the last sentence. Deborah and
     Flor stare at each other..Deborah's next words are somber and
     have enough body language to transcend the need for
     translation...the jig is up.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (big decision)
               I'm sorry, my friend, this is what
               I need. It's just for the summer. I
               don't want to lose you. But ....
     Flor indicates there is no need to translate. A beat.

                         FLOR

                   (enormous decision)
               Yo vivo aquÌ.

                         HISPANIC MAN

               She'll live here.
     The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to
     walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to
     actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before
     Deborah can admonish him.

                         HISPANIC MAN (CONT'D)

               I said, "God protect you from that
               boss."

87   EXT. FLOR'S APT. COMPLEX - DAY                               87

     As Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down
     the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant.
     Flor follows tight lipped - resolved. They each carry many
     clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls on the balcony
     literally cheer Cristina on.

                         BALCONY GIRLS

                   (accented)

               MAL-----I------BU!

     Cristina grins hugely back at them.

88   INT. MALIBU TUNNEL - DAY                                     88

     The two women in the truck and then..

89   INT. TRUCK - DAY.                                            89

     As the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and
     waves..Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes
     never leave her.




                                                             59.







     She gasps frequently..MAJOR GIANT ORGANIC GASPS OF WONDER AND
     PLEASURE..This is awe as an active physical exercise. The
     MOVING SHOT dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter
     relationship as the TWO SHOT finds Flor becoming first
     blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over
     each new sight.

                         NARRATOR

                   (over this incidental
                    dialogue)
               The first time one sees natural
               beauty which is owned by others
               confounds the senses.. I had never
               imagined the word "money" could be
               associated with anything but the
               anxiety of not having enough. I
               didn't know God had a toy store for
               the rich.

90   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - STREET SIDE - DAY                 90

     The truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front
     door into a court yard.

91   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - BEACH SIDE - DAY                  91

     Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to CHUM in the manner of
     people trying to excite dogs.

                         GEORGIE

               Who wants to go swimming?..Yes, who
               wants to go swimming?
     The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine
     year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning
     herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same
     way. Evelyn has a drink in hand..

                         GEORGIE (CONT'D)

                   (to grandmother)
               Who wants to go swimming?..Huh..

                         EVELYN

               Not now..But I promise I'll go in
               the summer after next.
     John enters the scene..

                         JOHN

               You want to go swimming?

                         GEORGIE

               Oh yeah, you're off.

                         JOHN

               What do you think, wet suits?




                                                              60.








                         GEORGIE

               Wet suits are for wimps..

                         JOHN

               Yeah, you're right..let me get
               mine..
     Georgie laughs..

                         GEORGIE

                   (to Dad)
               You're good.

92   INT./EXT. HALLWAY / PATIO - DAY                              92

     Behind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and
     their destiny....Flor behind her daughter.

     REVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA.

     As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house.

     VERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH

     As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter
     her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in
     the background.
     Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a
     shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and
     emits a small, prescient moan.

                         DEBORAH

                   (to Flor)
               Look at this child..Flor, you could
               make a fortune at surrogate
               pregnancy....
     Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what
     Deborah said..

                         FLOR

               Que?
     Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.

                         JOHN

               Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you.
                   (to Flor indicating
                    Cristina)
               Great..

                         DEBORAH

                   (to Cristina)
               Hi. This is my daughter,
               Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out
               there...are Georgie and.




                                                        61.







As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has
almost reached them ..

                    EVELYN

          I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan
          of your mother's.

                    CRISTINA

          I'm Cristina.
As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top
which is half tucked in.

                    BERNICE

              (kidding around but right
               on)
          No comparisons, please, no
          comparisons.
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self-
deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish.

                    CRISTINA

          My mother says it's best if we get
          out of the way and put our things
          away.

                    JOHN

          Have you ever been to the beach
          here?

                    CRISTINA

          I've never been anyplace but Mexico
          and Texas.....before today.
John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with
beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards.

                    JOHN

          Here's the most important place in
          the house..grab this stuff whenever
          you want.

                    CRISTINA

              (delighted)
          Thank you..thank you so much.

                    DEBORAH

          Very little accent?

                       FLOR

                 (suspiciously)
          Que?

                    CRISTINA

              (to Flor)
          Sin acento.




                                                                62.







     Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with,
     nods.

                           CRISTINA (CONT'D)

                     (to Deborah)
                 Thank you..there's an A.P. total
                 fluency class where they work you
                 pretty hard at sounding American.
     Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended
     conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a
     word.

                              FLOR

                 Cristina..

                           DEBORAH

                 Right. Settle in..

                           CRISTINA

                 Thank you. I am thrilled to be
                 here.

93   INT. MAID'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                 93

     Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual
     brilliance...Flor is tense..distraught...her daughter
     giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of
     towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go
     swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of
     being here...the spirit of the kid such that Flor relents....

94   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                         94

     Flor and Cristina, two sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights
     from the beach homes.

     OTHER ANGLE.

     John and Georgie in the waves..body surfing...they get to
     shore...John sees the two females..dashing in the water in
     their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave
     as they run in...then once they are in he starts taking off
     his wet suit hurriedly...

     ON JOHN..

     As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment.

95   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT                95

     Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking
     out.

96   INT. MASTER BEDROOM                                          96

     As Deborah steps out on the deck and sees Cristina.




                                                                63.








                            DEBORAH

                      (in a loud whisper)
                  Hey, Cristina...hey...hey..What are
                  you doing up?
     Cristina looks around -- then up..

                            CRISTINA

                  Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just
                  excited.

                            DEBORAH

                  I know..Would you believe I had to
                  talk my husband into this?
                      (no reply/then more
                       pointedly)
                  Would you believe I had to talk my
                  husband into it?...do you hear me?

                            CRISTINA

                  Yes...I just ..
                      (awash..a shy laugh)
                  I didn't know what to say?

                            DEBORAH

                      (still calling down)
                  Do you want to come with me? -- I'm
                  going to the flea market.

                            CRISTINA

                  I don't know what that...

                            DEBORAH

                  It's the Rose Bowl... miles, actual
                  miles, of great things for sale for
                  God's sake...We can have brunch in
                  Pasadena.

                            CRISTINA

                  I don't want to wake my mother so
                  early.

                            DEBORAH

                  I'll leave her a note...I'll

     As Flor wakes..looks around.

                              FLOR

                  Cristina?
     She goes to Cristina's bed...atop the bed is a note. She
     picks it up.

     INSERT..THE NOTE

     Dear Flor,




                                                             64.







     I decided to steal your daughter for a bit.

     LOVE,


     DEBORAH

     With great energy born of bottled fury, Flor begins to go
     through her daughter's things...finding her backpack and
     extracting a Spanish/English dictionary.

     INSERT DICTIONARY.

     As her finger points to:
     "Steal...robar"
     And then she flips some pages feverishly..Her finger
     indicating:
     "daughter .... hija"

98   EXT. PCH - EARLY AFTERNOON.                                 98


                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Stop thanking me. I love having the
               company.

                         CRISTINA

               It was an adventure which I'll
               remember.

                         DEBORAH

               Your English is genius. Do you
               dream in Spanish or English?

                         CRISTINA

               Just recently I've had a dream in
               English.

                         DEBORAH

               What was it?

                         CRISTINA

               I am so sorry. I -- uh..I'd ..I uh,
               can't tell ..This is so
               uncomfortable.

                         DEBORAH

               You could have just said you didn't
               remember.

                         CRISTINA

               I, uh, guess so..but I do.

                         DEBORAH

               Look who's sensational.




                                                              65.

      Evelyn is sitting on the patio making sangria..Flor enters.
      She is pissed.

                          EVELYN

                What's wrong?
      She shows her the letter. Evelyn reads it and hands it
      back..She is about to offer something..Flor waves it off and
      enters the house..John comes in from the beach with his
      kids..boogie boards...Evelyn hands him the letter..

                          EVELYN (CONT'D)

                She's wild-eyed over this..
      John moves after Flor as Bernie reads the letter..

                           BERNICE

                Aw, shit..
                    (then quickly)
                Sorry about the word, Georgie.

                             GEORGIE

                It's okay.

                          BERNICE

                You want to know what happened?

                          GEORGIE

                No thank you.

100   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                   100

      John enters..

                          JOHN

                Hey, Flor..
      She turns..

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                I'm sorry..very sorry..
      He indicates his watch -- then holds his fingers together.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                They should be back soon..
      Flor starts to cry. She sits in a chair..He sits not far from
      her.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Hey, Flor..
      Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her
      alone..she turns from him..He walks to the wet bar and gets a
      bottle of water...pours some..Her crying soft in the

background...He walks to her, sits near her and offers her
the glass of water which she takes.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            Deborah made a mistake. I
            understand how you feel...Do you
            understand me at all, generally? Is
            simpático the word?
He pats her on the back..She looks at him..

CLOSE ON FLOR..

Is he coming on?..

HER POV..

His kind eyes.

FULL SHOT..

This is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people
finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she
duplicates his gesture and pats his back.

                      FLOR

            Simpático, yes.
And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she
is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been
with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to
stop her.

                      JOHN

            Un momento, huh?
She stops and turns to him.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            I'm really sorry this is happening.
            I just want you to know that. I am
            real sorry.
He taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a
flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            I didn't mean..
He makes a gesture of ardent love..

                        JOHN (CONT'D)

            I meant..
Makes a person to person innocent gesture..She finds herself
smiling.




                                                              67.








                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Well, the good thing about being an
                idiot is that every once in a while
                you cheer people up..Got to get to
                work.

      CAMERA STAYS WITH FLOR

      As he exits...thinks about John's demeanor, smiles again,
      shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for Cristina.

101   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - SUNSET.                    101

      Deborah's SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to
      carry things in...(NOTE: Cristina's hair has been restyled.)

102   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY                        102

      Evelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All
      staring at her.

                          DEBORAH

                What? Something bad happen?

      ON CRISTINA..

      Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Cristina, tell your mother I just
                played around with your hair..she
                can put it back..no hurt feelings.

                          CRISTINA

                Not right now.
      Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and
      speaking to her forcefully in Spanish.

                           DEBORAH

                What? --

                          EVELYN

                You can't just take someone
                else's.....

                          DEBORAH

                Nuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or
                I'll go there and you know where
                "there" is.
      Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to
      Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm
      around her. A pleasant surprise..




                                                                 68.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  Can you believe what Flor is making
                  this into..Shoot me if I ever get
                  that hard to deal with.
      Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream.

103   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - EVENING                                  103

      MUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in
      Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad.
      Cristina enormously uncomfortable.

      INSERT - THE PAD.

      The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina
      winces with the words she records even while punctuating
      perfectly.

                            PAD WRITING

                  You cannot take my child without my
                  permission..And, if you had asked
                  me I would not have given
                  permission. Is this why you did not
                  ask? Because you knew this. You
                  have no rights over my private
                  life.

      ON FLOR..

      Reaching a decisive conclusion.

                            PAD

                  If you have any disagreement with
                  this, I no longer wish to work
                  here.

      ON CRISTINA'S LOOK

      This is awful news.

      ON FLOR.

      For a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's
      hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits.

104   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY          104

      Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out
      to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She
      actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.

                            DEBORAH

                  What's this?
      Flor shakes the letter at her.

      OTHER ANGLE..





                                                                69.







      Showing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage
      prompter in the wings.

                           FLOR

                For you.

                           DEBORAH

                From?
      Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own
      chest.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                You are not yourself...This was
                written in anger. You sleep on it
                and then if you still want me to
                have it -- fine..I don't think you
                will once calm and rational thought
                returns. Just sleep on it.
      Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving
      Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself
      and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we
      hear before scene's end is "mañana."

105   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING         105

      Deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running
      clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes
      off and John awakens.

                          JOHN

                She didn't even want us to know she
                had a daughter - then, on the first
                day, you take the kid without
                asking. I think that's...

                          DEBORAH

                    (starting to lose it)
                What!?! Insensitive? Elitist?
                Irresponsible? Perverse? Dizzy?

                          JOHN

                    (slow and emphatic)
                Dumb.
      She looks at him...He has been atypical...Her immediate
      emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt. Her
      words are slow...her voice ragged...

                          DEBORAH

                When is anyone in this damn house
                or this damn life going to consider
                my feelings? I just tried to make
                a lovely kid feel welcome. There's
                no reason to rake it over...I let
                it go..and gave Flor the room to
                let it go. Which I'm sure she has!
                It's over!! So get on board.




                                                              70.







      She opens the door and almost runs into Flor who is standing
      immediately in her way holding the letter.

                           FLOR

                I slept.

106   INT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DEN - DAY                     106

      Deborah stands over Cristina, who is writing in Spanish a
      note Deborah is dictating. As John passes through the room.

                          DEBORAH

                I am deeply and sincerely sorry to
                have upset you. Especially in
                light of the deep connection, as
                women, I believe us to have.

                          EVELYN

                    (sotto to John)
                And to think I was worried about
                Flor living here with her kid?

107   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - PATIO                         107

      John is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the
      overall atmosphere. IN THE BACKGROUND we see Deborah handing
      Flor her letter..Cristina taking sidelong glances...relieved
      to see them shake hands (Flor engaging), hug (Flor
      reluctant).

                          JOHN

                So here's the idea..I want to make
                a serving platter for serving fish
                using sea glass like this..
      He holds out some sea glass.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                I used to hunt for this stuff every
                free minute when I apprenticed in
                Italy. This is bits of broken glass
                that the ocean sand blasts over the
                years..great looking, huh? So you
                guys go hunting and I'll pay 50
                cents for any piece, a dollar for
                anything as big as this and five
                dollars for any color that isn't
                brown, clear or green.

                          GEORGIE

                Do we have to do this?

                          BERNICE

                    (to Georgie)
                Oh, come on...
      Georgie and Bernice start off..




                                                                 71.








                          JOHN

                Come on, Cristina - go get em.
      Her eyes widen and off she runs, intoxicated with being
      included and having the chance to make money.

108   EXT. BEACH - DAY - VARIOUS SHOTS                            108

      The kids combing through pebbles.
      Georgie becoming bored and stopping..
      Bernie stopping.

109   EXT. BEACH - SAME SCENE - SUNSET..                          109

      Lots of people on their decks..hot-tubbing, sunning,
      partying..rich people forming New Yorker cartoons in the
      background as Cristina continues to doggedly collect her sea
      glass. At one point, she comes upon a teenage couple making
      out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll
      over so she can search the area.

110   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN                                 110

      Cristina arising..

111   EXT. BEACH - PRE-DAWN..                                     111

      Cristina collecting sea glass.

112   EXT. BEACH - SAME SCENE - NIGHT.                            112

      Illuminated by the surf lights of the beach homes, Cristina
      plugs away.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


113   EXT. CLASKY'S RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.          113

      John exits his door and steps to his car..as he is about to
      get in..

                             CRISTINA'S VOICE

                Excuse me.
      He looks up and steps around to where she is...there is a
      battered wood table along the side of the house.

                          JOHN

                Hi..what's doing?
      She overturns a large bucket and a small mountain of sea
      glass spills on the table.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)

                I'm broke.




                                                     72.








                    CRISTINA

              (feeling horrible)
          No..you don't have to pay..I'm
          sorry. Don't worry, please.

                    JOHN

          No. I'm kidding..Instead of a
          platter -- I'll just build a sea
          glass building and serve fish
          inside... Great, Cristina..Why
          don't you count it and..

                    CRISTINA

          I have... Many times..I didn't
          sleep. I counted.

                    JOHN

          So what's the damage...total?
Her eyes locked on his.

                    CRISTINA

              (dead serious)
          It depends on whether you consider
          these four a color other than
          green, brown or clear..
She takes them from her pocket.

                    JOHN

          Well, this one is borderline.

                     CRISTINA

          I agree.

                    JOHN

          Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody
          finds a blue..You know how a blue
          happens? I mean, before the ocean
          blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody
          had to throw away an old Milk of
          Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk
          of Magnesia is?

                    CRISTINA

          Unfortunately.
He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her.

                    JOHN

          So how much for the whole deal?

                    CRISTINA

              (unable to look at him)
          Eleven hundred and one dollar.
He reacts..then..




                                                                73.








                          JOHN

                Okay. We'll finish dealing with it
                when I get home from work.
      She gasps..

114   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - ONE A.M.                                114

      Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears
      John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.

115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115

      As she enters from the back room and sees that John is
      walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on
      which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it.

116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116

      John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will
      be late. He is disappointed.

117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117

      Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out
      a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding
      it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity...

                             FLOR

                Cristina..
      She turns...the wad of money in her hand..

118   INT. POCKET KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                           118

      The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a
      salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as
      a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and
      copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a
      guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...

119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119

      He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just
      about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish
      voices approaching. He looks up.

      ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA

      As they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words.

                          CRISTINA

                My mother wishes me to represent
                exactly what she says, nothing
                else.




                                                         74.







And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in
Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is
not only a translation but a reenactment.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          May I talk to you?

                    JOHN

          You mean your mother....
Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

              (looking at Flor)
          Sure you can talk to me..
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish..

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I don't have to sleep first?

                    JOHN

          What's wrong?
Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          Did you give this money to my
          daughter?

                    JOHN

          I made this little deal..with all
          the kids to...

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

              (interrupting)
          Please..
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now
translates from the background.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)

          You don't tell or ask the mother
          when you give a child a fortune for
          looking on the beach for
          stones..what is the word for this..

                       JOHN

          Sea glass?
On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor
turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him.




                                                           75.








                      CRISTINA AS FLOR

            No..not a name for the stones..a
            name for the act..what you did..

ON FLOR..

As she spits out the word to her daughter.

                        FLOR

            EngreÌdo.

ON JOHN..

As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear.

                      JOHN

            Oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be
            rough.

ON CRISTINA..

Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to
deliver the word.

                      CRISTINA

                (briefly being herself)
            It's hard to translate.
She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.

                        CRISTINA AS FLOR

            Smug.
John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John

                      JOHN

            I had no idea it would amount to
            that kind of money..I thought ---
            sort of tops fifty dollars.

                      CRISTINA AS FLOR

            Fifty dollars is a lot of money..

                      JOHN

            Okay. Right.
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..

                       JOHN (CONT'D)

                (sighing to himself)
            Ah, shit..
That fast Cristina translates.. Before Flor can react. John
talks directly to Flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.




                                                           76.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry....I get why you are
          upset. It might not look it but I
          am good at getting things. Doing
          something about it is something
          else..I was going to talk to you
          before I actually gave her the
          money..but maybe I should have
          checked before I started the whole
          thing.
              (he smiles/they don't)
          I know what it's like when you feel
          your kid is being messed with..I
          get the message. It won't happen
          again. It's late..I'm sure we'd all
          like...
Flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          To what..sleep? If this was small
          enough to be helped by some little
          apology, I would be a fool to bring
          it up..I need to say more no matter
          what the result. I need to be
          impolite. You leave someone else's
          child alone. It's simple, no? It
          is too easy for children to feel
          contradictions..It encourages
          questioning their parents..and that
          makes them less safe. Your wife
          takes her for rides and changes her
          hair..You give her money. Here..
              (this next sentence
               Cristina translates with
               alarm and adds her own
               question mark.)
          Take back the money????????????
Flor hands John the envelope under her daughter's wrenching
gaze. They begin to exit..but Flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter. Her voice softens.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)

          I did not mean to be angry to you -
          only emotional..
They turn to leave. John speaks with sudden volume and
muscle.

                    JOHN

          What about hypocritical?
Cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a
translation and she complies.. Flor then wearing the same
confused expression.




                                                        77.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Yeah, you heard me. It's not like
          you didn't do the same thing...

                      FLOR

                (hard on the translation)
          No!

                    JOHN

          Oh, yes. So go lecture
          yourself..you won't need a
          translator for that one...I mean
          what am I lately... A recycling
          bin?..just anyone dump in your
          garbage and hope I make something
          useful out of it...
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Yes, you did the same thing...you
          think I didn't know about altering
          those outfits for Bernie..She tells
          me her stuff....So, am I missing
          something? Is there a real
          difference between that and what
          you are complaining about?
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translate..but doesn't get one..Instead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the
face.

                    FLOR

          Sin diferencia. Yo interferÌ.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          No difference. I interfered.

                    JOHN

          Okay......I'm still not sure I did
          the right thing keeping it to
          myself. It felt disloyal to
          Deborah..but my daughter really
          needed someone to be kind to her
          right then..so..so.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I am very embarrassed. You are very
          right. Hypocrisy..yes.




                                                        78.








                    JOHN

              (something strikes him, he
               softens, disoriented)
          I'll tell you, it's pretty wild to
          say something and have the other
          person just concede the point. I'm
          dazed here.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I will leave whenever it is good
          for you and...

                    JOHN

          No..no..come on, man..

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          But how can I work for you after we
          talk like this?

                    JOHN

          You can't quit even if you want to
          and you know why.

                    FLOR

          No..

                    JOHN

          Yes, you do..
Flor is worried as John looks right at her..Is he coming on?

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Because then Cristina will blame
          herself for costing you the
          job...and that guilt...I don't know
          if you know about guilt..
Cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.

                     CRISTINA

          Culpa, guilt, sÌ. We know. We are
          Catholics.

                    FLOR

              (after her daughter's
               translation)
          Culpa, si..Por Dios, Si.

                    CRISTINA

              (on her own)
          We know.

                    FLOR

              (big nod)
          We know.
John gestures that there is nothing to be done. Flor nods.




                                                              79.








                          JOHN

                So, welcome back.
      She smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake.

                          FLOR

                Good night, Mr. Clasky..

                          CRISTINA

                Good night As they exit..their
                backs to John, daughter following
                mother...Flor speaks to her
                daughter.

                          FLOR

                    (an aside)
                No te puedo tener haciendo esto por
                mi. Ahora tengo que aprender
                inglÈs.

                          CRISTINA AS FLOR

                    (over her shoulder to John
                     as they move)
                I can't have you doing this for me.
                I must learn English now.

                          FLOR

                No, dije eso por ti - no por John.
      That translates to "No, I meant that for you, not John." But
      Cristina does not translate the line. Nor..

                          JOHN

                You have a wonderful mother.

                          FLOR

                Que?

                          CRISTINA

                Nada.

120   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 120

      A Spanish commercial for learning English in a hurry is on
      television..Flor on the phone ordering it..

                          NARRATOR

                Learning English would cost five
                hundred and ninety nine dollars
                down and 15 monthly payments of one
                hundred and ten dollars...which
                represents 48 percent
                interest..Mexicans marketing
                Mexicans. But not a penny was
                wasted.




                                                                80.








121   EXT. MAIL BOX - DAY                                        121

      As Flor takes a package from the box.

                          NARRATOR

                My mother showed an extraordinary
                facility for learning the language.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


122   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY                      122

      Flor listening to the tapes as she does laundry.

                          NARRATOR

                ..as well as a totally committed,
                obsessive work ethic, which blocked
                out all else..She was her
                daughter's mother.
      As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a
      tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she
      takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm,
      a beat too late that she has broken the rule.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


123   EXT. BEACH - LATE AT NIGHT                                 123

      Flor sitting on the sand...listening to her
      tapes..continually forced by Chum's obsessive persistence to
      throw him the ball.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


124   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              124

      As John arrives...He bumps the walls on entering.

125   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              125

      As John enters the house, clearly drunk.   There is the sound
      of skittering paws as CHUM approaches.

                          JOHN

                    (cheering)
                Hey, boy, I can use some up
                company.
      But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of
      furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John
      follows, weaving a bit.

126   INT. BEACH HOUSE - DEN - LATE NIGHT                        126

      As John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to
      Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses
      the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she
      sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament.




                                                        81.




When she speaks English, at this point, her words are
halting.

                    JOHN

          You gotta do something about
          Chum..Your arm's going to go.
She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of
his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor
wearily throws it.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Don't you sleep anymore?

                    FLOR

          No..You get more if you keep at it.

                    JOHN

          You're doing fantastic.

                    FLOR

          Now I am like a three year-old.
          Your wife go out.

                    JOHN

          She say where?

                    FLOR

          No.
              (on his reaction)
          Sorry.

                    JOHN

          Listen..I just forgot she was going
          out..don't be a smart ass.
              (jolted by his own remark)
          Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate
          mostly in apologies anyway..I'm
          sorry. I should be whipped. I
          should be stoned- it's been a while
          - I meant to say, I think, don't be
          smart, don't be kind, don't be
          sensitive, don't be beautiful. I
          meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night
          Flor..that show you're watching is
          going to be a hit."
He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and
then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant,
but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master.
Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of
John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the
picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and
purposefully goes back to her lessons.




                                                              82.








127   EXT. P.C.H. - LA SALSA FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY.            127

      Cristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast food
      place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male
      figure on its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV.

                          BERNICE

                How'd you get your mother to let
                you go with my mother?

                          CRISTINA

                Well, your mother just said she
                could use my help on a few errands
                while you're in class...
      Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans.

                          CRISTINA (CONT'D)

                What?

                          BERNICE

                No. Just that I hate summer school.

                          CRISTINA

                Why do you go then?

                          BERNICE

                    (looks at her)
                I'm not sure I can explain to you
                the concept of not doing well in a
                class..in this case math...and the
                system kind of insists on the
                illusion that you've learned math --
                so they make you go to summer
                school..It helps them avoid facing
                that they have failed in their
                mission.

                          CRISTINA

                What do you mean they failed?

                          BERNICE

                Joking.

                          CRISTINA

                Oh. I see. Forgive me, I don't have
                a real sense of humor.

                          BERNICE

                    (looking skyward)
                Thank you, God.
                    (on Cristina's reaction)
                Joking...

                          CRISTINA

                The joke is?




                                                                83.







      As they get in the car..Bernice doing a little stutter step
      offering Cristina the front seat..Cristina demurs.

128   INT. SUV - DAY.                                            128

      As they get in..Deborah privy to the conversation now.

                          BERNICE

                That you're better at everything
                than I am...and I was thanking God
                for there being this one thing
                where I might have my nose in
                front.
      Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could
      possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled.

                          DEBORAH

                And that thing is???
      Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother.

                          BERNICE

                Sexual experience..
      Cristina laughs.

                          BERNICE (CONT'D)

                    (ruefully to self)
                That one even she knows is funny.
      Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind.
      Deborah, for some reason, feels she deserves credit for their
      connection.

                          DEBORAH

                Look at you girls.

129   INT. BEACH BEDROOM - DAY                                   129

      Deb working an outfit..her mother eyeing her..

                          DEBORAH

                Cristina's already read, on her
                own, everything on Bernice's summer
                reading list..And she's two grades
                behind..Imagine if she went to
                Bernice's school..And they'd kill
                to give her a scholarship.

                          EVELYN

                Talk to Flor...

                          DEBORAH

                    (sarcastic)
                Yeah..she's so open to new things.




                                                              84.








130   EXT. GORGEOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL -DAY.                          130

      Deborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking
      lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her
      focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. She is
      clearly stalling.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Can't find my keys..
      Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her..

                             ARLENE

                Deborah...

                          DEBORAH

                    (acting surprised)
                Hi, Arlene..
                    (to Cristina)
                Come on.
      They walk to greet Arlene.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Hi. This is Cristina..the girl I'm
                always raving about..This is Arlene
                Folsom..the school director.

                             ARLENE

                Hi..

                          CRISTINA

                    (Barbara Boxer couldn't do
                     it better)
                Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms.
                Folsom. I couldn't believe how
                beautiful the grounds were as we
                drove in. I just think the balance
                of the buildings to open ground is
                so wonderful and must have been
                very difficult to achieve.
      Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression
      Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults
      suspiciously so...sharing their delight.

                          ARLENE

                Would you like a little tour?

      MOVING CAMERA..

      First showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop
      Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we
      MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her reaction.




                                                              85.








                          NARRATOR

                The experience was literally mind
                boggling. My mind did boggle. My
                cranial cells stunned. Even if I
                had enough sense of wonder to
                imagine such a school existed; my
                sense of fairness made it
                unthinkable that any school could
                offer this much more than my own..

131   INT. BEACH LIVING ROOM - DAY                             131

      This is the last day of the summer rental - many packed
      cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a
      momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and
      quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the
      motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum,
      rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we
      maintain focus on the momentous conversation.)

                          DEBORAH

                Nuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning
                this one on me. I've got to finish
                packing up.

                          FLOR

                    (no longer sure of herself
                     or anything)
                I just don't....Out of space this
                school wants her to go for free?

                          DEBORAH

                We ran into the school head. They
                want diversity...Cristina knocked
                her out...I had nothing to do with
                it. By the way, the scholarship is
                worth twenty thousand dollars. And
                early registration is tomorrow.

                          FLOR

                It is too far from our home.

                          DEBORAH

                You could move in with us in town.

                          FLOR

                Never, thank you...

                          DEBORAH

                Okay, then don't..By the way..the
                phrase is "NO, thank you."

132   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 132

      Flor has her earphones on listening to her English tapes..but
      she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter
      passionately pray in English..soon taking off the ear phones.




                                                              86.








                          CRISTINA

                Please, dear God..Enter my mother's
                heart and make her understand what
                this school would mean.

                          FLOR

                Alright. I look.

                          CRISTINA

                Amen.

133   EXT. L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOL - FLOR AT CRISTINA'S SCHOOL - DAY 133

      Summer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent Hispanic.
      Through Flor's POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn
      but as vibrant with community.

134   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - FLOR AT BERNICE'S SCHOOL - DAY     134

      Highly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale
      students..five percent Latino...No brochure can do it
      justice. Overwhelmed by the implications, Flor's eyes tear.

135   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT                            135

      Cristina sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep.

136   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                            136

      John enters, home from work ... as he passes Flor's door it
      opens and she steps out. Before she can continue on, she sees
      Evelyn at the foot of the stairs, carrying a glass of port.

                          EVELYN

                Hi, Flor, want some port?

                          FLOR

                No, thank you, Evelyn.

                          EVELYN

                    (going up stairs)
                Thanks for never judging me..Love
                you. Love everybody. That's what's
                killing me.. Sleep well.

      EVELYN'S POV.

      She sees Flor approach John. Evelyn looks thoughtful.

137   INT. DEN - LATE NIGHT                                    137

      John is about to pour himself a stiff drink. Flor startles
      him.

                          FLOR

                May I talk with you?




                                                              87.








                           JOHN

                Me?
                    (she nods)
                Deborah will be home soon. I just
                talked to her.

                          FLOR

                I need real talk..Is it okay?
      John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                No?

                           JOHN

                Sure.

                          FLOR

                Outside? Private?

                          JOHN

                Sure.....
                    (as they exit to beach
                     with a nervous laugh)
                You have me a little worried...
      He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are
      not.

138   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                       138

      He sits..she stands, gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically
      blowing her dress against her body. He tries not to notice.

                          FLOR

                You know about Cristina and your
                great school?

                          JOHN

                Oh, it's happened. Is it driving
                you nuts?

                          FLOR

                Yes, nuts. I have no idea what to
                do. Such an important thing.

                           JOHN

                Yeah.

                It's a good school?

                          JOHN

                Tops. It's tops.

                          FLOR

                So you like it?




                                                        88.








                    JOHN

          No. I hate the damn school. But
          that's because they keep sending my
          daughter home anxiety-ridden,
          mostly over geometry..I mean you
          "get" Bernice..In a decent world
          her school should let her know how
          great she is, right?

                    FLOR

          Very right.

                    JOHN

          So, don't ask me..I'm worried about
          my own kid there.

                    FLOR

          You don't have to worry about
          Bernice. Nothing is going to change
          that heart.
He looks at her..Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone
echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about
his daughter..It is odd..being this deeply touched before he
knows what hit him..He makes little adjustments until the
moment passes..

                     JOHN

          Um.....yeah..thanks...
              (then)
          It's great to hear someone else say
          that out loud..Hard to explain.

                    FLOR

          I "get" it.

                    JOHN

              (a beat..then deeply, with
               core feelings, a lament)
          Ah, man..

                    FLOR

              (caring)
          It will be okay.

                    JOHN

          No, I was thinking about you..

                    FLOR

              (instantly alarmed)
          Your, "Ah, man" was for me? You
          think I am in trouble with
          Cristina?

                    JOHN

          It's just tough to be sane.

          To know you're not just making
          something out of nothing. That when
          you think you're at some
          crossroads - you are.

                    FLOR

              (she takes this in/nods)
          ....I never know a man who can put
          himself in my place like you do.
          How do you become that man?

                    JOHN

          I don't know...You introduce two
          Jews in the desert and wait five
          thousand years. Then, bingo,
          somebody else who can see trouble
          coming but can't do anything about
          it.

                    FLOR

          I don't understand.

                    JOHN

          That's okay.

                       FLOR

          I want to.

                    JOHN

          Nothing. I don't know what I'm
          talking about..
A sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way
which cannot be ignored.

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

          Will you sit down.. Get out of the
          damn wind.
She sits. It helps.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          So you going to send her?

                    FLOR

          I don't know. But it does not feel
          good. I think if she goes there it
          will be one of two things..either
          she will be odd...or she will make
          herself the same as them.

                    JOHN

              (in wonderment)
          That is EXACTLY the way I felt
          about Bernice going there..Exactly.

                I wasn't able to think it that
                clearly...But that's how I felt. So
                between odd and the same...you
                gotta root for odd, don't you?

                          FLOR

                Yes, you gotta.
      Camera begins to pull back...early in the move John's words
      stop the movement.

                          JOHN

                This was a crummy summer.
      Flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.

                          FLOR

                Not all crummy.
      Suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly,
      changing mode.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Thank you, good night. I go sleep.

                          JOHN

                Good night..Hey?
      She turns..

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                You speaking English...It's, uh..

                          FLOR

                What?

                          JOHN

                Nothing. Just.... Nice meeting you.
      She gulps and exits...as the CAMERA PULLS BACK..ending the
      summer at the rented house...as we transition to....

139   EXT. BIG BLUE BUS IN MOTION - MORNING.                    139

      Through the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina.
      Flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in
      her body. Cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an
      incandescent turn. Quite a contrast.

140   EXT. STONE CANYON AND SUNSET - MORNING                    140

      As the bus stops...Bernice is across the street, along with
      some other kids and Deborah, who is wearing her running
      clothes..Flor and Cristina exit the bus...




                                                        91.








                    BERNICE

              (calling)
          You just made it...I was getting
          worried..
Deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to
Cristina..

                     DEBORAH

          I picked up your books yesterday..
              (by way of explanation to
               Flor)
          This is one of Bernie's
          old..ancient backpacks.
Cristina taking it...

                    CRISTINA

          Oh, thank you..
As she shoulders it and almost falls over..

                    CRISTINA (CONT'D)

              (impressed with the heft)
          This is a great school.

                    DEBORAH

              (to Cristina)
          I got you a little first-day-at-a-
          new-school present...
A school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain
deadline pressure on the transaction.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          It's from me and....Bernice.
              (to Flor)
          Okay? It is a big day.
Flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes.

                    BERNICE

              (dry)
          What did we get her?
Deborah hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's
expression.

                     DEBORAH

               (to Cristina)
          It's from ALL of us. Your mother
          too.

                    FLOR

              (to Cristina)
          It's not from me...




                                                                 92.







      Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction
      as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board
      the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women,
      thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her
      daughter.

                          DEBORAH

                Have a great year, girls..
                    (for Flor)
                This is so great. It fills your
                heart, doesn't it?
      Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up
      the hill..

141   EXT. STREET - HILL - ANGLE ON FLOR...                       141

      Walking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own
      fury..Deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor
      keeps walking toward the camera..

                          NARRATOR

                There is a terrible crisis which
                comes when your own personality is
                not equal to the challenge you
                face. When being who you are no
                longer works.
      Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls
      for a clear path well in advance.

                          DEBORAH

                Left...left.
      Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk
      faster...

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Left...left...
      Deborah is close behind now.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)


                LEFT!

      Suddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is lithe and quick.

      ON DEBORAH...

      A blink of confusion...then something resembling innate
      satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the Race is on.

      ANGLE AS DEBORAH DRAWS ABREAST OF FLOR.

      Strangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. She is
      genuinely warm.




                                                              93.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                      (to Flor)
                  Why am I not surprised you're
                  competitive?
      Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck.

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  Oh, they're delivering my table.
      Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win
      so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's
      everything...

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  You are fast.. Better pace yourself
                  though..
      Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it
      all out...

      ON DEBORAH..

      Realizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned
      as she goes after the rabbit.

      OTHER ANGLE.

      Showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance...

      VARIOUS SHOTS..

      Flor fueled by desperation. Deborah, relentlessly gaining,
      exhilarated.

      THE FINISH..

      Decidedly anti-climactic..Deborah draws even -- passes her--
      arrives at the house with a large margin of victory.

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                      (calling back)
                  I love you for trying.

142   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                  142

      She exits into her home.

      ON FLOR..

      Bent over, hands on knees, sweaty, gasping for breath. Flor
      finally straightens up and, there being no other course,
      continues her walk up the hill, to work.

143   INT. CLASKY HOME - NIGHT...                              143

      As John moves past Evelyn on his way to work. She looks at
      him a little wild-eyed as they both stand in the doorway.
      Straining a bit for breath.

                          JOHN

                You feel okay?

                          EVELYN

                No. I've given up drinking.
                    (he looks at her/she sadly
                     nods affirmation)
                I had to do it John..I need every
                brain cell to watch out for all of
                us..given the current climate.
                Anyway. John, I think you're great
                and I'm going to act accordingly.

                           JOHN

                    (totally confused)
                Good deal.

                          EVELYN

      Flor cooking alongside Monica --- a table is set for ten..A
      banner proclaiming BIENVENIDA, MAMÁ.

                My great Aunt Monica had finally
                managed to get her mother to Los
                Angeles and my mother was making a

                I was with my friends who had
                helped me understand real optimism.
      As they pull in the driveway. Cristina and her friends exit
      the car and squeal loudly at each other with the excitement
      of having it all. Bernice exits last. She is not squealing.




                                                              95.








146   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - NIGHT                                146

      As Deb finishes dialing a call..Cristina looking on...her two
      friends watching a movie in the family room. A clock
      prominently reads nine p.m.

                              DEBORAH

                       (into phone)
                   Flor? Deb..Look, sorry to call you
                   so late, but they're still studying
                   and I'm going out but I promised to
                   get her back so if you want me to
                   cut off the school work,
                   fine...whatever you want me to do.
                   Well, okay..you think about it..
                       (she holds on to give Flor
                        time)
                   And hey, if you're tired, or want
                   to play, let her sleep here and
                   I'll get her back there tomorrow.
                   You still want to think about it?
                   Okay..
      She hangs up...and exchanges a mischievous look with
      Cristina.

                   Though it is possible to judge
                   harshly my conduct toward my mother
                   in my first year at school; almost
                   all professional literature excuses
                   my behavior as developmental, since
                   I was entering an age where
                   rebellion and narcissism were to be
                   expected. And I was being mentored.
      Monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the
      bride from an earlier scene and some of the girls who saw
      Cristina off to Malibu..Women cooking in the kitchen..She
      tells the girls, in Spanish, that Cristina may not make it.
      They are disappointed...Flor thinks - then says something to
      Monica who nods in agreement. Flor exits.

      As Evelyn stands there...a little in the shadows..

      HER POV...

      Deborah somewhat dolled up moving through the interior of the
      house..




                                                                96.

                    (calling out)
                Wait!
      Deborah turns, startled.

                          EVELYN (CONT'D)

                I need to talk to you privately,
                honey.

                          DEBORAH

                "Honey?"-- Can't now, Mom...I'm
                late..I was looking all over for
                you...keep an eye on the kids. You
                know my secret cell number.

                          EVELYN

                Just give me a moment to talk
                here..

                          DEBORAH

                What is it? Are you buzzed?

                          EVELYN

                No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.
                    (on Deborah's reaction)
                Yes. Nobody noticed -- which shows
                I probably conducted myself pretty
                well as a drunk. But duty called
                and I'm sober so may I say just one
                thing.

                          DEBORAH

                One thing..go ahead...

                          EVELYN

                Thanks..Deborah, you're going to
                lose your husband and you'll never
                find someone as good. There will
                only be men who you know are cheap
                and shallow and have no real warmth
                in their souls. You may have gotten
                by on those surfaces once but now
                you've been spoiled by a good man
                and you can no longer glide on such
                thin ice. If you do not act
                quickly you will soon cement an
                awful fate for yourself. A life,
                with no hope of repair, which has
                already begun to turn desperate and
                dumb. That's it. Drive safely.
      She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the
      house.




                                                                 97.








                            EVELYN (CONT'D)

                      (to herself)
                  If we're out of coffee, it's over
                  for me.
      Suddenly a sharp horn is heard..Evelyn jumps..then turns to
      see her daughter calling to her from the driver's seat of the

      SUV..


                            DEBORAH

                  You've done it again, Mom, made me
                  hate myself..One of the things I
                  can count on..

                            EVELYN

                  Honey, lately your low self-esteem
                  is just good common sense.
      Deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before
      she drives off..

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


150   EXT. STONE CANYON - LATE NIGHT...                           150

      Flor walking from the beginning of the hill........She looks
      off to see John's vehicle approaching..She brightens..

      ON JOHN..

      Who doesn't see her..We can see his car's digital clock
      reading 11:30.

      ON FLOR..

      As he drives past her.

151   INT. CLASKY HOME - NIGHT...                                 151

      As John enters..Evelyn, in an adjoining room, moves to
      intercept him.

                            EVELYN (CONT'D)

                  John, better wait a minute.
      But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs..

                            JOHN

                      (concerned)
                  What the hell's wrong?

                            EVELYN

                  Nothing. In all futility, can I
                  urge you not to go up there.
      But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns
      at the top of the stairs WE SEE THE DOOR CLOSE TO BERNICE'S

      ROOM.





                                                              98.








      ON EVELYN..


                             EVELYN (CONT'D)

                       (to herself)
                   Denouement.

152   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT...                           152

      John enters the room on the double...passes Deborah without
      knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some
      such). As he passes....camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a
      mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings
      her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by
      goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability...

                             JOHN

                   Deb..Deb?..where are you?
      He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but
      an instinct leads her astray once more.

                                DEBORAH

                   Here I am.

                             JOHN

                   Baby, what?

                             DEBORAH

                   "Baby?" Stay there, John...Sit
                   down..I suddenly get what I have to
                   do...I just have to get the guts.

                             JOHN

                   Is it absolutely necessary to make
                   it this...this scary..can you just
                   say it?

                             DEBORAH

                   Not so easy.

                              JOHN

                       (tender/ready for the big
                         healing)
                   Yeah..come on..it's me. We can
                   talk.

                             DEBORAH

                   Do I ever hope so...I've been
                   seeing another man for the last
                   eleven weeks and it was nothing and
                   I ended it tonight..At first it was
                   just keeping an eye on the real
                   estate market..Then it was...what?
                   Me being insecure and looking for
                   some ridiculous vali...

      ON JOHN...





                                                        99.







A shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her..

                    JOHN

          Go -- hold on...hold on...I'm
          missing what you're saying..You
          can't just keep talking and expect
          me to follow it when you start the
          way you did.......

                    DEBORAH

          Just what did you hear?

                    JOHN

          Well there was the crack in the
          planet. That was noisy...
She looks at him...a solid beat...

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          There's an actual noise in my
          head.....no kidding..
Briefly he does the noise...

                    DEBORAH

              (slowly)
          I met him about...
John holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself
to hear this..She waits...and waits...as he waits he grows
flushed and stunned with dread. Finally a word..

                    JOHN

          You..
She takes that as a cue to start..

                    DEBORAH

          I met him..
He puts up his hand..

                    JOHN

          If you talk that fast...I'll never
          hear you..there's a lot going
          through my mind....Have you said
          yet whether you slept with him?

                    DEBORAH

          So far I've just been talking about
          a flirtation because the really
          important thing for you to know...

                    JOHN

          Have you said yet whether you've
          had sex with someone else? Because
          I really am missing most of your
          words. So help me out here..




                                                          100.








                    DEBORAH

          I've been trying to explain that
          for the first ten weeks there was
          almost nothing to ...

                     JOHN

              (sincerely checking but
               wild)
          You still haven't said, right?

                    DEBORAH

          Is this your way of...

                    JOHN

          This is my way of...this is my way
          of asking you whether..
He stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished
future.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Oh man, once I ask it...give me a
          second.
              (several beats then some
               conversational good
               manners for keeping her
               waiting)
          I'm just trying to figure out
          whether there's any way to avoid
          knowing..no, damn
              (quickly closing this
               argument with himself)
          There's not...
              (to her)
          Okay, you're on..real short answer,
          huh? Have you had sex with
          another..

                    DEBORAH

          I know you're very angry?

                    JOHN

              (considering/then
               repressed answer)
          Ahhhh...I'm getting there, yes.

                    DEBORAH

              (softly)
          John?
              (on his look)
          I think if you let me tell you the
          full everything of this we'd be in
          a position to deal with it
          better..because eleven weeks ago
          when...




                                                             101.








                          JOHN

                You don't believe that I miss your
                words..I get three or four
                tops...and then just see your mouth
                moving with nothing coming out and
                then I spin out and there's this
                noise...But there's no way to miss
                a "yes" or "no."

                          DEBORAH

                    (blurts)
                Yes..

                          JOHN

                    (core simple/eight years
                     old)
                Really?

                          DEBORAH

                    (this gets her)
                I made up my mind that I would
                answer every question you had..I'll
                answer anything and everything and
                more.

                          JOHN

                    (perplexed)
                What other questions could there
                be?

                          DEBORAH

                Are you really that much nicer than
                me?

                          JOHN

                Well, you don't set the bar real
                high.
      He get up and starts to exit..

                          DEBORAH

                No. Please, please, please..I
                think if you listen to exactly what
                happened and then do whatever you
                need to...we'll..just let me tell
                you everything..
      The doorbell rings...it's quite late...Deborah wondering
      what's up..she looks out the window.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Oh, it's just Flor.

153   EXT. STONE CANYON NIGHT..                                  153

      As Flor enters the Clasky House...




                                                             102.








154   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                             154

      Flor sees Evelyn in the living room.

                          EVELYN

                What are you doing here?

                          FLOR

                I want Cristina. I want to talk to
                Mrs. Clasky. I want to quit.

                          EVELYN

                I don't think you can do any of it
                right this minute..

                          FLOR

                Oh, yes..Where's Cristina?

155   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                155

      Deborah can barely look at him...

                          DEBORAH

                ...then, when I was driving back
                tonight after I ended the whole
                yuck thing..I was feeling human.
                I'm done with what's his name..a
                relief... ..and now it can be like
                it never happened and then I
                thought that the only hope was that
                I own that it did happen and that I
                take my medicine here..because if
                I'm walking around with what I did
                and you don't know what I
                did..there is a real limit to how
                close we can be..you're with me and
                I'm this person who has this bad
                secret and we aren't really on the
                same page ever again..so the reason
                I took this chance in telling -- is
                because I want us to be good..I
                want us to be close. I want to
                feel like you're not nuts to be in
                love with me..So what I think is we
                should talk till we pass out ..
                Talk till we're so sick of each
                other that there's nothing left to
                do but take the first step out of
                hell..So please let's not leave
                this room until you've heard and
                said everything..please say, okay..
      She awaits his answer..He has heard barely a few words..

                          JOHN

                What?




                                                             103.








                            DEBORAH

                  John..

                            JOHN

                  I've got to get out of
                  here..because you keep talking.
                      (as she starts to follow
                       him)
                  Stay put!
      She does. Just before he exits.

                            DEBORAH

                  You've got to say something.

                            JOHN

                  You are a terrible wife.
      He exits.

156   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              156

      Evelyn stands in the doorway with Flor..they are looking at
      Cristina and her two friends sleeping together.

                            EVELYN

                  I don't think you want to wake her
                  when you're this upset and the
                  other kids are right there and...
      Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room.

157   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                               157

      As they arrive at the interior entrance, John comes down the
      stairs just as Flor opens the front door.

                            JOHN

                  Where you going?

                            FLOR

                  I'm leaving....I have finally..

                            JOHN

                  Me too..I'll drive you.

                            FLOR

                  No.

                            JOHN

                  Yes..come on...it's past midnight
                  here.

                            FLOR

                  If you truly don't know why I say
                  "no" let me at last say the reason.
                  At least that will be a relief.
                  Have you no idea that I....




                                                             104.







      Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the
      floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's
      snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.

      OTHER ANGLE.

      As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it
      and returns.

                           JOHN

                 Look I have to get out of here
                 right now..

                           FLOR

                 Go..
      John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these
      tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                 Goodbye, Chum.
      Another toss and Flor follows John out the door.

      ON CHUM.

      No longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at
      the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor.

158   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                             158

      John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate.

                           JOHN

                     (as decisive as we've seen
                      him)
                 I'm taking you.

                           FLOR

                     (with anger)
                 Why?!?

                           JOHN

                 Because if I don't -- I'll worry
                 about you and I can't handle that
                 right now, okay?
      Flor emits a crooning sound.

                           FLOR

                 Ahhhhh.
                     (stunned and worried)
                 I never made that sound over a man
                 before..




                                                              105.







      Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the
      passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
      nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
      catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
      he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his
      solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes
      sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The
      frustration roiling in her.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                 Please!?! Mandilón.

      OTHER ANGLE..

      Deborah watching them...

      HER POV.

      Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous,
      soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.

      CLOSE ON DEBORAH..

      She trembles under the force of imminent justice.

159   INT. JOHN'S CAR - LATE NIGHT                                159

      Two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the
      car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and
      explosive shout...

                           FLOR

                     (a quick and mighty vent)
                 Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!
      For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while..

                           JOHN

                 Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me
                 that word sometime. I can really
                 use it.
      She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
      anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to
      deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out
      exponentially too forcefully.

                           FLOR

                 I quit this job!
      His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..

                           JOHN

                 I quit this job!!!!!
      As he turns onto Sunset.




                                                      106.








                    FLOR

          That's the bus stop.

                    JOHN

          I'll take you home.

                    FLOR

          No. Drop me at a bus.

                    JOHN

          Oh, shut up and stop telling me
          what to do.

                    FLOR

          Okay...then let's do something
          besides driving me home where my
          daughter isn't.

                    JOHN

          Okay..we'll do something.

                    FLOR

          And I'm supposed to figure out what
          because I'm a housekeeper and you
          don't have to think.

                    JOHN

          Oh, don't do the class thing,
          man..You don't know where I come
          from.

                    FLOR

          Alright, I know. But I can't be
          responsible no more for making sure
          nothing happens. That's another
          terrible job I quit.

                    JOHN

          What are you talking about? I take
          responsibility for anything within
          a block. You have nothing to worry
          about. That's my job.

                    FLOR

          Excellent. So you're going to
          figure out what we do, right?

                    JOHN

          Yes. Okay. Big man figure out!

                    FLOR

          Stop there.
She points to a mall..He looks at her and pulls in.




                                                              107.








160   EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - LATE NIGHT.                       160

      As she leaves the car and goes into a drug store. John, sober
      faced, looks at Flor making an attractive and zestful beeline
      toward an Hispanic market. This could be where it hits him
      that he's on a date...If so..it's too late to duck..

161   INT. MEXICAN MARKET - LATE NIGHT.                         161

      As Flor enters the market..She calls to the young shop girl
      as Marine medics for morphine.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Maquillaje!

                                                        CUT TO:

      The shop girl directs her to the make-up counter where she
      starts shopping..lip gloss, blush, eye stuff..She starts
      applying it at the check out counter.

162   EXT. OUTDOOR MALL - LATE NIGHT                            162

      As she runs back to the car.

163   INT. JOHN'S VEHICLE -                                     163

      As she enters, there is a fury to her which he almost
      matches.

                          FLOR

                This is me when I'm not working..
                You have never seen me!

                          JOHN

                Well, you look familiar.

                            FLOR

                So,
                    (parodying him)
                "man," where we heading?

                          JOHN

                I don't think I can handle public..

                          FLOR

                Yes, no...lots of people right now
                is..

                            JOHN

                I know.

                          FLOR

                You were going to figure this out!

                            JOHN

                My place!




                                                                108.








164   INT. JOHN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT...                           164

      As they enter the main restaurant...

                            FLOR

                  I've never seen your place. Very
                  perfect.
      He heads for the kitchen.

                            JOHN

                  I'm going to cook, Beautiful.
                      (on a dime correction)
                  I'm going to cook beautifully.

                            FLOR

                  Hey..please..
      He turns.

                            FLOR (CONT'D)

                  We both were not normal because we
                  are angry and we act like we are
                  angry with each other and we are
                  not..I am not. I am glad to be with
                  you. It feels comfortable to be
                  with you. If I just left the job
                  and never spoke with you it would
                  have been sin. You understand?

                            JOHN

                  Ummmmmmmmm...Yes.
      He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical
      expression, pats her on her back..She eyes him, almost
      critical about the lame extent of his aggression....He can't
      quite look at her...He pats her again..

      REAR ANGLE..THE PAT ON THE BACK.

      The pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his
      hand..she responds just a bit..

                            JOHN (CONT'D)

                  I think I'm inventing a horrible
                  new way of making out..

                            FLOR

                  Not so horrible.....
      His hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they
      both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the
      market. His hand squeezes her shoulder.

                            JOHN

                  My hand is the only sane part of my
                  body..every other part wants to
                  jump off a cliff.




                                                             109.








                           FLOR

                     (digging this/almost
                      growing a sense of humor)
                If the other hand could cheer up,
                you could lift me up and carry me
                off.
      He laughs. He takes his hand from around her. It is a bit
      awkward.

                          JOHN

                I don't know how to handle that
                one. I think I already broke my
                record for smooth.

                          FLOR

                I don't understand.

                          JOHN

                It's me. I'm not making sense. But
                I can get you fed.
      He goes to the kitchen. She begins to explore a little. She
      goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a CD player. She digs
      in her purse and takes out a CD.

165   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT                             165

      As John starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to
      his cooking...he still seethes. Then reacts as Spanish Music
      starts to play. He clears his throat as if he must make a
      speech. Then does so again..some vocal spasm paying tribute
      to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.

166   INT. RESTAURANT - DINING AREA - NIGHT...                    166

      Flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables.

167   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT...                          167

      He is cooking..He is talking to himself.

                           JOHN

                Nothing to be nervous about. You
                are not on a date...
                    (calls out)
                Hey, Flor?

                             FLOR'S VOICE (O.S.)

                Yes, John.

                          JOHN

                What are you doing?
      She enters the room...dancing a bit..




                                                       110.








                    FLOR

          Just lighting candles and picking
          music.
              (notices his cooking)
          Oooh.
She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet
dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish. He is uncomfortable
anew. The nervousness mounting.

                    JOHN

          You want a drink?
She considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not
realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally
aware she has not answered and looks at her..

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

          Huh?
She regards him levelly..then makes her decision.

                     FLOR

          No.
He gets out a bottle of vodka.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          I, uh...don't think you should
          either.

                    JOHN

          Then excuse me, because if I had
          the equipment I'd inject the vodka.
He starts to pour.

                    FLOR

          Wait!
              (he stops)
          I think it is so important that we
          are each clear-headed.
He looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor
beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some
time.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          It is very good that you did not
          ask, "why?"

                    JOHN

              (quietly)
          Keep things real, right?

                    FLOR

              (impressed)
          I wouldn't have put it so well.




                                                                111.








168   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - HALF HOUR LATER - NIGHT           168

      They sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the
      greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man.

                          FLOR

                I will remember every
                taste..forever.

                          JOHN

                Tell you the truth..I wanted a shot
                at cooking for you.
                    (shy/his heart)
                I'm very glad you liked it.

                          FLOR

                It's something watching you.
      He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a
      very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man.

                          JOHN

                Well, if it's anything at your end
                imagine over here...scratch
                that..the last thing you want to
                hear is somebody going off on your
                looks.

                          FLOR

                Don't be crazy. Tell me every
                detail.

                          JOHN

                Okay, Flor, yes I will...They
                should name a gender after
                you..Looking at you doesn't do
                it..Staring is the only thing that
                makes sense..and trying not to
                blink so you don't miss anything.
      She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in
      so doing loses his courage..He looks down at his
      hands..shyness again belting him a good one..Still looking
      down.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Look..forgive me..I'm.....It's just
                that you are drop-dead, crazy-
                gorgeous..so much so that I am
                really considering looking at you
                again before we finish up here.

                          FLOR

                Soon, please.
      And now he looks at her.

      CLOSE ON FLOR..





                                                               112.







      Utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before
      being swept away.

                             FLOR (CONT'D)

                   Right now....immediately..we have
                   to dance or kiss.
      He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at
      weighing the two options and then:

      HIS POV..

      Her face..

                             JOHN

                   No contest.
      They kiss.

                             FLOR

                   You sure you're not Mexican.

                             JOHN

                       (smiling/he likes this)
                   What do you mean?

                             FLOR

                   I meant you talk like a Spanish
                   song.

                             JOHN

                   You kiss like a Spanish fly..
                       (on her confusion)
                   Joking around. I don't know what
                   I'm talking about...

                             FLOR

                   Yes you do.
      She breaks and heads for the dining room. John has a moment
      to consider.. He does not have his wits about him..a
      condition every bit as fearsome as liberating.

169   INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM.                             169

      As Flor rummages for another CD, enjoying every minute. She
      places the disk in the player and exits.

170   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN.                                   170

      As she returns...

                             FLOR (CONT'D)

                   This song...You see what a good
                   thing to tell you how you talk like
                   a Mexican song.




                                                          113.







She begins to translate the lyrics.

                     FLOR (CONT'D)

          When I kiss you, entire oceans rush
          through my veins..
              (he is wildly
                uncomfortable)
          Gardens of flowers blossom in my
          body.
He starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
the event..she shakes her head at him..driving the words --
pointing emphatically..she will not have her poetry laughed
at..

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          And you wander along my fertile
          soil, picking its ripe fruit..A
          nightingale undresses on my
          tongue..And under its wings..
He laughs. She stops cold. Looks down..though just seconds
long, this still constitutes the first depression of her
life.

                    JOHN

          I'm sorry. I don't know what I just
          took out of you but tell me how to
          get it back in there..I'm sorry.
          Flor..I'm sorry.

CLOSE ON HER..

The downcast eyes rise to see him..

                    FLOR

          Then respect this.
He looks at her...they kiss..It is a kiss without an author.
God at the controls. They break. There is a beat then..

                    JOHN

          Here's something I never asked
          anyone..Did nightingales undress on
          your tongue?
Flor looks at him with enormous warmth. Her arms looped
around his neck..aware of the music.

                    FLOR

          Did they on yours?

                    JOHN

              (a long beat of
               reflection/then sincere
               and surprised)
          Yeah...




                                                                114.








171   EXT. RESTAURANT - SOME TIME LATER                           171

      Moving camera...the small house turned restaurant..little
      flickers of light...

                          NARRATOR

                My mother never told me the details
                of her visit to the restaurant.
                But she often referred to it as the
                greatest conversation of her life.

172   INT. RESTAURANT - VERY LATE NIGHT...                        172

      They are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa
      just inside the dining room..They are covered by a table
      cloth. They hold hands above the cover...each private but
      still somehow in contact.

                          FLOR

                Oh, Johnny, why is everything so
                damn confusing?

                          JOHN

                Culpa.
      Flor's pleasure zone is rocked. She smiles at his first
      Spanish word. She is wrestling with large feelings of
      pleasure and large ominous thoughts.

                          FLOR

                    (a beat)
                Is your mind racing?

                          JOHN

                I would say my mind has
                evaporated...but that there are
                remnants still standing waiting to
                fall. It feels pretty good.

                          FLOR

                Like happy?

                          JOHN

                Like happy.

                          FLOR

                You think that will last?

                          JOHN

                It's already gone.

                          FLOR

                I understand what you mean.

                          JOHN

                I don't understand what I mean.




                                                       115.








                    FLOR

          That it's getting late. That
          responsibilities have entered your
          brain. Don't hide that from me.
          And really, one large reason we are
          here is because you respect me as a
          mother and I respect you as a
          father..
He is looking at her...she is disconcerted.

                    JOHN

          You're a great and wild mother.

                    FLOR

          You are a beautiful father.
She looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          When Cristina was young, I would
          say I want to take any man who
          wants me to the park and I will
          tell whether I want him from the
          way he is with Cristina. I wish
          you had been in the park then.
              (a beat)
          Any reaction?
John considering and then the answer comes to him.

                       JOHN

          Exactly!..

                    FLOR

          You know, I always think about when
          you...Oh, there's no point. I talk
          too much...
              (a bit of emotion)
          ...because I don't know if we ever
          talk again.

                    JOHN

          Hey, hey..How do you get there?
          Wait.

                    FLOR

          Yes you do. Be honest.

                    JOHN

          I'm being honest.
              (indicates their bodies)
          Look at us - I think I call it
          honesty.




                                                             116.








                          FLOR

                What are we going to do -- go home,
                let our hearts go back in our
                bodies, see each other a few more
                times. Make a tragedy out of us..
      She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a
      small cooing sound.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Ahhhhhhh.
                    (sudden energy)
                There are some mistakes you cannot
                risk when you have kids...Please,
                are you ready to go?

                            JOHN

                     (urgently)
                No. I'm not. No.
                     (then)
                Stay put for a second. Stay here.
                Once our feet touch that floor, I'm
                going to get too many brain cells
                back. So don't be in such a hurry.
                That floor, Flor, is going to eat
                us alive.
                     (she settles back/he is
                      energized)
                So you think it was a mistake up to
                now.
                     (she nods "yes")
                That's rough.
      She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot
      touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him.

                          FLOR

                The mistake....I love it.

173   INT. CLASKY HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT.          173

      Deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of
      her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as
      she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of
      Stone Canyon. In her current shape she would give pause to a
      staff worker at Promises..a shock victim walking through the
      rubble after the bomb has dropped. Deborah's voice is
      scratchy when she speaks.

                          DEBORAH

                Tell me again why I can't call him
                on the cell.

                          EVELYN

                Besides that he turned it off?

                          DEBORAH

                Yes.




                                                       117.








                    EVELYN

          Forty messages start to look needy.

                    DEBORAH

          Mother, you're enjoying this.

                    EVELYN

          No..Definitely not in the way you
          think.

                    DEBORAH

              (staggered)
          You are enjoying it?!?

                    EVELYN

              (rising/honest)
          I am enjoying actually being of use
          to my daughter. I am enjoying the
          fact that I really know how to
          advise you and the miracle that you
          are so deeply disoriented that you
          are gobbling up everything I say.
Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a
somewhat new way..as if Evelyn were an actual person instead
of an upsetting extension of herself.

                    DEBORAH

              (vulnerable)
          There's one thing I'd like to say
          to you about you and me.

                    EVELYN

          You don't have to.

                       DEBORAH

          I want to.

                       EVELYN

          Okay.

                    DEBORAH

              (quite vulnerable and
               appealing)
          You were an alcoholic and wildly
          promiscuous woman during my
          formative years so that I am in
          this fix because of you. It is your
          fault. I just needed..
              (gestures heart to heart)
          ..that moment for us.

                    EVELYN

          You have a solid point, dear. But
          right now the lessons of my life
          are coming in handy for you.




                                                        118.








                    DEBORAH

          There's a car coming....
Evelyn moves to her.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          It's him...he's got to tell me
          everything..
Evelyn shakes her head "no."

                       DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                 (wild-eyed)
          Yes!

                    EVELYN

          Do you know that right now you are
          your own worst enemy..that you
          can't trust one thought in your
          brain?

                       DEBORAH

          Duh.

                    EVELYN

          Then trust me and only allow
          yourself to say one thing to
          him..One thing..."I'm so glad
          you're back."

                       DEBORAH

          Huh?

                       EVELYN

          Yes.

                    DEBORAH

              (babbling)
          But I've got to know whether he
          touched her - where he touched her -
          how he touched her - if they broke
          a sweat --- what they said - who
          made the first move - how they left
          it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
          an intention of making contact in
          the future - what she wore - how he
          felt afterwards - whether anyone
          mentioned me..
              (a wail)
          ..whether they held hands when they
          left..
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs.




                                                             119.








                          EVELYN

                Just those words I said. If you
                want a prayer of coming out of
                this.

                          DEBORAH

                I know you're right..But..

                            EVELYN

                But what?

                          DEBORAH

                    (a small voice)
                I forgot the sentence you said I
                should say.

                          EVELYN

                "I'm so glad you're back."

                          DEBORAH

                Okay..do I have to wait here?

                          EVELYN

                No..he may not come up here..go to
                him.

                          DEBORAH

                Why wouldn't he come up here?

                            EVELYN

                Just go.

                          DEBORAH

                Do I need a little makeup?

                          EVELYN

                You need a hose but you don't have
                the time. It's fine that you look
                like that. It's genuine..You can
                use genuine.

                          DEBORAH

                Thank you, mom.
      She takes a breath exits...

174   INT. STAIRWELL                                           174

      She pauses at the top of the stairs..a breath..then unable to
      help herself runs down them at breakneck speed.

175   INT. DOWNSTAIRS..                                        175

      John turning a light on when Deborah bursts into the room.




                                                               120.








                          DEBORAH

                I'm so glad to see you
                    (correcting self)
                ..that you're back.
      John looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is
      thrown. His demeanor has changed...deeper..serious..

                          JOHN

                It's late, Deborah.
      The wrong words start to form..she stops herself..

                          DEBORAH

                Well, I just wanted to say.. what I
                said..
      She is on the stairway..he turns to go in the opposite
      direction.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                    (way too loud)
                Uhhhh..
      He turns back to her...she stops herself from straying into
      untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to
      bed.

                          JOHN

                    (a beat then)
                I can't sleep upstairs with you..
                Just can't for now.
      This rocks her..panicked she grabs at her life preserver.

                          DEBORAH

                I'm just so glad you're back.
      Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest
      of footings for them...He looks at her directly for the first
      time since she told him.

                          JOHN

                Yeah..okay.
      She nods..then goes back up the stairs..

176   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 176

      Evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands
      clear to let her enter. As Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable
      - her breath racing.

                          DEBORAH

                I am literally choking on unsaid
                words..seriously. If this were a
                restaurant ten people would have
                their knuckles in my sternum.




                                                             121.








                          EVELYN

                The fact that you didn't just make
                things worse should fill you with
                hope..
      In her current state, she has to process that one..and does.
      Her breath slows.

177   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              177

      The first time we've seen this room since Flor was working
      the sewing machine...John enters. He is down, longing and
      finality make for a brutal cocktail..He rubs his head and
      sits near the sewing machine..He glances over and sees Flor's
      Spanish/English dictionary..There is a knock on the door.

                          JOHN

                Deb, I'm done tonight. I don't
                think we can jam anything else in.

                          BERNICE'S VOICE

                It's me, Dad.
      He springs from the bed and opens the door.

                          JOHN

                What's up, honey?

                          BERNICE

                Just thought I'd check that you
                were back and okay and all.

                          JOHN

                    (feigning innocence)
                Because?

                          BERNICE

                Mom was crying for six hours
                straight and Grandma was in with
                her all that time mostly saying,
                "he'll be back..he'll be back."
                I've got to get back to Georgie.

                          JOHN

                I just hate that you had that kind
                of a night.

                          BERNICE

                It's good for me to worry about
                something that really matters
                instead of the stupid stuff that's
                usually on my mind...

                          JOHN

                Like?




                                                               122.








                              BERNICE

                       (a big grin)
                   Surviving.

                             JOHN

                   You're fantastic, Bernie...I love
                   you.

                             BERNICE

                   It's a slant...
                       (pause then)
                   Hey..I know there's a lot you went
                   through but I knew all along that
                   Grandma was right about you coming
                   back..I mean totally knew it so I
                   wasn't that worried. But still I...
                       (some emotion out of
                        hiding)
                   I really appreciate it, Dad.
                   Thanks....Stop staring at me..what?
                   You don't know what to say?

                             JOHN

                   Right. I don't know what to say.

                             BERNICE

                   Just what you taught me..You're
                   welcome.

                             JOHN

                   You're welcome.
      They kiss.

178   EXT. STONE CANYON -     MORNING.                           178

      Flor purposefully walking up the hill..

179   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                   179

      As Flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once
      in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming
      in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on
      interview day.

180   EXT. CLASKY POOL - DAY.                                    180

      Evelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool..Cristina,
      wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...

                             CRISTINA

                   Hey, mom...Is it okay if we don't
                   leave right away?
      The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the
      situation and gets out of the pool..Flor is awkward..no idea
      how to handle this...so she goes direct.




                                                       123.








                     FLOR

          No...
              (as Cristina begins to
                protest)
          No..and we must say "goodbye." I
          don't work here anymore.
She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to
embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go
nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but
it is said with total calm.

                    GEORGIE

          Do I have to get out?

                    FLOR

          No, Georgie..Stay. I think you are
          a wonderful boy..be good..like you
          are. There are no monsters.

                    GEORGIE

          Thanks..thanks. Okay.
Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted
Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three
word proddings in Spanish.

                    BERNICE

              (severely to Georgie)
          I can't believe you didn't get out.

                       GEORGIE

          Flor said.

                    BERNICE

              (to Flor)
          I don't want to get you wet.

                    FLOR

          Get me wet.

                    BERNICE

              (rushing to hug her)
          Thanks.
Bernice hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina..

                    EVELYN

          You...are...a...trip.

                    FLOR

              (to Bernice)
          You're a beauty. Amazing girl.




                                                                124.







      Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over
      the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal
      human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be
      recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom
      window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as
      Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina.

                          BERNICE

                My last chance to have some of you
                rub off on me..
                    (Cristina doesn't
                     understand)
                I'm sorry you're so sad but this
                could have been so much worse.

                             CRISTINA

                       (from her depths)
                How?
      And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but
      Flor manages..

                          EVELYN

                    (to Cristina)
                Why don't you run upstairs and say
                goodbye to Deborah?
      Flor flashes a look of thanks.

                          FLOR

                I'll be in front.
      Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks
      toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom..

                          DEBORAH

                Please come see me.
      And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances
      up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
      hears the beginning of their exchange

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                It's okay, honey..we'll see each
                other at school..I'm going to keep
                an eye on you..I will.
      Flor enters the house...

181   INT. KITCHEN - DAY.                                         181

      She stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head
      to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as
      she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper
      landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her
      things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off
      to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot.




                                                             125.








                          DEBORAH

                Please stick your head in here for
                a minute.
      Flor nods and starts up the stairs...

182   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                                   182

      Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside..then
      closes it.

                          DEBORAH

                What's with avoiding me, am I this
                horrible person?
      As Flor just looks at her.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                I know. It's a ridiculous question
                but sometimes I'm ridi...

                          FLOR

                No. It's a good question. A fine
                question. Complicated.
                    (beat then)
                I was just thinking to answer.

                           DEBORAH

                Oh stop.   Come on. Weren't we
                close?

                            FLOR

                      (like a shot)
                No.

                          DEBORAH

                    (truly hurt)
                Well, I'm very, very disappointed
                to hear that. It makes me feel like
                a fool.

                          FLOR

                    (compassion forces a
                     crumb)
                We weren't close..but we were
                connected...in a bad way.

                          DEBORAH

                    (strangely soothed)
                You know something, I think we're
                saying the same thing...Look as
                long as we're doing closure..What
                did you and my husband, John, do
                last night?
      Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.

                          FLOR

                I can only tell you what I did.




                                                               126.








                          DEBORAH

                That will be sufficient.

                          FLOR

                    (these are tender
                     feelings)
                I became sure of what an incredibly
                lucky woman you are and I must make
                myself not envy you which is hard.
                No, it's not hard. It's impossible.
                Now please..I am exhausted.

                          DEBORAH

                Same here - believe me.
      Deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture
      because Flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to
      hurry as she goes.

                          FLOR

                Cristina, apúrate.

183   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                    183

      As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she
      punches in the exit code...

      ANGLE ON GATE

      As it swings open to reveal John...

184   EXT. STREET - DAY.                                         184

      As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.

                          JOHN

                I was hanging out here waiting.
                Can't give you guys a lift?
      Flor shakes her head "no." She looks away for a beat so the
      next thing she does is a considered action. She leans forward
      and kisses him on the lips. John looks at her.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                This is killer.
                    (on her confusion)
                Incredibly hard.

                          FLOR

                Yes, Cari..
      The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful
      of loot.

                          JOHN

                    (reading Flor)
                Let her have it..party favors.




                                                              127.







      She nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.

                             FLOR

                Cristina..

                          CRISTINA

                Goodbye, Mr. Clasky..I am very
                sorry we will not see each other as
                frequently.
      She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on
      the back.

                             FLOR

                Yes.
      They turn and begin walking down the street.

      SHOT - STONE CANYON

      The women walking toward camera, John briefly in the
      background...As they begin their walk Flor begins talking in
      Spanish.

                          NARRATOR

                The first minute we were alone, my
                mother told me that I would no
                longer go to the private school.

                          CRISTINA

                No. No..You can't. I won't be able
                to forgive you..It will be the end.
                I won't let you.
      And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
      walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
      with enormous dedication. CAMERA BEGINS A PULL BACK.
      Cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left
      by the wayside..People noticing..Cristina's conduct violating
      tacit zoning laws.

      CLOSER SHOT..

      So we can see their faces in the struggle.

185   EXT. BUS STOP..                                            185

      As they wait...Flor talks sharply to Cristina to control
      herself.

                          NARRATOR

                My mother changed our lives once
                more. This time because she saw in
                me, to her great alarm, a character
                flaw of some size. She has taught
                me to be a watch dog of my
                character, to control my ambition.
                I am not quite there.




                                                              128.







      One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives.

186   INT. BUS - DAY.                                           186

      Almost empty - it's Saturday. Mother and daughter sit
      together by the giant window in the center of the bus.
      Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
      with stoic dignity. The girl is becoming less inconsolable
      and more in need of mothering.

                           NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                For that reason should you choose
                to grant me your scholarship my
                mother, at my request, will be
                relocating to the New York
                Metropolitan Area so that she can
                stay close during my time at
                Princeton.
      Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and
      wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.

                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                I hope my essay has done her
                justice. I love her with all my
                heart.

                                                        FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WOODED HILLSIDE. DAY.

We see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks with
her as she runs through the thick woods. She is exerting
herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looks
behind her quickly, and continues.

ANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running through
the woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's,
and show several days growth of beard. The leader stops for
a moment, and looks around. The two men separate.

ANGLE, the  young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over
a ravine.  She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to
catch her  breath. She looks around, and looks back, her back
to a steep  wall, a steep drop before her.

ANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spot
vacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague.
He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in
the ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up.

ANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep
rockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up.
Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge.

Standing here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat older
than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy
BDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which he
closes. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young
woman, seen disappearing over a ridge.

                       SCOTT
                  (quietly)
             ...you better catch her...

The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface
behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots
of trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries to
work himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks to
Scott for help.

                       SCOTT
             ...your Dad's napping on the
             sofa, your Mom's watching Let's
             Make A Deal, and God is Dead.
             What do you expect me to do...?

                       YOUNG MAN
                  (very weakly)
             ...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's
             no way...

                                                              2.


                      SCOTT
            There's always a way...Don't You
            tell me there's no way...

A pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scott
looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives
her a "hold" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods,
as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs.
The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.

                      SCOTT
            How 'bout that? That's called
            'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted
            In.

He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not
heavily, but convincingly, several times.

                      SCOTT
            This is where you get in. The
            mugger don't care. The shooter
            don't care...get up...Or I will
            beat you to death on this fucken
            hill...Now: you better Catch her...

He motions with his head. In the BG we see the young woman
nod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment,
breast a hill, and disappear again...

ANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now,
of self-pity, as if he just realized something.

                      SCOTT
                 (responding to his look.
                 As if to say "That's right.")
            There's nothing but the mission...

The young man begins to climb the rockface.

HOLD on Scott for a moment.

INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.

A large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of
the rough building. It reads:

                    These are the precincts of pain.
                    A goddess lives here.
                    Her name is Victory.

In front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier.
She is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck.
Camera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee,
and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier.

                                                             3.


She stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.

                         SCOTT
            Well done.

                      YOUNG WOMAN (JACKIE BLACK)
            A signal honor to work with you,
            sir.

                      SCOTT
            Thank you, Sergeant.

He starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly,
to indicate she has something more to say. He turns back to her.

                      JACKIE BLACK
            Sir: Day or Night. Black or White.
            You reach out for me. "Black,
            Jaqueline A. US 24191489."

                      SCOTT
            I'll remember, Sergeant.

She nods, and walks off. Scott walks toward a mess tent. He
is joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure of
an older man. He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched
jacket and trousers, without insignia. Scott is greeted by
him, as they walk toward the mess tent. Scott shows the
notebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook to
what we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess
tent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. Blane takes
the notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent.

ANGLE HIS POV, Scott enters the tent. Several of the young
men react to him. He nods to them. Among them, we see the
young man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes
over to Scott.

ANGLE, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a
tinfoil tray with some food on it. Scott takes out a
stiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade
emerges. He begins to use it to cut up his meat. The young
man from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, till
Scott turns, acknowledging him.

Anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit
card, old, creased cardboard: It reads, "Rogers Rangers,
Rules for Engagement. 1782". There is a line drawing of a
man with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it,
boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. Written on the
card, in old faded ink, "SGT. Anton, M. US. 3149584, United
States Special Forces." The young man (Anton) shows the card
to Scott.

                                                           4.


                      SCOTT
                 (of the card)
            What's this then?

                      ANTON
            It was my father's, sir.

                      SCOTT
            He carry it Over There?

As they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules -
"Dated 1759". "Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see and
what you do - there is an army depending on us for correct
information. You can lie all you please when you tell other
folks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger or
an Officer".

                        ANTON
            Yes, sir.

                      SCOTT
            He come back?

                      ANTON
            Yes, sir. He did.

                      SCOTT
                 (nods. Pause)
            Well, so.

Scott pauses again. As he looks at the young man, who is
obviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of
occasion.

                      SCOTT
            You carry that card, son. It
            might save your life.
                 (Anton nods)
            ...You could use it to light a
            fire, or something...

Blane's Aide calls the men to order.

                      BLANE'S AIDE
            The Candidate Cadre will fall in
            on the White Line...

The men start to come to their feet, and leave the mess tent.

                      ANTON
            I just wanted to say, sir...That,
            to meet you...

                                                              5.


                      SCOTT
                 (rising, as he gives
                 the Ranger card back
                 to Anton)
            You never met me. You've been up
            for a week. You're seeing Snakes...

The exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. They
are happy, and joking with one another. In the BG we see
those who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus
which has just pulled up.

ANGLE on a young man, who looks out of the window.

ANGLE HIS POV. Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with
dufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus.

ANGLE, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, who
stands next to Scott, outside the tent. Scott stands next to
an old, but pristine Mustang Cobra. He withdraws a small
dufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Anton
standing next to him.

                       ANTON
                 (looking after the
                 departing, failed men)
            ...I can't imagine how they live
            with it...

ANGLE on Scott. As he thinks a very brief moment, as if
reluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton.

                      SCOTT
            Make sure you can't imagine it,
            cause, if you can, it's just one
            step to doing it.

Anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed
men.

                      SCOTT
                 (pause)
            ...they'll be back where they
            came from by Morning, and all
            this is just a Bad Dream.

                      ANTON
            My name is...

                                                             6.


                      SCOTT
            Do I need to know?
                 (pause)
            If I want Camaraderie, I'll join
            the Masons.
                 (pause. Then, summing
                 it all up:)
            There's just the mission.

Beat. Anton steps away.

                      BLANE'S AIDE
                 (as he glances down at
                 his clipboard)
            Congratulations on completion of
            this evolution. I know you would
            probably like some sleep, but I
            do not think you'd mind sparing
            ten minutes for Induction.

The camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very
proud young men.

ANGLE on Blane and Scott, off to the side.

Beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates,
filling up.

                      BLANE
            Thank you, Bobby.

                      SCOTT
            Not at all, Sir...

                      BLANE
            ...You going home?

                      SCOTT
            ...weather permitting, Sir...

                      BLANE'S AIDE
                 (in the distance. As
                 camera tracks with
                 Blane and Scott)
            ...as I call your names:
                 (he consults his clipboard)
            Grossler, Anton...

These two men steps forward.

ANGLE, on Anton, nodding to himself at the proudest moment
of his life.

ANGLE, CU Scott, looking at him.

                                                                7.


Camera takes Blane and Scott into a cinderblock building
which houses a shooting range. We see various housefronts,
and storefronts, and targets. A long table along one wall
holds a coffee urn. Blane draws two cups of coffee.

Through the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling,
entering the building. Anton comes into the room, and smiles
at Scott.

We see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane,
drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blane
gestures to Scott, meaning, "Shall we begin?" Scott
hesitates for a moment, and then nods.

FOCUS.

ANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward to
address the two candidates.

                        BLANE
                  (over his shoulder, to
                  an Aide)
             ...would you bolt the door,
             please...?

Scott gestures to the Aide, "One Moment".

                        BLANE
                  (to the candidates)
             ...are you tired, Gentlemen?
                  (the two young men smile)
             This is the completion of the
             evolution:
                  (beat)
             Only one of you may join the
             unit. The first man through that
             door will be inducted.

He gestures at a far door in the room.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get
the picture.

Beat.

                       SCOTT
                  (to himself, quietly)
             ...yeah...you wanted to know the
             'secret knowledge'...

CU Scott  as he looks, interrogating the   two men, weighing
them, as  they look at each other. Beat.   Grossler starts to
advance  on Anton, in a fighting crouch.   Scott gestures to
the Aide  that that was what he wanted to   see.

                                                              8.


The Aide lets Scott out of the back door.

EXT. CINDERBLOCK BUILDING. DAY.

Scott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and
jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow
duffle-bag. He opens the trunk.

He takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we
now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes
and saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from
the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with
a colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts
to get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching
past. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the
direction of Scott.

                      DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                 (to that man)
            What the hell are you looking at?
            There ain't nobody there...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. DUSK.

A young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which
we find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high
chainlink fence topped with barbed wire.

ANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in
his direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the
lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open.

We see a sign "McGarrity Construction Company" on the gate.

The young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We
see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered
desk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and
opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles,
and grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is
found in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone
quickly.

                      YOUNG WORKER
                 (into phone)
            ...Frontgate...

We see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad.

INT. MUSTANG. DAY.

Scott, driving, comes around a bend.

                                                              9.


ANGLE HIS POV. The construction trailer up ahead. We see the
young worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road
giving a "Stop" signal to the car.

ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop,
and get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young
worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott
takes the paper and begins to read.

He looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see
the worker begin to respond, his body language saying
"That's all I know." As he starts to speak his words are
drowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up.

ANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low.

ANGLE INT. THE HELICOPTER. A man in civilian clothes points
out Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot. Through the canopy
we see Scott and the construction canopy down below. The
helicopter goes into a tight turn.

ANGLE Scott. Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn,
and begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away.

ANGLE, the sheet of paper Scott holds. Is reads: "All hands."
Over the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving
directions about the car, to the young worker. Camera takes
Scott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he
retrieves his gym bag. He hands the keys to the young worker,
and takes off, running, to the helicopter.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the
helicopter takes off.

ANGLE, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear.

INT. HELICOPTER. NIGHT.

Scott, asleep. As the helicopter banks low over the Charles
River and Harvard College. A Crewman shakes him awake.

ANGLE, EXT: the helicopter descends into the field of a
football stadium. A black suburban is waiting.

EXT. BOATHOUSE. CHARLES RIVER. NIGHT.

Seen through the windshield of a car.

ANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the
boathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main
entrance.

                                                            10.


Scott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban,
and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large,
paint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads
"Temporarily Closed For Repairs".

ANGLE, INT. THE BOATHOUSE. The group pushes through the
drape, beyond which we see several men in suits, holding
assault rifles.

An older government type, MILLER, followed by an AIDE, walks
up to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards
that Scott is to be admitted, that he is "okay". Miller
gestures to Scott that it will just be a moment. The Aide
hands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the
boathouse. We see the long skiffs up on their rests, the
Charles River beyond.

ANGLE on Scott. As Scott looks through the papers. Around
him we see communications equipment being hurriedly assembled.

ANGLE INSERT. The top sheet shows a color photo of a
phenomenally lovely redheaded girl in her teens. As Scott
talks, he leafs through the sheets to reveal several photos
of her and a man, obviously her father, holding her hand.
One is a print of a glossy magazine article.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the photo, nodding
                 to himself, as he reads)
            "...Betty Coed, has hair of red
            for Harvard..."

                      AIDE
                 (of the top photo)
            It's not current.

                      SCOTT
            Why not...?

ANGLE on them as they arrive at a small equipment room.
Through the door we see a young government type, Gaines, his
suitcoat off, his shoulder holster empty, being interrogated
by several colleagues.

                      AIDE
            It seems she got a makeover today.
            We're working on it.

He hands a small log book to Scott, and points to an entry.
Scott looks down the entries, and glances up, now and then,
at the man being interrogated.

                                                          11.


                      SCOTT
                 (reads)
            4PM. Cut n'Curl...

                      AIDE
            Gave her a crewcut, dyed it
            platinum blonde...

                      SCOTT
                 (glancing up at the
                 man in the chair)
            Met with her boyfriend at ten.
            Then...?

The Aide shrugs, meaning, "That's it..."

                      SCOTT
            ...he's on Post until he turned
            her over to the Nightwatch...?

                      AIDE
            He says he was...

                      SCOTT
            Who else you got...?

Miller gestures to an associate, who comes forward, passing
photos to Scott, as Miller goes to look through the glass at
the young man being interrogated.

                      AIDE
            ...we got the boyfriend, Michael
            Blake.

                      SCOTT
            ...where is he...?

We are shown a photo of an Ivy League preppy chap around 18.
He is on a sailboat.

                      AIDE
            Was not in his dorm last night,
            we're shaking the trees...And...
                 (Scott is passed
                 another photo)
            Professor Gerald Sloane, notably
            chummy with his female students,
            of which she was one. Weekend
            home, Martha's Vineyard...

                      SCOTT
            ...for sure...?

                                                             12.


                      AIDE
            Been there since Friday.

We see a photo, obviously from a school catalogue, of a
youngish bearded man, in front of a blackboard. We see
Miller in the BG finish his meeting and turn to the group.

                      MILLER
            I'm light. I'm light, people...I
            need another team on the
            Professor, I need an overwatch
            on the boyfriend...

The Aide hands him a sheet of paper, obviously a roster.

Scott, looking at the board. He puts down his head for a
moment, and blinks his eyes, trying to clear his head.

                      MILLER
            You just come from the Cadre.

                       SCOTT
            Yes sir.

                      MILLER
            How long since you've slept?

                      SCOTT
            Not significant.

                      MILLER
            You take a team, and Bulldog.
            Are you up for it?

                      SCOTT
                 (absently, as he looks
                 over the materials he
                 has been given)
            Sir, "this Marine pisses av gas
            and farts blackpowder, Sir."

                      MILLER
            Thank you for coming, Bobby.

                      SCOTT
            Are you kidding, sir...?

An Associate comes over and hands him a piece of paper.
Miller shakes his head.

                      MILLER
            I don't have the bodies. Call em
            in...call em in...

                                                             13.


ANGLE on Scott. CU. As he watches the interrogation of
Gaines in the next room. The young man begins to pick up his
coffee cup, and we see that it shakes.

ANGLE on Scott, as he gestures to Miller to look through the
glass, at the young man being interrogated, who is now seen
to be wiping his brow, and shaking his head. The young man
tries to take a sip of coffee, and spills it, inadvertently,
down his shirtfront. Scott exchanges a glance with Miller,
and walks into the equipment room, to the interrogation.

The man being interrogated, the government type, Gaines, is
in his early thirties. He is sweating and obviously
frightened. An Aide comes and stands by Scott.

                      AIDE
                 (whispering)
            His post was Harvard Yard.
            Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner,
            Lowell House, across from her
            dorm. Nightwatch relieved him
            there, Midnight...

ANGLE, on Miller in the interrogation room. Miller nods to
Scott, meaning "You know what to do."

ANGLE on Gaines, as Scott enters, the interrogators step
back for Miller, who is obviously their superior. He motions
them to continue.

Camera holds Scott throughout the following interchange,
with the suspect and questioners seen reflected in the glass
of the door.

                         INTERROGATOR
            Once more:

                      GAINES
            She, uh. She had lunch with her
            father.

                      INTERROGATOR
            Lunch with her father - you
            seconded to that detail?

                      GAINES
            No, sir. I just had her.

                      INTERROGATOR
            "...you just had her..."

                      GAINES
            I. Uh...uh. I had her all day.
            Tucked her in. At Ten. And she...

                                                      14.


                      INTERROGATOR
            ...yeah, "she had a tiff with
            her boyfriend..."

                        GAINES
            Yes. I...

                      INTERROGATOR
            Michael Blake -
                 (he holds up a photo
                 of a preppy fellow)


                      MILLER
            What was it about?

                      GAINES
            I think it was about her...her...
                 (he makes gestures of haircutting)


                      MILLER
            Her haircut...
                 (Gaines nods)
            So it wasn't a serious...?

                      GAINES
            No, no.
                 (pause)
            No.
                 (pause)
            And then I,
                 (he covers his mouth
                 as he speaks)
            I held the post until relieved...
                 (he gestures at his
                 notebook, as if to
                 support him)


Miller motions at Scott.

                      MILLER
            Well, then, we've got a little
            problem.

                      GAINES
                 (shaking his head in denial)
            I was there.

                                                            15.


                      MILLER
                 (reading)
            23.12 Hours, 19 May. Harvard
            Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell
            House, reveals no Secret Service
            Presence, neither this post nor
            adjacent...
                 (he looks through his notes)
            ...a second tour, 23.30, reveals,
            similarly...

                      GAINES
            I was there, Sir.

                      MILLER
                 (to Gaines)
            Who's lying?
                 (pause)
            You or him?
                 (pause. Gaines slightly
                 averts his head.)


ANGLE on Miller, who gives an infinitesimal sign to Scott
who steps forward and slaps Gaines across the face.

                      SCOTT
            You son of a bitch, I've got
            fifteen years in, and three kids,
            and you're gonna sit there, and
            lie away my Pension...

He makes a move toward Gaines.

                      GAINES
            I...

                      SCOTT
            ...don't you tell me you were
            there...

                      GAINES
            I was On Post...

                      SCOTT
                 (as he moves towards
                 Gaines seriously)
            ...you lying swine...Don't you
            tell me you were On Post!

Miller gestures to a couple of the types who take Scott out
of the room and sit him forcefully, in a chair...cautioning
him to stay still.

                                                           16.


Miller now stands by him.

HOLD on Scott who uses the pause to review the documents he
holds, the photos of the girl, of the Boyfriend, of the
Professor. He picks up another glossy magazine showing the
redheaded girl - the caption reads "America is Seeing Red".

                      INTERROGATOR
            Shall I tell you what's gonna
            happen to you, when we find you out?

                      GAINES
            ...I...
                 (he gets up and walks,
                 wearily, toward the
                 windows, and turns)
            I...Uh...

                      INTERROGATOR
            Were you fucking her...?
                 (pause)
            We're gonna find out...

                      GAINES
            No, I...um...

                      INTERROGATOR
            ...Where Is She?

Scott turns, to Miller, who is seen, beyond the door, in
conference with several government types.

Scott leaves the room, and is seen, on the outskirts of the
conference.

                      MILLER
            We've got until her Monday
            Morning Class, and then it's
            Meet the Press; and "Where is
            she...?"
                 (he shakes his head)
            Who's got the Professor...? Where
            is he...?

                      AN AGENT
            Martha's Vineyard.

                      MILLER
            Who's got him?

                      AN AGENT
            Jones and Shannon.

                                                            17.


Throughout this section camera holds Scott. As he looks
through the file, the various photos, and notations, and
takes notes in as small pocket notebook, in which we also
see the small cardboard card of "Rogers Rangers Rules of
Engagement".

                      MILLER
                 (to the group)
            Wake him up, shake him up. He
            don't want to talk...
                 (he holds out his hand,
                 and an Aide puts some
                 papers into it)
            Here's what we have him doing
            with his Female Students, show
            'em to his wife...The Photo...?
                 (one of the agents
                 brings in two photographs)
            Here is the last known photo...of
            the girl.

HOLD on Scott, at the back of the group, taking notes. We
see him holding several newsclippings. One of them shows the
girl, and the headline reads "America is Seeing Red."

We see the photo blown up, of the ravishingly beautiful
young girl with long red hair. It features a small, red
enamel crescent earring. The second photo shows the same
girl, in the same pose, but now her hair is short and
platinum blonde and spiky. The agent opens two boxes and
begins distributing the photos to the group.

                      MILLER
            The lab ran it up, based on the
            testimony of the beauty shop. We
            have not told Boston or Cambridge
            PD, nor have we...

An agent comes up and hands him a sheet of paper.

                      AN AGENT
            The Professor...

                      MILLER
                 (to the associate)
            You had him in his home...

                      AN AGENT
            Sir, we were in Error, we...

                      MILLER
            Where is he...?

                                                             18.


                      AN AGENT
            Best guess puts him on his boat.
            Last seen out of West Tisbury,
            Martha's Vine...

                      MILLER
            Find him. Put the guard on him.
            Get me an overflight.
                 (generally)
            I'm light, I'm light, people.
                 (he points to an associate)
            Shake the Trees. I'm light,
            here...I'm 25 men light. Get 'em
            in. Who's got the
            Coastguard...What's the name of
            his boat? Professor Gerald Sloane...

An Aide comes in, hurriedly.

                      AIDE
            It's the boyfriend. He's moving...

Miller points at Scott, who rises.

                      SCOTT
            I've got him...

                      MILLER
                 (coming over to Scott)
            ...I've got two days to run in.
            Before the Press wakes up.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he responds to the
                 inherent request in
                 Miller's voice)
            Whatever it takes, sir...

Miller nods his appreciation.

Scott exits, and we HOLD on Miller giving orders to his group.

EXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT.

Two students, walking through the yard. They acknowledge a
uniformed security guard, who walks, with his back to us.

A slight, Asian young woman, her arms full of books, walks
toward the camera, hurrying. She indicates something, back
over her shoulder, and the guard, who is in front of the
camera, walking away, veers off in that direction.

                                                             19.


EXT. VESTIBULE, HARVARD DORM. NIGHT.

A young man (MICHAEL BLAKE) is, furtively, working on
jimmying open one of a set of mailboxes. He senses something,
and turns.

ANGLE HIS POV. The Security Guard (Scott) standing just
beyond a glass door, looking in at him. Scott enters, coming
to camera.

                      SCOTT
            Could I see your hands, son...?

The Boy, Blake, moves his hands away from his body, to show
a screwdriver. Scott motions him away from the mailbox,
which we see is in the process of being demolished. Scott
reads the name on the mailbox.

                       SCOTT
            L. Newton.
                 (pause)
            You lose your mailbox key, Mr.
            Newton...?
                 (pause)


                      BLAKE
            Um.

                      SCOTT
            You a student here?

                      BLAKE
            Yes.

                      SCOTT
            Could I see some identification,
            please...? Mr. Newton?
                 (Scott takes out a
                 walkie and begins to
                 talk into it)
            Ten-Twelve patrol, requesting...

                      BLAKE
            No, please...please...
                 (pause)
            Please, Oh, God.

He starts to advance on Scott, who draws a nightstick, and
keeps him at bay.

                      SCOTT
            Calm down, Son. It's gonna be
            what it's gonna be...

                                                          20.


                      BLAKE
            One minute, could I please talk
            to you for one minute...Look
            look look: I broke up with My
            Girlfriend...

ANGLE EXT. THE VESTIBULE. The young Asian girl, now walking
with a male friend, pass in front of the vestibule. Beyond
them we see Blake and Scott, as Blake motions to the mailbox,
and moves to the mailbox and takes out a letter.

ANGLE INT. THE VESTIBULE. On Scott, as he watches Blake take
a letter out of the jimmied mailbox.

                       SCOTT
                 (of the letter)
            Laura.
                 (he rereads the
                 nameplate on the mailbox)
            Laura Newton?
                 (pause)
            Laura Newton? Is that 'the' Laura
            Newton...?

                      BLAKE
            We broke up. Alright? Laura
            Newton. They know who I am.

                      SCOTT
            Who?

                      BLAKE
            The Secret Service.

                      SCOTT
            The Secret Service?

                      BLAKE
            That's right, that's right. They
            know who I am. You...They've
            "cleared" me.

                      SCOTT
                 (gesturing to the
                 jimmied mailbox)
            They didn't clear you for this.

                      BLAKE
            You, you hear me out, and, if
            you want to, Then...
                 (pause)
            Okay? Okay???
                 (pause)

                                                             21.


                        SCOTT
              I have to call it in.

                        BLAKE
              Please...please. Five
              minutes...That's all I want.
              Please. Please...She
              would...she...
                   (his face brightens at
                   the new idea)
              Maybe she's in her room!

                        SCOTT
              You tried the bell, you called
              her...

                        BLAKE
                   (as it dawns on him)
              Maybe she's ill...

INT. CORRIDOR, HARVARD DORM. NIGHT.

Blake and Scott, as they walk up to a door. Scott knocks on
the door.

                        SCOTT
              ...Mzz Newton...?
                   (pause)
              Mz Newton...this is Campus
              Security...

He begins to fumble with keys at his belt.

ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Several agents, obviously involved in
investigating the room, wearing plastic gloves, stop. One,
silently, unlocks the door.

We   see Scott enter the room, "miming" using a key, and turn
on   the light and look inside. We take him to her desk, where
he   finds several photos of her and her father - and a note
on   he desk, reading "Dear Dad-Thanks for coming-signed %-)".

We see the boy, Blake, out in the corridor, unable to see
into the room.

                        SCOTT
              Mz Newton...?
                   (pause)


ANGLE, in the hall, as Scott and Blake stand there, a young
girl comes down the hall and stops, opposite her room.

                                                             22.


                      YOUNG GIRL
            Hey, Mike. Sprised to see you
            there.
                 (smiles)
            That was some Vicious Performance...

She smiles brightly and goes into her room. Scott looks at
Blake.

EXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT.

Blake and Scott sitting on a bench in the deserted yard.
Scott holds the envelope and the letter, on which we see
this symbol %-) and begin to read: "This is a sham. Your
view of the world is not cockeyed, but corrupt. You cunt.
And you deserve everything that is going to happen to you..."

                      BLAKE
            ...I was just...trying to
            retrieve the letter.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the letter.

                      SCOTT
            ...this is not very nice language.
                 (pause, Blake looks away)
            How old is this girl?

                       BLAKE
            She's...just turned 18.
                 (Scott shakes his head,
                 sadly. pause)
            I was mad.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the letter:)
            ..."everything that's going to
            happen to her"...What was going
            to happen to her?
                 (pause)
            You hurt her...?
                 (pause)
            Did y'hit her, son...?

                      BLAKE
            Hit her? No. I...
                 (he gestures to the note)
            I called her...I called her a
            whore...I...

                      SCOTT
            Why...?

                                                          23.


The boy bangs his head. Scott, as he rises, brings Blake to
his feet.

                      SCOTT
                 (as if realizing "This
                 is the question")
            Where is she?

                      BLAKE
                 (as if the question
                 had not occurred to
                 him previously)
            She must...she must...she must
            have gone home...

                      SCOTT
            Why...?

                      BLAKE
                 (gesturing around, quietly)
            Because the Secret Service, isn't...

As they walk by a parked van, we cut inside the van. Where
we see a Secret Service type. Through the windshield we see
Scott gesture "Do Not Intervene."

ANGLE, on Scott and Blake, as they walk down the near-
deserted Mass Ave.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the sign on the
                 letter,the "Picasso"
                 sign, that is %-}. He
                 turns the sign
                 rightside up to show
                 it is a 'cockeyed smile')
            What is this sign?

                      BLAKE
            It's how she signs her letters.
                 (smiles)
            Cause she looks at everything
            cockeyed...Like Picasso - she
            said they called her "Picasso".
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Who called her that...?

                                                             24.


                      BLAKE
            You know, her, her...
                 (remembering)
            He saw her yesterday! Maybe
            she's...maybe she's with him!

                      SCOTT
            Why'd you fight with her, Son...?

                      BLAKE
                 (pause)
            She, uh, she got her hair
            done...She cut it off. She dyed
            it blonde. I said she looked
            like a slut...and...
                 (pause)


                       SCOTT
            Beautiful young girl like that.
            We've all seen her pictures.
            What'd you care how she dyed her
            hair?
                  (pause)
            What'd you care...? Why's that
            make her a slut...?
                  (pause)


                       BLAKE
            She...
                  (pause)
            Uh...

                      SCOTT
            She seeing another fella...?
                 (as he moves closer, confidingly)
            ...just between us. Off-the-
            record, son...

ANGLE, INT. THE VAN. We hear the conversation, and see the
tape machine moving.

                      SCOTT (V.O.)
            ...I was young once, too.

                      BLAKE (V.O.)
            I...

ANGLE EXT. THE VAN. Blake and Scott.

                                                          25.


                      SCOTT
            I know that nothing hurts worse
            than that. She seeing another
            guy...?

                      BLAKE
            I...
                 (pause)
            There's this, um...Teacher...I
            shouldn't, I, I shouldn't tell
            you this: She...

                      SCOTT
            She sleeping with a teacher...?

                      BLAKE
            She says she isn't. I said she
            looked like a slut. She wants to
            fuck old guys, she should go to
            The Regency. Go all the Way.

                      SCOTT
            The Regency, what's that?

                      BLAKE
                 (as if everyone knows
                 this place)
            S'the Club, by the Fenway...it's
            like a joke at school, it's like
            a rumor: this or that girl, made
            a thousand bucks, went with a
            businessman for One Night...
            Look: it's a Lover's Quarrel. I
            said something I regret. I sent
            her a note which I regret, and I
            assure, you, Officer. If...
                 (pause)
            If you would...

ANGLE. From inside the windshield of the van we see, through
their body language, that Scott is "giving the boy a break",
the boy is very thankful. Scott is admonishing him and the
boy is contrite. Now Scott begins to walk away, and we see
him minutely, signal to the van, we see the driver of the
van pick up a phone and speak softly into it.

ANGLE, Scott, walking down a sidestreet. The boy in the BG,
we see the young Asian girl, take up a tailing position some
half-block back of the boy, as a car glides to the curb. And
Scott gets in.

ANGLE, tight on Scott in the car, as he rubs his eyes,
beyond exhaustion. The car pulls away.

                                                          26.


He gives several instructions to the young man driving, and
then leans back, eyes closed. He opens his eyes again, and
we see him mouth, insistently, "The Regency". The driver nods.

INT. BOATHOUSE. NIGHT.

As Scott enters. The activity is more widespread than
previously. An agent walks him into the fray.

                      AGENT
            No morgue. No hospital. No note.

                      SCOTT
            The parents?

Agent, nods, shrugs.

                      AGENT
            The mother,
                 (makes a "drinking" gesture)
            You know where she is...He's
            holding up...
                 (as an afterthought)
            He was in town yesterday. To see
            her.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he shakes his
                 head - to clear it)
            He was?

                      AGENT
            ...we snuck him in, and out.

We see Miller, in the BG, in a hurried conference, nod at Scott.

                      MILLER
                 (looking at a chart)
            "The Colophon - 36-foot sloop".
            Where is she...?

They walk off, an Aide talking to him.

                      AIDE
            ...the Coast Guard has a watch
            over this area:
                 (he points to the chart)
            And they have scheduled the
            Colophon first...

Scott and the Agent stop in front of the interrogation room,
where we see the agent, Gaines, a guard over him. Gaines is
sitting, looking as if he had been weeping. The guard
addresses Scott and the other agent.

                                                             27.


                      GUARD
            He copped to it.

                      SCOTT
            He copped to what?

                      GUARD
                 (of Gaines)
            Off-post - punched out early to
            go boffing his girlfriend.

Scott shakes his head as if to say "How about that..." The
agent holds a photo of a very lovely Eurasian woman in a
business suit, and shows it to Scott.

                      AGENT
            Hope she was worth it...

                      SCOTT
            Uh huh.

Scott stands wearily, watching several large men berating
the seated Secret Service Agent. An agent appears with a
tearsheet showing the ad for "The Regency Club". We see the
ad for exotic young companions, and the address is Boston.
Scott gives instructions to the Aide.

ANGLE INT. WASHROOM. Scott, having stripped off his shirt,
is washing himself at the sink. The "Regency" ad, and a
description of the club is pasted with water to the mirror
before him. We read, in the mirror: "REGENCY. 243 Charles
Street, Boston, Mass. Owners of Record..." Et Cetera. In the
mirror we see the Aide bring a fresh shirt and a tie to
Scott. Scott turns, as the door swings, and he sees, in the
BG, ANTON, just entering the establishment.

ANGLE INT. THE BOATHOUSE. A Swat team is laying out its
weapons and assault gear, on a long table.

HOLD on Anton, who is standing, unassigned, and looking it.

We see, on an improvised bulletin board, photos of the Boy,
Blake, the Professor, and the Girl, blown up from a
newspaper shot, and in various photos. As we watch an Agent
walks up with a box full of photos, and tacks one up on the
board. It is an altered shot showing the young girl with
short, spikey platinum hair.

ANGLE on Scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takes
a photo from the box. We see him put it next to the original,
blonde photo, and look at both.

                                                            28.


                      AGENT
            We ran it up from a description
            of the colorist from the Beauty
            Parlor...

                      SCOTT
            Gimme your coat.

The Agent takes off his suitcoat, and gives it to Scott, who
puts it on.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he holds the photos, and the Regency
description. He walks toward the door, through the mass of
agents. He stops by Miller, who is on the phone, looking at
a photograph of the Professor, as a tech hooks up a video
feed of a house on the water, the Professor's house. A photo
of a sailboat is tacked up. We read 'The Colophon' on its stern.

                      SCOTT
                 (to Miller)
            I need five thousand dollars.

Miller gestures "Just a Moment", and then waves to an Aide,
meaning "Do It".

                      SCOTT
            How long do we have? Sir?

                      MILLER
                 (shakes his head)
            It hits the papers, and we're done.

                      SCOTT
            No...note? No...

Miller shakes his head, he holds up the "Regency" note...

                      SCOTT
                 (nodding)
            I've got it...
                 (to Miller)
            Can I have some backup?

Miller, gesturing around the room, meaning "what you see is
what you get". All the occupants of the room are engaged on
some task, save Anton, who sits alone on a bench. Scott
looks at Anton, who glances at Scott, trying to keep the
appeal out of his glance, "Please take me".

                      SCOTT
                 (to Anton)
            We're scraping the bottom of the
            barrel here, aren't we?

                                                             29.


                        ANTON
            Yes. Sir.

Scott looks at Anton and shakes his head. He is summoned to
the front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash
into an envelope. Scott comes over to her, and we see her
filling out a slip of paper. She hands him the cash in the
envelope, and the slip of paper.

                      YOUNG WOMAN
            I need you to sign it.

                      SCOTT
            You sign it.
                 (He scans the room
                 again, shrugs, and
                 motions to Anton)
            Come on, Wallflower...
                 (Anton rises and walks
                 over to him)


Scott turns to Anton.

                      SCOTT
            Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes
            open, and form on me...Here's
            where we're going...

There is the sound of a gunshot. Scott and Anton
instinctively take cover against the side of the building,
drawing their sidearms.

HOLD TIGHT on Scott. As he looks through the half-open door.

We see several of the Swat men, taking up positions, one of
them kicks open a door, and his partner enters. Pause. We
hear the partner call "clear".

ANGLE, on Scott, as he re-enters the building, and proceeds,
pistol out, toward the room.

ANGLE HIS POV. On the floor, we see the dead Secret Service
Agent, a pistol in his hand.

We see Miller turn to his team. An Agent kneels to the
fallen Secret Service Agent, and prods a small hideout
pistol from his hand. Scott turns to leave, and sees Anton
standing next to him.

                                                            30.


                      SCOTT
            Don't look at him. Don't look at
            the Downed Man. He's dead...
                 (as he turns his back
                 on the scene)
            Kick the fool overboard...

ANGLE on Anton and Scott as they leave. In the BG we see
Miller et al. Miller giving directions.

                      MILLER
            ...who is the girl he went to
            see? Get her in...The girl he
            was fucking...Who's got the
            Coastguard...

TIGHT on Anton and Scott as they exit the building.

                      SCOTT
            I'd hate to be the Lucky Duck
            who frisked him...
                 (beat)


                      ANTON
            He was off-post when they
            snatched the girl?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks at the
                 fallen agent)
            Yeah. Well, apparently, he felt
            bad about it...

EXT. REGENCY CLUB. NIGHT.

A garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting,
getting into their limo. Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up
to the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to
the club. We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his
watch, meaning "closing up".

ANGLE INS. Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the
bouncer.

ANGLE, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on.

ANGLE INT. THE REGENCY CLUB. Several well-dressed couples
are leaving. A group of raucous, drunk businessmen types
push past them. Scott walks up to the bar. The Bartender is
beginning to ring out the cash register. In the BG we see a
manager eye Scott, and continue to direct the closing
operations.

                                                          31.


                      BARTENDER
            Closing up...
                 (he points to his watch)
            Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.

                      SCOTT
                 (laying money on the bar)
            No, no. I just came buy to pay
            you that money I owe you.

He gestures to the bills on the bar. The Bartender swoops
them up, and gestures to the back bar, meaning "What'll you
have?" Scott points to a bottle of Bourbon, the Bartender
pours for him.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he drinks)
            ...how about them Sox, huh...?

                      BARTENDER
            Yuh. Whaddaya gonna do...?

                      SCOTT
            "Curse of the Bambino".

                      BARTENDER
            ...that's right.
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Nice place you got here.

                      BARTENDER
            You from out of town...?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, you know, actually, I was
            just looking for my Daughter...

                      BARTENDER
                 (as he smiles)
            ...that's what you're looking
            for...?

                      SCOTT
            ...I. Uhh...

                      BARTENDER
            ...ask, because a lot of out-of-
            town guys, come in, lookin,
            someone else's daughter.

                                                           32.


                      SCOTT
            No, I...Oh, no...

                      BARTENDER
                 (smiling)
            You sure...?

                      SCOTT
            Abso, absolutely...

He brings out his case, with the photo of the platinum-
haired girl. The Bartender comes over and glances at it.

ANGLE XCU on Scott as he looks incisively at the Bartender,
who displays no flicker of recognition.

                      SCOTT
            ...girl like that been in
            tonight...?

                      BARTENDER
            ...pretty girl...

                      SCOTT
            None prettier.

ANGLE on Scott, who looks around the club. We see him eyeing
the lovely young scantily clad waitresses, who return his
looks with disdain. The Bartender, observing him, comes back
to him.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah...I'm looking for a girl
            like that...

                      BARTENDER
            ...You're sure it was your
            daughter...? B'cause, a lot of
            guys, come in here, guys your
            age, go home with some...some
            rather 'younger' girl...

The Bartender smiles.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he leans forward)
            Well, why would a, one of these
            'younger girls'. What would they
            want to do with me...?

The Bartender leans close and hesitates. Scott takes out
several more bills and passes them to the Bartender.

                                                               33.


He hesitates a second, as if to say   "You wouldn't fuck me,
would you...?" The Bartender signs,   "I am your man", the
Bartender takes the bills and leans   close and whispers to
Scott, indicating someone over in a   dark corner.

In this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see a
youngish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American,
dressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we saw
earlier was the Manager. As Scott approaches, we see the
Manager, knowingly, drift off. Beat. The young man (ZIMMER)
rises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, and
stops, as if bemused by Scott.

                      ZIMMER
            'Howdy, Pard'.

                       SCOTT
            Hello. I wonder if you could
            help me...

                      ZIMMER
                 (as he yawns and looks
                 at his watch, as he
                 pushes past Scott)
            I love you, Baby, but the
            season's over...

Zimmer starts for the front door, and Scott falls into step
with him.

                      SCOTT
                 (gestures at the Bartender)
            ...my friend says that
            you're...you're sort of a
            'matchmaker'...

                      ZIMMER
            Izzat what he says...?

Camera takes the two out of the front of   the club, where
Zimmer tips the bouncer, who his putting   on his coat,
preparatory to going away for the night.   Zimmer begins
walking into a parking lot, where we see   several run-down
employee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime   Mercedes. Scott
tags along.

                      BOUNCER
                 (as he walks away, to
                 Zimmer, of Zimmer's car)
            I put her back in your space...

                      SCOTT
            I was looking for a girl...a
            young girl...

                                                             34.


                      ZIMMER
            Aren't we all.

                      SCOTT
            My, my, my, my, my, my question
            was: why would a young girl want
            to go out with an older man like
            me? And, if you could "answer"
            that...

He takes out money from his pocket. Zimmer begins to speak
slightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'.

                      ZIMMER
            Look, Bub...

Zimmer starts to open his car door. He turns back to Scott,
and we see, Zimmer's POV, Anton, standing behind Scott, at
the doorway to an alleyway. Obviously backing Scott up.

ANGLE CU, Zimmer reacts infinitesimally, to the sight of Anton.

ANGLE XCU, Scott, sees him, and slams him against the side
of the car. Zimmer reaches through the half-open door, and
comes out with an automatic pistol in his hand. Scott kicks
him in the stomach, Zimmer tries to raise the hand with the
gun, and Scott throws him to the ground, the pistol falls on
the concrete.

ANGLE on Scott as Anton emerges from the alley. Scott
directs him to drag Zimmer into the alleyway, near a
dumpster. Anton thrusts his hand into the car and starts to
reach for the dropped pistol.

                      SCOTT
            Don't touch the piece, don't
            touch the piece, don't touch the
            piece, th'out your gloves on...

ANGLE INT. THE SMALL ALLEYWAY. As Anton now pulls off
Zimmer's sportcoat, and begins emptying the pockets. Scott
interrogates Zimmer.

                      ZIMMER
            ...I think you broke my arm.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he shows the photo
                 to Zimmer)
            You seen this girl before...

                      ZIMMER
                 (of his arm)
            ...I think it's broken...

                                                          35.


                      SCOTT
            You seen her tonight...?

Zimmer turns away from the photo.

                      ZIMMER
            ...I think it's...

                      SCOTT
                 (to Anton)
            Pull him up...

Anton pulls Zimmer to his feet. Scott puts a lock on Zimmer
and breaks his arm. Zimmer screams.

                      SCOTT
            Now it's broken.
                 (of the picture)
            What's her name...?
                 (pause. He strikes
                 Zimmer in the face)
            WHAT'S HER NAME...
                 (to Anton)
            Break his other arm...

                      ZIMMER
            I DON'T KNOW HER NAME...

                      SCOTT
            You don't know her name, then
            who is she...?

                      ZIMMER
            Some, some 'girl'...

                      SCOTT
            Some 'girl', some 'pal' of yours?
            Where is she Now...?

Anton, tossing Zimmer's coat, comes up with a small medicine
vial. He holds it up to Scott. Who takes it, looks at it,
sniffs it. Pause.

                      SCOTT
                 (to Zimmer)
            Oh no...
                 (pause)
            Oh no...this isn't Rohypnol...
                 (pause)
            Is it...?
                 (pause)
            Izziz Rohypnol? Is this "Rho"?
                 (pause)
            IZZIZ A ONE-SIDED CONVERSATION...?
                 (to Anton)
            Whatzisname?

                                                            36.


                      ANTON
                 (looking at his
                 driver's license)
            Donny Zimmer.

                      SCOTT
            Donny. Donny: where's the girl...?
                 (pause)
            You dose her...?
                 (pause)
            Where is she? Donny...?

Anton tossing Zimmer's clothes comes up with an envelope.
Scott takes it, and leafs through many bills.

                      SCOTT
            ...what is this? Ten, what is it,
            Fifteen thou...? For what...?

                      ZIMMER
            I never saw that girl...

                      SCOTT
            Oh, alright, then we've got to
            let you go...

ANGLE CU, Scott.

                      SCOTT
            Where'd you take the girl,
            Donny...?
                 (pause. Silence. To Anton)
            You touch his piece?

                      ANTON
            No.

                      SCOTT
            Good.

Scott gestures to Anton to let Zimmer go. Zimmer hesitates,
knowing he must not move. Scott holds the photo to Zimmer's
face.

                      ZIMMER
            THAT'S NOT THE GIRL...THAT'S NOT
            THE GIRL!

                                                             37.


                      SCOTT
            That's not what girl...?
                 (pause)
            Where'd you take her...?
                 (Scott points to
                 Zimmer's pistol. To Anton)
            Put your glove on. Pick up his
            pistol. Two knees, the other
            elbow,
                 (he points to the head)
            Mozambique...

ANGLE XCU, Anton looking at Scott, to say "Really"?

ANGLE XCU Scott, nodding back, "Really".

                      SCOTT
            You bet your life.

Scott starts to walk away. Zimmer begins screaming.

                      ZIMMER
            Wait...Wait...Wait...

EXT. NORTH END, BOSTON QUIET STREET. NIGHT.

A large Mercedes is parked outside on the quiet street. A
chauffeur reads the paper, he half turns, sleepily, at the
sight of a man walking across the street.

ANGLE Scott and Anton pulling up in a Camaro.

ANGLE INT. THE CAMARO. Scott and Anton, as he turns off the
motor. He looks over at Anton, who holds a piece of paper.

ANGLE THEIR POV. A townhouse across the street. A large
Mercedes in the courtyard driveway. Beat. Scott and Anton
watch, as a door starts to open.

                      SCOTT
            ...okay, then...

Anton begins to respond, when Scott gets out of the car,
motioning Anton toward the Mercedes.

ANGLE EXT. THE TOWNHOUSE. We see a middle-aged Businessman
coming out of a side entrance, adjusting his clothes as he
walks. As Scott walks nearby - we take him to a garbage pail,
where he retrieves a small black bag - that is, as used to
transport dog shit. He walks up.

ANGLE, on Anton, getting out of the Camaro. Behind him,
around the corner, we see a dark van pull up. Anton motions
the van to hold.

                                                             38.


ANGLE, on Scott. As he walks up toward the Businessman,
holding the black bag. He whistles once or twice for his dog,
and then turns to see the Businessman.

                      SCOTT
            ...beautiful night...

                      BUSINESSMAN
                 (nods)
            'Less you got hayfever...
                 (he gestures at the
                 flowering trees)


Scott walks up to him, and pushes him back into the vestibule.

ANGLE TIGHT on Scott as he flicks open his switchblade, and
holds his knife up to the Businessman's throat and whispers.

                      SCOTT
            ...you left something back inside.

Beat. The Businessman looks frantically around, beyond him
we see Anton taking his Chauffeur out of the car. The
Businessman turns to the intercom and pushes a button. We
hear a female voice answer, after a beat, "...yes...?"

ANGLE on Anton, holding a machine pistol, behind a corner of
the wall.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            ...I left my case inside.

There is a beat. And the far door in the vestibule is buzzed
open. As it opens several men in Swat gear stream through
the vestibule and up the stairs. Scott hands the Businessman
over to an Agent, who takes charge of him, and camera holds
on Scott, standing, wearily, at the bottom of the stairs.

He motions for Anton near him to hand him a cigarette. Anton
does so. Scott lights up. From the top of the stairs we hear
screams, sounds of breaking, yells, commands being shouted.

Beat. An Agent comes to the top of the stairs, looks down,
and shakes his head. Beat. Scott turns and finds the
handcuffed Businessman in his field of vision.

                      SCOTT
            ...they got some young girls up
            there...?

Beat. The Businessman, terrified, is silent. Scott holds out
the photo of the girl in the black hair.

                                                             39.


                         SCOTT
               You see this girl...?
                    (pause)


The Businessman looks at the photo. Scott gestures at Anton,
and passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton. And then
looks as if to say "In or Out?" Anton hesitates a moment,
and then strikes the Businessman.

                         ANTON
               Did you See This Girl...?

ANGLE on the Businessman, on the ground. Terrified. He looks
back at Scott, as if unable to focus. Scott gives him a beat,
nods, as if to say, "What would you expect", and starts up
the stairs.

INT. WHOREHOUSE. NIGHT.

Scott enters the vaguely Japanese modern establishment.
Several Swat figures are being stood down. They sit, sharing
a thermos of coffee. One of the Swat team nods to Scott, and
motions him to the direction he knows Scott wants to go.

Camera takes Scott past a room where two female Agents are
holding five young women, who are supervised, changing out
of "escort" wear, and into jeans and sweatshirts,
"streetclothes".

ANGLE on Scott, as he enters what is obviously the "office"
of the Bordello. One of the techs is sitting at a bashed-in
computer, he is hooking it up to another laptop. He turns to
Scott.

                         TECH
               ...she was trying to scrub the
               thing...

Beyond them we see Miller. And a very attractive European-
looking woman in her forties. In a room beyond two bodyguard
types are handcuffed, watched over by a Swat officer.

Scott moves back to watch Miller interrogating the woman,
the Madam, who speaks with a middle-European accent.

                         MADAM
               ...an escort service. There is
               no impropriety, and there is no...

                                                            40.


                      MILLER
                 (calling back to one
                 of his techs, who
                 consults a computer)
            ...who is she?

                      TECH
            ...Nadya Tellich, Serb. Green
            Card, in...

Miller waves the rest of the information away. Miller shows
her the photo.

                      MILLER
            Have you seen this girl...?

                      NADYA
            We see a lot of girls. They apply.
            For the job, as Hostesses...

ANGLE on Scott, who stands by the Tech, who is trying to
reconstruct the broken computer. It prints out a file, on
which we see photos of various faces. Each girl holds a
placard with a number on it.

ANGLE on Anton, who looks down.

ANGLE HIS POV. The wastebasket. In the BG we hear Nadya
going on about the benefits of working as a Hostess. He
motions to Scott.

Scott squats to the ground, and pours out what are revealed
to be several polaroids of beautiful young women. He uses
his knife to rearrange them without touching them. They are
now alighted and we see the numerals twelve, thirteen,
fifteen, on placards which they hold up.

ANGLE on Scott, as he walks back into the interrogation room,
holding the sheet printed out by the computer.

                      NADYA
            ...a contact for Personal
            Services...They pay us so much
            for each call, and...The girls
            pay us! We are just a -

                      MILLER
            They show you proof of their age...

                      NADYA
            Of course, of course, I...you
            think I...What do you think, I...

                                                           41.


                      SCOTT
                 (showing her the printout)
            Where's Number Fourteen?
                 (pause)


                      NADYA
            ...I don't understand you.

                      SCOTT
            ...where's Number Fourteen?
                 (pause)


                      NADYA
                 (pause)
            I want my Lawyer...

Miller takes the photos of Laura and shows the platinum-
haired one to Nadya.

                      MILLER
            ...is this the Girl? Is this her?
            Was she in here?

                      NADYA
            I, wait, I no...I...I want to
            talk to my lll...

                       MILLER
                 (of the platinum-haired
                 girl)
            Izzat her? It's her, isn't it.
            She was here. Is that her...?

ANGLE, on Scott, as he steps away. He takes us through the
Whorehouse. In the adjacent room we see a bank of video
monitors, showing people in various sexual activities. On
the screen for a moment comes the face of what looks like a
very young girl indeed, camera swerves onto the face of the
Businessman we saw outside the Whorehouse, he is disrobing,...

                      BUSINESSMAN (ON TAPE)
            ...come over here, you little
            bitch...That's right, get your
            sweet ass over here...

ANGLE on Scott. As he looks to the Businessman, himself, who
is seated in a chair, presided over by several agents,
forced to watch the video. He turns his head away.

                      SCOTT
                 (to an Agent)
            Make him watch it.

                                                             42.


One of the agents turns the Businessman's head brusquely back.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...I...listen...listen: I'm a
            wealthy man. I am, I am not-
            without-friends in, in the
            Administration...
                 (he takes out a
                 business card and hands
                 it to Scott)
            ...whatever it takes to...

                      SCOTT
            This here, sir. This is a piece
            of cardboard.

Scott holds the card. He shakes his head sadly. Scott nods
to the Interrogator and Scott throws the card into the
Businessman's lap.

                       INTERROGATOR
                 (as the Businessman
                 starts to look away)
            Don't you look away, you son of
            a bitch...
                 (he forces him to watch
                 the video)


ANGLE CU, on Scott, as he looks disgusted. Anton stands on
one side, looking to Scott for a cue as to how to react.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...I...I...

                      SCOTT
                 (stepping in)
            "I-I-I" - What are you, Carmen
            Miranda...?

He holds the photo of the platinum-haired Laura Newton.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...
                 (he draws Scott close,
                 turning from Anton to
                 the "good" cop)
            Listen to me: I cannot. Be caught
            here. You write an amount on a
            sheet of paper...write it on my
            card...
                      (MORE)

                                                          43.


                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                 (he takes out his
                 business card and hands
                 it to Scott)


                      SCOTT
            No, Baby. Today we got the Barter
            System. And you best pray to God
            you got something to trade...

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...I...
                 (he takes out his wallet)


                      SCOTT
            IT AIN'T MONEY. YOU SICK FATCAT
            FOOL. WHERE IS THE GIRL...?
                 (he slaps the
                 Businessman, and Anton
                 pulls him off)
            LEAVE ME ALONE, I'LL GET THE
            TRUTH OUT OF HIM...
                 (he picks up the man's
                 business card)
            Come in here, try to buy me off?
            I've got Three Daughters...

Anton succeeds in pulling Scott off the Businessman. He
drags him around a corner. We see the terrified Businessman
in the background, as Anton tries to reason with Scott.

                      ANTON
            ...maybe we'd...

ANGLE, on Scott, now appearing transformed, and easy. He
gestures "shusshh" to Anton, meaning "It is all an act". In
the BG we see the Interrogator browbeating the Businessman.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks down at
                 the Businessman's card,
                 and shakes his head.
                 He moves back toward
                 the Businessman,
                 terrifying him)
            ...I thought when you wanted to
            pet little girls, you picked on
            your Daughter...Ain't that what
            you rich people do...now you
            step off the Reservation and you
            want to buy me?
                      (MORE)

                                                          44.


                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
                 (he shows a photo of
                 the platinum-haired
                 Laura to the Businessman)
            Where Is This Girl...

The Businessman is terrified. He looks around the room in panic.

ANGLE on Scott, as camera takes him to where the Female
Agent is interrogating the Young Whore. Anton follows.

                      YOUNG WHORE
                 (looking at the photo
                 of Laura Newton)
            I...She was sick...she was Not
            Very Well. She came in
            here...and...and...

                      FEMALE AGENT
            ...who was she...?

                      YOUNG WHORE
            I dunno...some young girl. I
            dunno...They took her, I told
            Nadya, she shunnt be here, they
            took her...

                      FEMALE AGENT
            Who took her?

                      YOUNG WHORE
            I think that was her.

                      FEMALE AGENT
            Was she here?

                      YOUNG WHORE
            I think that's the girl...they
            took her. The two, two
            men...they...
                 (she draws the Female
                 Agent closer, frightened)
            ...they gave her a shot...

ANGLE on Scott, as he turns back to Nadya.

                      NADYA
            I am entitled to my rights, and
            I am entitled to a phonecall to
            my lll...

                                                             45.


                      SCOTT
                 (brusquely)
            Your lawyer ain't going to help
            you...want to guess 'why'?
                 (he looks to Miller,
                 who nods, "Go ahead".
                 he takes the photo of
                 Laura with the red
                 hair, sharply, from
                 Miller and shows it to Nadya)
            Y'understand the picture...

                      NADYA
            ...ohmigod...

ANGLE on Miller, as he beckons Scott. Anton starts to come
and Miller signals him to stay behind.

                      SCOTT
            He's with me...

Miller nods and the three walk out of the room.

ANGLE on Scott, as he and Miller retreat behind a door. Beat.

                      MILLER
                 (as it dawns on him)
            They don't know who they've
            got...they just snatched "some
            Young Girl". When they find out,
            they're going to have to...

Scott moves back to Nadya.

                      SCOTT
            She was here. She was here, where
            is she...? WHERE IS SHE?
                 (Scott thrusts the
                 Laura Newton photo at her)
            She was here -

                      NADYA
            ...I...I don't know if this is
            the...

                      SCOTT
            She was here.
                 (pause)

                                                           46.


                       NADYA
                  (very softly, as she
                  looks around, broken,
                  for sympathy)
             ...they'll kill me.

                       SCOTT
             Who did you call. How did they
             know, to come get her?

                       NADYA
             I...it's just a number, I...

Miller pushes a pad of paper and a pencil across to her.

ANGLE TIGHT on Scott. As he looks on. Beat. He nods, as if
to say "We're getting there". There is the sound of a phone
ringing, and an Agent comes in, and beckons Miller, who
waves him away. The Agent indicates, "No, you have to take
this call." Miller steps back from Nadya, not wanting to
break the mood, and moves toward the phone. Scott moves to
stand by the girl.

ANGLE on Scott as he pushes the paper toward her, again,
forcing and willing her to put down the number.

                       MILLER
                  (softly. To phone)
             ...hello...

INT. FOOTBALL STADIUM. NIGHT.

A helicopter is settling onto the playing field.

ANGLE. Two men getting out of a Suburban, across the field,
run toward the helicopter.

ANGLE, a powerful-looking older man in a suit, BURCH, steps
down from the helicopter, and an Aide greets him and leads
him away from the helicopter. We see the Aide indicate the
two men running toward them. Burch turns.

ANGLE HIS POV. Miller and Scott, who join with Burch, as
they all move toward the stadium building.

INT. STADIUM BUILDING, LUNCHROOM. NIGHT.

ANGLE, on an assembly of the information of the chase. On a
table, the photos of the Eurasian businesswoman, of Laura
Newton, of the Regency Club. A disassembled machine pistol,
and a cup of steaming coffee.

HOLD on Scott, looking at something, off. As he picks up the
cup of coffee. Beyond him we see Anton, asleep in his chair.

                                                            47.


ANGLE INT. LUNCHROOM. Burch, Scott, and Miller are found in
the empty, stainless steel lunchroom, with them a clean-cut
young man, STODDARD, obviously Burch's assistant.

                      BURCH
            ...where's the girl...?

                      MILLER
            Sir, we believe she was abducted,
            from this club...
                 (as Miller speaks he
                 passes pertinent sheets
                 of information to Burch)
            That she was taken to...that she
            was taken to a bordello...

                      BURCH
            ...here in Boston...

                      MILLER
            Yessir, and, that...that...

                      BURCH
            Come on, let's hear it:

                      MILLER
            That she may have been...that
            she may have been delivered -
            for sale - that she may have
            been sent down the pipeline and
            overseas.
                 (pause)


                      BURCH
                 (pause)
            "...just some girl..."
                 (pause)


ANGLE. HOLD on Scott. Sitting quietly, as he watches the two
other men.

Stoddard takes out a cigar case. Looks to Burch, who nods
his consent, and Stoddard takes out a black cigar, and
lights it.

                      BURCH
            How certain are you she was the
            girl in the whorehouse?

                                                             48.


                      MILLER
                 (shakes his head,
                 meaning "not positive")
            ...we...

                      BURCH
            Was the girl in the whorehouse?
                 (pause)
            What about your other
            leads?...the Boyfriend,
            the...Professor...?

                      MILLER
            ...sir.

                      STODDARD
            The Professor, where's his boat?

                      MILLER
            The Coast Guard is on the...

                      STODDARD
            WHERE IS THE FUCKEN BOAT? IS SHE
            ON THE BOAT...

ANGLE on Scott and Anton. As Anton comes awake to the sound
of the shouting. Scott gestures him to keep quiet.

ANGLE on the two. As Anton wakes up. He picks up a sheet
bearing the Picasso symbol, and starts to speak. Scott
shakes his head, meaning "be quiet".

                      SCOTT
            ...we just go where we're sent
            and do what we're told when we
            get there...

He motions to be quiet - and to pay attention to the drama
in the next room.

ANGLE INT. THE STEEL LUNCHROOM. As Burch and Stoddard
interrogate Miller.

                      BURCH
            You've got the fucken Service
            Agent, shot himself...you're
            you're telling me, your best bet,
            some cocksuckers nabbed her,
            took her, took her, they don't
            know who she is. And they're
            gonna sell her down the river...?

                      MILLER
            Sir...

                                   49.


          BURCH
The Detail Agent. Was he fucking
her?

            MILLER
The girl?

          BURCH
The Secret Service Agent, was he
fucking Laura Newton...?

          MILLER
He was off-post, with his
girlfriend.
     (pause)


           STODDARD
     (as he holds up the
     "Picasso" letter from
     the Boyfriend, to read
     it. He reads:)
The Professor, the Boyfriend,
"...you behave like a slut...",
this is who you like...?
     (he holds up the
     advertisement of the
     Regency Club)
Aah...fuck
     (he holds up the photo
     of her hair)
She dyed her hair. What do they
do, her hair grows out, what do
they do when they realize who
she is...?
     (pause)


          SCOTT
     (under his breath, not
     realizing he's speaking)
They kill her.

          BURCH
     (reacting, as if to
     say, "That's the first
     sensible thing I've heard")
You're fucken A Right they kill
her. Okay. Good.
          (MORE)

                                                          50.


                      BURCH (CONT'D)
            Now: Let's talk some commonsense:
                 (pause)
            What can you do for me?
                 (to Miller)
            ...who is that...?
                 (Miller whispers to
                 Burch. To Scott)
            ...Get in here...
                 (Scott comes and stands
                 by Burch)


Scott, and then Miller, looks at Burch's clean-cut and very
fit assistant, Stoddard. There is a pause, and then Burch
motions Stoddard to leave the room, which he does. Pause.

                      BURCH
                 (quietly)
            ...what can you do for me? What
            can you do for me - I need it
            now - I need it before the Press
            gets it on Monday. Cause they
            will kill her. The jackals start
            a feeding frenzy, and she's red.
            Help me.

Miller nods to an Aide, who comes forward, with a white
scrap of paper. He hands it to Burch.

                      MILLER
            Sir: This is the number of a
            public phone in Downtown Boston.
                 (Burch nods)
            It's a cutout, between the
            Bordello, and the abductors. A
            call is placed when they have a
            package to deliver.

                      BURCH
            ...you going to stake out the
            phone...?

                       MILLER
                 (nods)
            We have a watch on the phone.
            More importantly: N.S.A. reports
            calls placed to that phone.
            Regularly.

                      BURCH
            They can track calls to a payphone?

                                                             51.


                      MILLER
            In this case they can.

                      BURCH
            How?

                      MILLER
            They were made from a Federal
            Prison.
                 (he gestures to the
                 Aide, who shows to
                 Burch and the camera a
                 photo of a smiling man
                 in his forties, in an
                 expensive suit. Of photo:)
            This is Eli Assani. He is a
            Lebanese National, serving life
            without, for kidnapping. He was
            the head man in a white slavery
            scheme.

                      BURCH
            And where is he?

                      MILLER
            He's in Lewisberg. We have a
            Plan...
                 (pause)
            I hesitate to...

                      BURCH
            Give it to me...

ANGLE, on an Aide who comes in and passes a piece of paper
to Miller, who reads it and looks up.

                      MILLER
            They've got some action on the
            Payphone...

Scott and Anton start to get to their feet.

EXT. COPLEY SQUARE, DOWNTOWN. NIGHT.

In the foreground we see a lonely payphone in the deserted
square. It is festooned with ads for escort services. In the
deep background we see the lights on in a corner bank
building, and the cleaners at work.

ANGLE INT. THE BANK. One of the cleaners polishes the
counter in the bank. He wipes his brow and looks outside.

ANGLE HIS POV. A sedan at the curb. Beyond it, a man,
smoking a cigarette, stands near the payphone.

                                                             52.


The man looks at his watch, looks around, throws away the
cigarette, and continues to pace.

ANGLE, in the bank the "Cleaner" whispers into a lapel mike.

EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Scott, in the backseat of a car, apparently asleep. Anton,
sitting in the front. Listening to the faint sounds from an
earwig.

ANGLE, XCU. Scott, his head tilted back, looking through
almost fully closed eyelids.

                      SCOTT
            ...who's walking up on us...?

ANGLE, Anton, as he looks around, down at Scott, and then up,
at a man in a suit, some thirty yards away, walking towards
the car.

Anton, as the man draws closer, looks down at Scott, as if
to say "How did you know"?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he loosens his
                 jacket, over his pistol)
            ...who is he?

                      ANTON
            Boston. P.D.

We see Scott, relax for a moment. And then, putting Anton
out of his misery.

                      SCOTT
            ...always a reflective surface...
                 (then, to himself, as
                 if reciting a litany)
            "...in the city, always a
            reflection. In the Woods. Always
            a sound..."

HOLD. On Anton, as he digests this. BEAT.

                      ANTON
            ...and in the Desert?

                      SCOTT
            You don't want to go into the
            desert.

ANGLE, EXT. The Phonebooth in Copley Square. We hear the
phone begin to ring.

                                                             53.


EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Scott and Anton, in the sedan. Anton listening on the
earpiece. Anton brightens.

                      ANTON
            ...they're moving...

Anton starts to put the car in gear, an Agent comes jogging
down the street, out of an alley, and motions Anton aside,
and gets into the car.

EXT. BOSTON HIGHWAY. NIGHT.

A shot of the helicopter, flying over the highway.

ANGLE, the sedan speeding down the deserted highway, the
city in the background. The helicopter, flying away overhead.

INT. SCOTT'S CAR.

A Driver, Scott, and Anton. Listening to transmissions on
the radio. As they drive Anton leans forward, his hands on
the seatback of the front seat. Scott picks up one of
Anton's hands, and turns it over.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the hand)
            ...what is this...?

                      ANTON
                 (as he looks down, and
                 then realizes the
                 nature of the question)
            ...it's a wedding ring.

                      SCOTT
            ...take it off.
                 (pause. While Anton
                 hesitates, not comprehending)
            ...the ring clicks against your
            riflestock, some sonobitch hears
            that noise, hundred yards out,
            and you're gonna get me killed.

Anton nods, and begins to work the ring off his finger.

ANGLE THEIR POV. Far ahead, the speeding sedan turns off the
highway, onto a "feeder" road.

Anton and Scott in the backseat. As we see Anton take out a
machine pistol from his "Go" bag, and check it. Scott looks
at him. A chatter comes over the radio, and Scott addresses
the two men in the front seat.

                                                             54.


                      SCOTT
            ...where's he going...?

The Driver hands a printout to the shotgun man, who reads.

                      AGENT
            One Five Four Nine, Alpha Sierra,
            Mass Reg. William Barak.
            Somerville, Mass...

                      SCOTT
            That's where he's going?

The Agent shakes his head, looks down at the paper.

                      AGENT
            Also, owner of Record, In Essex...

                      SCOTT
            Izzey going toward Essex?
                 (Agent nods)
            ...what sort of place is it...?

The Agent looks at the piece of paper.

                      AGENT
            It...it'd be a Beach house...

                      SCOTT
            Get me there.
                 (to the Driver)
            Get on the net. Call 'em off.
            Everyone off. Just me.
                 (of Anton)
            Just me and him.

                        DRIVER
            ...sir...

                       SCOTT
            Nobody out there...
                 (to Anton)
            Just. Him.
                 (to the Driver)
            You indicate that you heard me.
                 (beat. The Driver nods)
            Put it out.
                 (the Driver begins to
                 speak softly, relaying
                 his instructions on
                 the radio. Scott turns
                 to Anton. Softly)
            How you doing bright eyes...?
                 (Anton nods. Beat, as
                 Scott looks him over)

                                                            55.


                      SCOTT
            ...breathe through your nose.

Anton looks at Scott inquisitively, not sure he has heard right.

                      SCOTT
            It stills the heartrate.
                 (pause)
            You got my back.

                      ANTON
            Sir, Yes, Sir.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            ...alright, then...

ANGLE the Sedan, on the deserted highway. HOLD. We see
another car come screaming up behind it, doing one-ten, a
red light on the roof, flashing.

ANGLE INT. THE SEDAN. A middle-aged man watches the other
car come up, and disappear around a bend, going furiously fast.

EXT. ESSEX BEACH. NIGHT.

The margin of the scrubwoods, in the dunes. Scott and Anton,
moving quietly through the woods. Scott points to Anton,
indicating where he should stop.

ANGLE, Scott's POV. A run-down beach house on a deserted
cove. The blue light of a television flickering through the
window.

ANGLE, Scott peering through some scrubgrass. We see he
holds a small handful of torn-off grass before and over his
face, to break up his outline. He turns. To Anton, who
stands next to him, holding a sniper rifle. He points out a
position to Anton.

                      ANTON
            ...you want me to Come Through
            the Door...?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he checks his
                 weapons. He shakes his head.)
            Don't you go through the door
            without an Overwatch.

He takes the small handful of grass and throws it into the
air, watching the way the wind takes it. Scott gestures to
Anton to take up a position beside a small run-down boat shed.

                                                             56.


We see Anton do so, then Scott moves across the dunes, to a
small skiff. Which lies just across a little cove from the
beach house.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he moves down the dune, to the skiff. He
opens his switchblade quietly, and severs the line holding
the skiff to the dock. He gets into the skiff, and pushes it
off, and we see it begin to drift across the little cove
toward the beach house.

ANGLE, on Anton, kneeling, beside the old boat shed, as he
assumes a prone position, and sights his rifle in on the
beach house.

ANGLE, HIS POV. Through the sniperscope, the house, the
television, flickering in an empty living room.

INT. THE WOODS.

Anton, acknowledging the command. He finds a vantage point,
and assumes the prone position, covering the house with his
rifle.

ANGLE on Scott, surveying the beach house.

ANGLE HIS POV. The dark beach house.

ANGLE on Scott, as he moves across the lawn, and to a back
door. He removes his switchblade, opens it, and uses it to
jimmy the screen latch. He replaces it, and takes out a set
of lock picks, and begins to work on the door. We faintly
hear the sound of a television.

ANGLE INT. THE BEACH HOUSE. We hear the sound of the TV and
faintly, see a blue glow from a room or two down the hall.

ANGLE on Scott, entering the kitchen, where he looks down at
the various dirty plates and cups on the table.

ANGLE on Scott, coming through the door. As he moves, flat
to the wall. Camera follows him past the doorway, beyond
which we see the TV on low. Scott looks in, and finds it empty.

ANGLE on Scott, as we follow him into the bedroom. It is empty.

HOLD on Scott, looking around.

ANGLE, as he comes back into the living room. He stops. We
see something beyond him.

ANGLE HIS POV. A small boat some twenty yards from the house.
Out near the water.

                                                          57.


ANGLE, on Scott, as he starts to open the rear, sliding
glass door which will lead him out to the boat.

Behind him, we see the MAN FROM THE SEDAN open the front
door of the house, and begin to enter. Scott hears him, and
turns.

                      MAN FROM THE SEDAN
                 (as he sees Scott)
            ...what the fuck...?

                       SCOTT
            ...I heard the TV, so I came
            in...
                  (pause)


The Sedan Man is put a bit off, as the comment makes no
sense. Scott uses the moment to advance toward the man.

                      SCOTT
            ...what the hell you got the TV
            on for, there's nobody here...?
                 (the man puts up his hands)
            I don't wanna hurt you. Why would
            I hurt you? I just wanna know
            why the TV's on.

ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Where we see the man, and Scott. We
see the scene in green, through a sniperscope.

ANGLE, on Anton, looking through the scope.

ANGLE CU Anton, as he sees something in the scope.

ANGLE, in the house. Scott advancing toward the man.

                      SCOTT
            ...I just wannit to know, I just
            came to ask you that question...

The man backs up, past a half-open glass French door.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he advances toward the man.

ANGLE, ANTON'S POV. Through the sniperscope. The faint
traces of what might be the Picasso symbol.

ANGLE, on Anton, as we see him move the sniperscope and
adjust its magnification toward the symbol. In a corner of
the scope, we see another man, in a dirty white shirt,
emerge, coming up the stairs from what might be the basement
of the beach house. We see this man take in the scene in the
next room, and secrete himself behind a wall.

                                                             58.


ANGLE, on Anton, whose vision is blocked - Camera takes him
to a position next to the white tool shed.

Scott, moving toward the Sedan Man, unaware of the man
around the corner.

ANGLE through the sniperscope. We see the man in the white
shirt ready himself behind the opening through which Scott
will come. We see him raise a pistol.

ANGLE Anton, as he realizes he is behind the curve. As the
man in the white shirt steps into the doorway Anton fires at
him through the sniperscope. We see this man fall.

ANGLE, INT. THE HOUSE. The man in the Sedan, his hands
raised, fetches down a small shotgun from the lintel over
the door, and levels it toward Scott. Who draws and fires
several rounds at him.

ANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As the man goes down heavily. Scott
comes forward to the dying man, and kicks the shotgun away.

Camera takes Scott warily into the next room, where he sees
the man in the white shirt sprawled on the floor. Scott
moves past him, and down to a door leading to the basement.
Scott takes a long look down the basement stairs. We see a
faint light, and a shadow moving across the light.

ANGLE on Scott, as he takes a deep breath, and bursts down
the stairs, screaming.

ANGLE INT. The Basement. A rough, dirt-floored room. Scott
standing alone. We see a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling,
swinging slightly in the breeze from an open window.

                      SCOTT
            I'm Coming Up...

ANGLE, Anton, inside the house, in a covering position,
watching out. Scott comes up the stairs.

                      SCOTT
                 (to Anton)
            Call em in...

We see Anton take out a walkie and talk into it, Scott
proceeds to the Sedan Man. He kneels by him.

                      SCOTT
            ...where's the girl...? You're
            dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS
            THE GIRL... WHERE IS THE GIRL...

                                                             59.


Scott pulls the dying, bloody man to him, and starts to
shake him.

                      SCOTT
            You're dying. You're dying, man.
            Where is the girl...

Beat. The man begins to shudder, violently, and then stops,
obviously dead. Beat. Scott throws the dead man down onto
the floor. Beat.

ANGLE, on Anton, who turns to look back. He stares at the
dead man.

                      SCOTT
            ...well, you wanted to know...
                 (pause. Scott kicks
                 the dead man viciously)


Anton looks at Scott. Beat.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            Yeah, everybody wants to know
            the Secret Knowledge...

Scott sits on a chair, by an old rolltop desk. On the desk
we see a bunch of junk, old cigarette packets, empty. A box
half-full of yellowing stationary. Scott prods the stationary
with his knife. We read, in an insert: "Hanson Marine.
Everything for the boat. Box 38 Essex, Mass." (and see, on
the envelope, an old fashioned, stylized drawing of an old
chriscraft-like power boat).

We hear the sound of a helicopter. And Scott turns, looking
out of the window. He then turns back, to see Anton, who is
standing, looking down at the man he shot. Anton, feeling
Scott's gaze, turns to look at him.

                         ANTON
            ...I...

                      SCOTT
            ...tell it to the Chaplain.

Scott gets up wearily, and walks toward the door out onto
the beach. We see a helicopter landing, and several men in
BDU's, jumping out, and proceeding toward the house.

INT. STADIUM DRESSING ROOM. DAY.

Burch and his Aide. As Scott and Anton enter. Followed by
Miller.

                                                             60.


Burch motions Miller over, and they confer, looking at Scott
and Anton.

ANGLE, on Scott and Anton, as they stand by a television, an
Agent is watching, shaking his head.

                      BRUNETTE TALKING HEAD
            ...apparently, had her hair
            restyled, and cut today, our
            Newsteam interviewed her stylist,
            and has reconstructed...

                      SCOTT
            Ah, shit...

ANGLE. He is summoned, into the next room. By Burch et al.

Burch and his Aide. As Scott comes in with Anton, followed
by Miller. Burch takes Scott aside.

                      BURCH
                 (looking at a TV in
                 the BG silently,
                 showing photos of Laura
                 as a brunette)
            ...here's the deal:
                 (pause. He holds up a
                 photo of Eli Assani,
                 the Businessman, both
                 in a suit, and in his
                 prison garb, with a
                 number in front of him.
                 His name, and
                 "Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary")
            ...this is the man.
                 (pause, to Scott)
            ...you're covered in blood.

                      SCOTT
            Sir, it ain't mine.
                 (Burch looks at Anton.
                 Scott, seeing his glance)
            On my team, sir.

                      BURCH
            How deep is he?

                      SCOTT
                 (saying, in effect,
                 this sums it up)
            ...He's on the team.

                                                          61.


                      BURCH
            Yeah, well. He may have to be a
            little more than On the Team...
                 (pause. After considering)
            I've been speaking to the father.
                 (pause)


Burch walks a few steps away. Thinking. Scott looks at Anton,
questioning.

                      BURCH
                 (pause)
            What about if we had to go "off
            the meter"?

                      SCOTT
            ...With the Mission, sir.

Burch thinks for a moment. And then draws Scott aside. Burch
glances over at the television, spewing information about
Laura Newton, and shakes his head with disgust.

                      BURCH
                 (to himself)
            ...I'm out of time...

He turns back to Scott. And gestures him into a small room,
and closes the door.

                      BURCH
            ...man to man.

                      SCOTT
            The door's closed, Sir.

                       BURCH
            I. Need. To Ask You. To do
            something.
                 (he is hard-pressed to continue)


                      SCOTT
            I am here to get the girl back.

Burch thinks a moment, he rubs his face, and shakes his head,
and looks up as if to say "This is all we have, this is the
best we have". Pause. He nods, as they do not move.

Burch takes out a photo of a bearded middle-eastern looking
man in a business suit, and another, in a mugshot marked
"Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary".

                                                          62.


                      BURCH
            This man...Placed a phonecall.
            Yesterday. From the phonebank at
            Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone.
                 (pause)
            Here's the cut-off-point...
                 (he looks meaningfully
                 at Scott. Pause)
            ...here it is: This man, Eli
            Assani, is to be transported,
            tomorrow, Wednesday, with another
            convict. A Man on Death Row. For
            their medical procedures...Now:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.

A Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road.

ANGLE INT. THE CRUISER. A road sign reads "Just Two Miles To
'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel".

ANGLE EXT. THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station,
restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down
the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant,
carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen
by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts
to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from
the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A
man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the
roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who
returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant.

The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac,
parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again,
and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire
bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in
the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that
the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at
him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at
the Trooper, who falls.

The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and
currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind.
The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop
it up and into his jacket.

ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands
around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys
from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone
gazing at him.

ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and
ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He
is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously.

                                                            63.


We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire.

ANGLE on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he
took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the
highway.

LOW ANGLE, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast,
the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails,
corrects, and disappears in the distance.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Scott driving steals a look back at
Assani, in the back seat, whimpering.

                       SCOTT
            Shut up.

The Police Radio chatters: "Two Twelve Sierra, come
back...Two Twelve Sierra, come back, we have your request
for Code Seven...please come back with your Twenty."

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            Yeah, two twelve sierra took all
            the 20 he's gonna take...Oh, man,
            you left him there...

ANGLE on Scott driving. He looks behind him.

ANGLE, POV. In the rearview mirror. A dust cloud settling
over the deserted highway.

ANGLE INT. THE OWL. Various techies, in the kitchen,
monitoring the broadcast of the microphone in the Police Car,
Anton among them. The Trooper comes in, taking off his
bullet-proof vest, and sits to listen, where we find Miller
and his Agents. The 'Restaurant Owner', who we now see is
Anton, takes off his jacket and his bullet-proof vest and
picks a slug, fired by Scott, out of the center of the vest.

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT (V.O.)
            ...yeah. You marked him Paid in
            Full...

                      ASSANI (V.O.)
            ...you got to pull over, you got
            to stop...I'm bleeding.

ANGLE INT. THE POLICE CAR.

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            Yeah, he done ate from the tree
            of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve.

                      ASSANI
            ...help me...

                                                             64.


                       SCOTT
            Shut up.

ANGLE, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. The car comes to a panic stop,
fifty yards beyond a turnoff onto a dirt road. The car is
put in gear, backs up, and takes the road.

EXT. FARM ROAD. DAY.

The car comes quickly up a small farm road, we see a run-
down barn, and a farmhouse, washing on the line. Scott pulls
the car into the barn, next to an old pick-up truck. He gets
out of the car, we hear Assani in the backseat calling to him.

ANGLE, Scott, as he turns to Assani, who is pressing a
blood-soaked shirt to his neck. Calling "Help me".

Scott opens the back door of the Cruiser, and the Heavyset
Man gets out, and offers his manacled hands for release.
Scott motions to Assani.

                      SCOTT
            ...drag him out...
                 (the man does so. Scott
                 motions for them to be quiet)
            ...got some business to do...

He takes his pistol and walks toward the farmhouse.

HOLD on Assani, and the other Convict, Assani is holding a
rag to his bleeding neck.

                      ASSANI
            ...help me...

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            ...yeah, I heard yah...

ANGLE, on Scott, as he walks past a clothesline heavy with
drying clothes, he is seen to go into the house. We hear a
woman's scream, and then two shots are fired.

ANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As Scott is found at a table in the
kitchen next to which are various foodstuffs laid out.
Inside the house we see a female techie, at a table by the
wall, various communications gear in front of her. Scott
begins loading up his pockets with food. The techie hands
Scott a slate on which is written, in large block letters,
"The helo is standing by, will assault in support when you
have found the girl. On your command." Scott gestures for
the slate, and writes on it, and hands it back. Scott nods,
and walks out of the house.

                                                             65.


ANGLE INSERT. The slate, on which we see Scott has written
"Keep Your Distance!"

ANGLE, on Scott, as he walks back through the yard, pulling
clothes off the line.

ANGLE INT. THE BARN. The two convicts, as Scott enters, and
begins changing out of his clothes, and into the clothes he
found on the line.

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            Yeah, Baby. Pass some my way...

                      SCOTT
            Sorry, my man...traveling light...

He turns to the Heavyset Man, and fires his revolver at him
twice. The man falls, dead. Scott turns his revolver at
Assani, who begins to scream.

                      ASSANI
            Don't shoot me, don't shoot me,
            I have what you want. I HAVE
            WHAT YOU WANT. I CAN GET US OUT
            OF THE COUNTRY TONIGHT. TONIGHT.
            NO PASSPORT. FLY OUT.
            TONIGHT...OH GOD, DON'T SHOOT ME!
            I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER. LOOK AT ME:
            AM I LYING TO YOU? A SEA PLANE.
            TONIGHT. HELP ME. I SWEAR TO YOU.

                      SCOTT
            Why in the world would I believe
            a lying convict like you...

                      ASSANI
            Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe
            me...I see it...you do. I can
            get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO
            YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat
            you like a brother...I...

Scott advances on him.

                      SCOTT
            My brother used to beat me
                 (he raises the cop's
                 service revolver and
                 cocks the hammer)
            Nice guess, though.

                         ASSANI
            OH GOD NO!

                                                          66.


Scott pulls the trigger, which falls on an empty chamber.
Assani whimpers, as Scott goes into the Cruiser, comes out
with a box of shells, clears the empties from the cop's gun,
and begins loading it.

                      ASSANI
            No, no. Listen to
            me...listen...make one call. One
            call - go in the house. Make One
            Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation
            Company. Tell...tell them...tell
            them the word I say, and they
            will say: THE PLANE WILL MEET
            YOU AT...
                 (Scott hesitates for a
                 moment, and Assani
                 attempts to capitalize
                 on it)
            Yes. Yes...

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. DAY.

Scott is driving. The dash is littered with empty coffeecups,
cigarette packs. He turns.

ANGLE HIS POV. Assani, sitting in the shotgun seat, a map in
his lap, looking at him.

                      SCOTT
            You a fag my friend?

                      ASSANI
            No.
                 (pause)
            I am not.

                      SCOTT
            Then why the hell you looking at me?

                      ASSANI
            I was thinking...how fucking
            surprised you're going to be.
                 (pause)
            Because, Baby, you just did that
            fucken good turn, going to Make
            You Rich, Fat, and Happy...

                      SCOTT
            ...just get me on that plane.

                      ASSANI
            Didn't they tell you...?

                                                      67.


                      SCOTT
            All I heard's a voice on the
            phone...

Assani grins, as if to say, "Just Wait".

                      ASSANI
            ...you like girls...?

                      SCOTT
            Better question, where you've
            been so long, do you like girls?

Scott grins, and Assani shares the moment with him.

                      ASSANI
            We have. You will have...the
            most beautiful...

                      SCOTT
            ...most beautiful women, eh?

                      ASSANI
            Not women, Baby. Girls. You got
            to trust me, I'm the Doctor
            here...All young. All blonde...

                      SCOTT
            And this all takes place Where...?

                      ASSANI
            In Dubai. In Yemen...

                      SCOTT
            Well, that's a long way from
            Tiperrary, pal...

                      ASSANI
            ...what do you have here...?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to
            live in a fucken tent.
                 (Assani laughs)


                      ASSANI
            If you think you can imagine
            luxury...I am here to tell you,
            my friend...
                 (he smiles broadly)

                                                          68.


                      SCOTT
            Well, may it Just Be So...

                      ASSANI
            When we get to Maskala...

                      SCOTT
            And, now, what's Maskala...?

                      ASSANI
            ...when we get to Dubai, better...

                      SCOTT
            What's Maskala...?

                      ASSANI
            ...that's where we clean them up.
            We ship them Rough, we make them
            Smooth, and everybody's happy.

                      SCOTT
            Well, then, you're a
            philosopher...huh...? How 'bout
            making me happy tonight...

                      ASSANI
            If there's a girl, in the
            pipeline, tonight, you shall
            have her, what do you say to that?

                      SCOTT
            ...I say you're a stone cold
            whoremaster...

Assani joins with him in the joke, nodding his assent.

                      ASSANI
            No, no baby. Take it to the    bank.
            The Arabs, Man. All the oil    -
            all the money in the world.    What
            can't they have? Booze and    Pussy.
            How do they get it...?

                      SCOTT
            You the candy man? Is that it?

Assani begins to swoon. He puts his hand to his neck, and it
comes away covered in blood, where it was cut by the glass
fragment.

                      SCOTT
            Ah. Hell...

                                                          69.


                      ASSANI
            Yeah, no. I'm bleeding bad here,
            friend...

                      SCOTT
                 (he looks over)
            Yeah, we just, we got to get
            some...yeah, you need, all we
            need, some tailoring tools.

ANGLE, Sedan. Holding Anton and several agents, listening to
the broadcast from Scott's car.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a
            drugstore, get us some morphine,
            some...

ANGLE EXT. ANTON'S CAR. As it increases speed.

ANGLE INT. SCOTT'S CAR. As he tries to staunch the fellow.
Scott steers with one hand. And turns off the highway at an
exit, showing two miles to a town.

INT. SMALL TOWN PHARMACY. DAY.

Scott, dressed in the farm clothes that he took off of the
line. Scott is buying supplies. On the counter we see
bandages, hydrogen peroxide, etc. Behind the counter we see
a newscast, showing a picture of Laura Newton, in long
blonde hair, and a woman is doing a talking-head about fashion.

                      TV WOMAN
            ...America's Number One Redhead,
            "She Sets the Style, She Brings
            a Smile", she's Betty co-ed, in
            College, and she's off for what
            her father's office says is an
            "extended sailing weekend".
                 (the screen shows a sailboat)
            With "person or persons
            unknown"...yo ho, yo Ho...she
            "old" enough for that, our
            "Little Red Riding-Hood", Cathy...?

Scott ignores the screen.

ANGLE EXT. THE STORE. In back, Assani is sitting in the
pickup, a woman driving another beat-up pickup pulls into
the lot, there is a shotgun in the rack by the rear window.
Assani crouches lower, to prevent being seen.

ANGLE INT. THE STORE. As Scott is checking out. A policeman
enters from the police car. We see it is Anton.

                                                             70.


ANGLE. On Scott, as he moves to the back of the store, to
meet Anton. Scott looks inquisitively at him.

                      ANTON
                 (whispers)
            ...the helo just went down...

                      SCOTT
            ...don't whisper to me, Baby, it
            draws heat. What helo?

                      ANTON
            ...the assault helicopter. You've
            got no backup, at the house.
                 (beat. Scott nods)
            You'll be in there, alone, the
            first few minutes...

                      SCOTT
            Well, there you go, then.

                      ANTON
            You said "Never go in without an
            overwatch".

                      SCOTT
            That's all fine, lad, "But this
            is the fleet".

                       ANTON
            You know you deliver him in the
            door, you know they're going to
            waste you.

                      SCOTT
            ...gimme whatever nine mil you've
            got...

Anton takes out the magazines in the pouches on his belt.
And starts to strip off the rounds.

                      SCOTT
            ...just gimme the mags...
                 (Anton does so)
            ...gimme your piece.

Anton takes the pistol from his belt. Scott checks it, and
puts it in the small of his back.

ANGLE EXT. THE STORE. Assani, in the pickup, sees through a
small window in the store.

ANGLE on Anton and Scott. Scott is walking away from him,
and Anton puts a hand on him, and turns him back.

                                                             71.


ANGLE INT. THE STORE. Anton gestures Scott to wait a moment.
Scott waves, it is not necessary. He goes to the counter,
and picks up the medical supplies. He starts toward the back
door. He calls back, over his shoulder

                      SCOTT
            Thank you...

ANGLE on Anton, as we see something occur to him. He turns
to the other officer with him, and asks a question, and we
see the other officer hand Anton several magazines of
ammunition.

ANGLE on Scott, as he is coming out of the back door.

ANGLE on Anton, as he follows him.

                      ANTON
                 (calling)
            Mister...mister: you forgot your
            change...

ANGLE on Scott, as he turns back. We see Anton bringing the
ammunition.

ANGLE on Assani, weak, holding the shotgun, as he supports
himself along the wall, he peers around the corner, at Anton
and Scott.

                      ANTON
                 (sotto)
            ...you better take care of
            yourself, because...

ANGLE, on Assani, who comes around the corner, and fires the
shotgun at Anton, who falls. Scott screams "No".

ANGLE, on Scott, who drops the packages, and turns to Assani,
who is jacking another round into the chamber of the shotgun.
Scott draws and fires at him several times.

ANGLE on Scott, who kicks away the shotgun, and turns back
to Anton, who is crawling on his back, out of the line of
fire...

                      ANTON
            A...I'm alright...I'm alright...

ANGLE, on Scott, turning to look at Anton. And, then, back
at the obviously dead Assani.

INT. SMALL TOWN HOSPITAL. DAY.

In a waiting room. Scott, who looks up, as Miller enters.

                                                            72.


                      MILLER
            Your partner's going to be alright.

                      SCOTT
            I do not look at the downed man,
            Sir...

                      MILLER
            Yeah, well...

Miller nods, and starts to walk away.

                         SCOTT
            ...Sir...?

Miller turns back, understanding Scott's request.

                      MILLER
                 (sits, acceding to
                 Scott's request)
            ...Air Force Assault is airborne,
            five minutes out.
                 (pause, Scott shakes
                 his head sadly)
            Standing down's a bitch.

                       SCOTT
            I stand down when the girl's
            back, sir.

                      MILLER
            They'll get her out, if she's in
            there...
                 (pause, as he looks at Scott)
            You did your part, what the fuck
            do you want, a Citation?

Out of the window we see a   medical helicopter. Its rotors
just starting to turn. We   see two white-coated medical types,
carrying bags, run toward   the medical copter. An Aide comes
in, and gestures to Miller   that the copter is ready to go.

                         AIDE
            ...sir...

Miller turns to leave. Scott stands wearily.

                      MILLER
            Where are you going.

                      SCOTT
            On the dustoff.

                                                             73.


                         MILLER
            Forget it.

                      SCOTT
            Sir...? Sir...?

                      MILLER
            There's no room.

                      SCOTT
            I'm pleading with you, sir...

                      MILLER
            Let him hear the assault on the
            Net...

                      SCOTT
            I want to see the girl.

Miller shakes his head - at the door, turns back for one
last word to Scott. And then he stops.

ANGLE. HIS POV. The television, in the next room, playing a
news program. Scott looks inquiringly at Miller, who is
transfixed by the television.

ANGLE the television. A "Breaking News" story. We see an
overturned sailboat, and the talking head narrating: "...the
tragic, the stunning...the...Jim, I don't know what to
say..." The woman's co-anchor, obviously very shaken, takes
up the story, and we see live footage of an overturned
sailboat being towed into a harbor, then inserts of "Our
Redhead" Laura Newton, and, after a moment, the Professor.

                      JIM (TALKING HEAD NEWSCASTER)
            The death, just reported, the
            death of Laura Newton. The... the...

ANGLE, on the TV. On two bodies being taken from the water
by medical technicians.

ANGLE, the woman, as a shot of the political man we saw
earlier in the newspaper, comes on the screen.

                      TALKING HEAD WOMAN
            ...her father, on the eve of the
            campaign...
                 (we switch to a video
                 shot of this man,
                 waving off reporters)
            Jim, can there be any doubt...

                                                            74.


                      JIM
            Tracey, the Secret Service, for
            obvious reasons, their records,
            the DNA, fingerprints... the...
            and, she had just been in the
            water a scant, less than four
            hours, the...apparently the boat
            swamped... she -

                      TRACEY
            She was sailing with...?

                      JIM
            With her professor, Professor...?
                 (the video shows the Professor)


ANGLE, on Tracey, as she is overcome, and tries to steady
herself.

ANGLE, on Miller, and the Troopers in the room. Miller looks
away from the screen, to Scott.

                      TRACEY
            ...a Tragedy, such as this.

                      JIM
            ...particularly. Particularly,
            Tracey, coming, right at the
            start of his Campaign...

An insert of Laura's father, his sportcoat slung over his
shoulder, comes onto the screen.

                      TRACEY
            Will he delay the start of the
            Campaign?

ANGLE. On Scott. As he is found, standing, near the
television. Off to the side, behind him, we see Miller,
intently, on the phone, listening.

                      JIM
            ...his grief...

                      TRACEY
            ...he was very close to his
            daughter, wasn't he?

                                                            75.


                      JIM
            Well, indeed, he saw her, the
            day...that would be, the day
            before last. He was in Boston
            for the Strategy Meeting, and
            saw her then...

                      TRACEY
                 (sadly)
            ...and that would be the Last
            time...that...

ANGLE. On Scott. As he is looking at the television, he
shakes his head minutely, as if in a dialogue with himself.
He walks back to the interrogation room.

Scott sits heavily. Miller walks in and sits next to him.

                      MILLER
            Her boyfriend called her a slut.
            She went off to prove it. Her
            and the Professor. Coked up,
            boat capsized...Both bodies
            washed up naked. Coast Guard
            dressed 'em up...full of Ecstasy...

                      SCOTT
            ...he killed her...

                      MILLER
                 (shrugs, meaning "who knows")
            He was fucking her, they're
            stoned...the boat capsized...

Miller looks down at the artifacts.

                      MILLER
                 (almost to himself)
            ...so much death.

                      SCOTT
                 (philosophically, as
                 if summing the whole
                 thing up)
            ...rock crushes scissors...

We see Miller leave, as Scott turns away, and lights a
cigarette. Miller turns back.

                      MILLER
            I'm sorry about your man.

                                                           76.


                      SCOTT
            He isn't my man, Sir. He's a
            trainee.

Beat. Miller leaves the room. Scott hangs his head with
weariness.

INT. GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT PLANE. NIGHT.

Anton, in bandages, in a bunk in the transport plane. Scott,
asleep, in a chair near him.

ANGLE on Anton, as he comes awake.

                      ANTON
            ...what time is it?

                      SCOTT
            What do you care...?
                 (pause. We see that
                 Anton is having
                 difficulty formulating
                 his thoughts)


                      ANTON
            I fucked up.

                      SCOTT
            ...in what way was that?

                      ANTON
                 (groggily, as he tries
                 to move, to draw closer
                 to Scott)
            ...but I was trying to help.
                 (Scott reacts to
                 Anton's pain.)


                      SCOTT
            What? Do you want some more Dope?
            Whaddaya want, a Dr. Pepper...?

Scott takes a pill vial from Anton's jacket. Takes out a
pill, and administers it to him.

                      ANTON
            ...but I was trying to help.

                                                77.


                      SCOTT
            ...yeah, well, that's when people
            generally do fuck up. Wait for
            that to kick in.
                 (Anton starts to lay
                 back, and then, as if
                 he is remembering
                 something, he draws
                 closer to Scott again.)
            You're gonna take that fight to
            bed for a while. You don't got
            to do it all now.

Anton gestures Scott to draw close.

                      ANTON
                 (sotto)
            I saw the sign.

ANGLE XCU on Scott as he turns away.

                      SCOTT
            ...uh huh...

Scott turns away.

                       ANTON
                 (drawing him back, as
                 if saying LISTEN:)
            I saw the sign...at the Cape. In
            the House.

                      SCOTT
            You saw-the-sign. What sign?

                      ANTON
            ...when I dropped the guy. The
            girl's Picasso sign...
                 (he draws the sign in
                 the condensation on
                 the plane's window)
            She was there. At the Cape. The
            girl was there.

                      SCOTT
            The girl wasn't there. She was
            on a boat. She fell off the boat.
            She's dead.
                 (pause)
            You did what you could. You did
            what you were trained to do.
                 (pause)
            You did what you could.

                                                             78.


                      ANTON
            ...I saw the sign...

                      SCOTT
                 (turning away)
            ...then you are Truly Blessed.

INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.

We see the Dojo, training room. Several exhausted young men
in sweat stained fatigues watch a lecturer, with a knife in
his hand, demonstrating a manoeuvre with a trainee.

Beyond, on the wall, we see the sign. "These are the
precincts of pain. A Godess lives here. Her name is Victory."

Beyond, through the open doors, we see Scott's Mustang
driven up to a nearby building. A young man gets out.

ANGLE, INT. THE BUILDING. Scott, rested, clean, shaved,
drinking a cup of coffee. Sitting across a desk from an
Interrogator, who has several notes in front of him.

                      INTERROGATOR
            ...from the house, a house, a
            holding facility, a compound?
            called Maskala. The girls are
            taken from Maskala, to the
            ...Royale Hotel, in Dubai.
                 (he closes the notes,
                 as if completing his presentation)
            As time passes, you may remember
            other aspects of...well,
                 (the Interrogator stands)
            You've heard this speech before...

He extends his hand to Scott. Scott looks inquisitively at
him, then pauses, then stands.

ANGLE EXT. THIS BUILDING. Scott exiting, as Blane comes out
of his office. They walk through the compound. And to the
camera, toward the Mustang.

                      SCOTT
            ...would be most grateful, sir,
            to be included on the mission.
            "At Such Time..."
                 (pause)


                      BLANE
            ...on a mission to Dubai.

                                                             79.


                      SCOTT
            Is it in contemplation, sir...?
                 (pause)


ANGLE, on Blane, who looks at him to say "you know better
than to ask."

                      SCOTT
            Yes, sir.
                 (pause)
            If and When, Sir...

                      BLANE
            You need a rest, Bobby.
                 (pause. as he extends
                 his hand)
            Thank you, Bobby...

Scott puts down the small yellow duffle he carries, next to
his Mustang. The young man who drove it in stands by, as
Blane and Scott shake hands. Scott looks at the training
facility.

ANGLE HIS POV. The lecturer, executing unarmed combat moves
against a trainee, who holds a knife. The lecturer puts the
trainee on his back.

Scott starts to walk toward this facility. He stands outside,
by an open double-door, next to a water cooler, and draws
himself a cup of water, which he drinks. As he watches the
lesson.

He turns back, as he sees the young man who drove in the
Mustang pick up the yellow duffle, to put it into the car.

                      SCOTT
            ...please don't touch that.
                 (Scott picks up the
                 duffle and puts the
                 strap over his shoulder)


ANGLE, Scott's POV, as he turns. We see the young female
sergeant, Jackie Black, in the BG, walking across the area.

Scott nods at her. She nods back. Scott starts to get into
his car, and then turns back.

ANGLE. SCOTT'S POV as the trainee on the mat gets up, and
the lecturer gestures at the knife he has dropped on the mat.

                      LECTURER
            ...pick it up.

                                                          80.


The trainee picks up the knife. The lecturer shakes his head.

                      LECTURER
            What are you studying here...?
            I'm talking to you, son... What
            are you studying?

                      TRAINEE
            Sir, this Candidate is studying
            knife fighting.

The lecturer pauses, looking down at the ground. Beat.

                      LECTURER
            Hold your ground, son.

The Trainee goes into a knife fighting stance.

                      LECTURER
                 (pointing behind him)
            ...you, and your friend...

The Trainee lets his attention drift for a second, in the
direction the Lecturer has pointed. And the Lecturer screams,
steps in, disarms the Trainee, throwing him to the mat. As
the Trainee picks himself up the Lecturer turns to the class.

                      LECTURER
            There are two ways to fight, you
            can fight fair, or you can fight
            to win.

The Trainee puts his hand to his head, and discovers he is
bleeding. The Lecturer nods his permission, and the Trainee
walks to a water cooler, next to which Scott is standing.
Scott looks at the shamed Trainee.

                      SCOTT
            Don't you study knife fighting,
            son. You Learn to Kill. And then,
            f'you meet some other fellow,
            studied knife fighting, you send
            him to hell.

ANGLE, on the Lecturer, who calls another Trainee up.

                        LECTURER
            Next man:

A Trainee stands.

                      LECTURER
            Now: I want to see some evil intent.

                                                            81.


The Lecturer glances at Scott, and makes a small "have a
drink" gesture. The Lecturer nods back "yes". Scott walks
toward his car.

EXT. "CONSTRUCTION GATE". DAY.

The man inside the "construction booth" raises the barrier,
and looks at Scott, who drives through.

INT. ROADSIDE TRUCKERS BAR. NIGHT.

The Lecturer (Grace) and Scott, in a booth drinking.

Pause.

                      GRACE
            Hey, fuck it, Huh...?

                      SCOTT
            I've always thought so.

Scott gestures for another round to the bartender. Who is
serving some rough trucker types, two of whom are at the bar
with a couple of very attractive young women. One is a
stunning redhead, who looks back at Scott.

                      GRACE
            How'd the puppy like it out there?
            He piss in the punchbowl?

                      SCOTT
            He did okay.

                      GRACE
            I heard he caught poison ivy.

                      SCOTT
            He did okay. Why? You goin' out?

                      GRACE
            What?

                      SCOTT
            You recruiting?

                      GRACE
            Why would I be recruiting?

                      SCOTT
            You speak Arabic, huh...?

                      GRACE
            That's what the Arabs tell me.

                                                          82.


                      SCOTT
            You, reason I ask: you going in
            the Sandbox...?

                      GRACE
            Ain't you overdue for some Down
            Time?

                      SCOTT
            I'm just saying:

Scott is distracted. He is watching the talking heads, on
the bar TV talking about Laura Newton. We see the photos of
her in high school, with her father in some African country,
et cetera.

ANGLE. On Grace, watching Scott. Who shakes his head very sadly.

                      GRACE
            Yeah. You Marines are a weepy
            bunch of motherfuckers.
                 (Scott nods minutely
                 in acknowledgement.
                 And returns to watching
                 the television)
            ...you get a chance to bowl in
            that tournament...?

ANGLE on Scott. Caught in the image of Laura Newton, on the
television.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            ...beautiful girl...

ANGLE on the truckers, near the television, looking at Scott.
One comes over to him.

                      TRUCKER
            ...you say something, Mister...?

                      SCOTT
            No, I was looking at the
            television.
                 (pause)
            I was talking to the television.
                 (he turns to look at
                 the girl)
            That girl's too good-looking for
            you anyway. What are you "rich"?
            What do you, "own" something?
                      (MORE)

                                                           83.


                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
                 (pause)
            Or are you "funny" or
            something...?
                 (pause. Hold for a
                 beat, on the confused
                 face of the Trucker)
            Siddown. Lemme buy you a drink.

INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM. DAWN.

A sound of a truck, coming down the highway.

ANGLE, on the doorknob of the hotel room. We see several
quarters stacked. As the truck sound comes closer, the
quarters start to rumble, and fall off the doorknob.

ANGLE, on the floor, a glass ashtray. The quarters fall into
the ashtray.

ANGLE, Scott, in bed, naked, comes awake, as the quarters
hit the ashtray. He has a pistol in hand, and awakes with a
start, screaming. He surveys the motel room, taking in his
new surroundings. Beat. Next to him, the redhead from the
bar, also naked, comes awake, frightened, looking at Scott.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he surveys the hotel room.

ANGLE HIS POV. On a dresser, a cheap imitation pewter bowl,
an orange and a banana in it, on the table next to it, his
switchblade, open, and the remains of a peeled apple. He
looks at the knife, and at the girl.

                      SCOTT
            You peel the apple?

She nods, not sure how to take Scott.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he starts to come
                 down from the
                 adrenaline rush)
            ...well. You should wipe off the
            blade.
                      (MORE)

                                                            84.


                         SCOTT (CONT'D)
                   (pause. Scott does so,
                   cleaning the blade on
                   a napkin)
            Or   else...
                   (as if explaining the
                   simplest and most
                   perfect axiom of the universe)
            Or   else, it "rusts"...
                   (a pause. He smiles at
                   her. Pause)
            D'I   scare you...?
                   (he closes the blade
                   and sits on the bed,
                   shaking his head to
                   clear it)
            I'm   sorry if I frightened you.
                   (pause)


EXT. SMALL TOWN RURAL MAIN STREET. DAY.

A three-store town, a couple of pick-up trucks parked in
front of the country store. A large double log truck goes
through the town. The girl looks for some topic of
conversation, to bridge the awkward moment.

                      GIRL
            ...it's an odd knife.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah. I got it from a Russian
            fellow.

                      GIRL
            Was it a gift...?

                      SCOTT
            No. As I remember, he seemed
            rather reluctant to part with it.
                 (pause)
            It's just a knife.

EXT. SMALL RURAL VILLAGE. MAIN STREET. DAY.

A three store town. A couple of pickup trucks parked in
front of the country store. Scott's Mustang parked next to
them. A large, filled, double-length log truck speeds
through the village. Scott, in his lumber jacket, is
assembling various maintenance items on the checkout counter.
A large paintbrush, several boxes of nails, a gallon of
paint. The Proprietor, a good-natured fellow in his fifties,
comes up to the counter to check Scott out.

                                                             85.


                      PROPRIETOR
            How you been, John...?

                      SCOTT
            ...workin hard...

                      PROPRIETOR
            ...bet you have...

                      SCOTT
            How you, Billy...?

Proprietor pours Scott a cup of coffee from the pot on the
back counter. He mixes in sugar and cream. Billy nods in
response to Scott's question.

                      PROPRIETOR
            ...one gallon goin to do it...?

                      SCOTT
                 (pointing at him accusingly)
            ...you been lookin' at my house...?

                      PROPRIETOR
            Nope, just trine a sell you some
            paint...
                 (as he puts the cup
                 down in front of Scott.
                 Joking)
            ...but, now you mention it...

ANGLE, On Billy, as he moves to a new customer, a farmer,
who comes in, and nods at Scott.

                         NEW FARMER
            ...John...

                      SCOTT
            Mr. Reese, how are you...?
                 (Billy goes to take
                 care of the new
                 customer, and turns
                 back to deal with Scott,
                 who is waiting to ask
                 a question)
            That new saw blade come in?

                      BILLY
                 (as if just remembering)
            No, John. It did not. I beg your
            pardon. I know that's your
            baby...I'm gone call them up and
            get Right On That.

                                                             86.


ANGLE on Scott, who sees something out the window, and moves
toward the front of the store.

                      BILLY
                 (as an afterthought)
            ...'spected you back a few days
            ago...

                      SCOTT
                 (looking out the window,
                 absently)
            I took the Long Way Home.

ANGLE Scott, who is looking, over his coffee, at something
on the street. And we see, his POV, a very city rent-a-car
which is now across the street. We see a man getting out of
the car.

EXT. GAS STATION. COUNTRY VILLAGE. DAY.

We see the back of a man, next to the rental car, which is
next to the Mustang. He turns, and we see that it is Anton,
his arm in a slig, his face creased by pellet scars.

ANGLE, his POV. Looking at Scott, who has just snuck up
behind him.

                       SCOTT
            Could I see your Right Hand,
            please...?

                      ANTON
            There's nothing in my right hand.

                      SCOTT
            Could I see it, please...?

Anton holds up his right hand. Scott relaxes, and comes
forward. Anton gestures, meaning, "what was that about"?
Scott takes Anton's right hand, by the wrist, and turns it
over. He explains:

                      SCOTT
            You put your wedding ring back on.

                       ANTON
                 (not understanding the
                 import of the question)
            ...yes...?

                                                             87.


                      SCOTT
            Then I have to guess you're not
            "on assignment".
                 (pause)
            You're in the wrong place, baby.
                 (pause)
            How did you find me...?

Anton gestures at the "Oilchange" sticker on the Mustang's
windshield.

ANGLE from INT. The Car. We see the sticker reading "Mike's
Service Station, Bradford, PA". And beyond it, the actual
old, tin sign of the garage, reading "Mike's Service Station".

ANGLE, on Scott and Anton.

                      SCOTT
            Well, I guess I'm not as smart
            as I thought I was.
                 (pause)


                      ANTON
            I need to talk to you.

A beat. Scott shakes his head, as if in a sad comment to
himself. He sighs.

EXT. RURAL STREET. DAY.

Anton and Scott walking down the street.

                      ANTON
            I saw the sign.

                      SCOTT
            "You saw the sign". You were up
            for a week, you coulda seen Jack
            Ruby, you don't know what you
            saw...your first-time-out.

                      ANTON
            I saw the sign.

                      SCOTT
            ...then, you tell me: you saw
            the sign, how is it, they found
            the girl, the DNA...why would
            they do that...? Her father? Her
            father would do that to her?

                      ANTON
            ...maybe he doesn't know...

                                                   88.


                      SCOTT
            Well. You're living in a
            fairyland of your Own Devising.
            You're seeing snakes.
                 (pause)


                      ANTON
            Who's going to Dubai...?
                 (pause. Scott hesitates)
            They've got a white slave ring,
            in Dubai, with American girls
            there - are they going in?
                 (pause)
            Are they sending you in...?
                 (pause)
            Ask them...
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            You Got. To Leave it for your
            Betters.

                        ANTON
            Ask them.

                      SCOTT
            Why would you want to know?
                 (pause)
            Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go
            through the door. WE don't ask
            why. That's not a COST, it's a
            Benefit. Because we Got to Travel
            Light. You wanna lose sleep over
            it, get over it, or get out.
                 (hold. pause)
            You wanted to go Through the
            Looking Glass. How was it? Was
            it more fun than Miniature Golf...?

                      ANTON
            I want a favor.

                      SCOTT
            Why would I do you a favor?

Two old ladies come down the small main street.

                      OLD LADY
            Morning, John, who's your friend...?

                      SCOTT
            Fella wants to buy my car.

                                                 89.


The old ladies walk on. Pause.

                      ANTON
            I saved your life.

                      SCOTT
            Well what were they paying you
            for...?

                      ANTON
            Bobby, I saw the Sign...

                      SCOTT
            My name ain't Bobby.
                 (pause)


                      ANTON
            I saw the sign.
                 (he draws the Picasso
                 sign in the dust on
                 the window of the
                 country store)
            I Saw it. At the beach house.
                 (pause)
            I'm going back.

                      SCOTT
            Back?

                      ANTON
            To the beach house.

                      SCOTT
            They took it apart with a
            tweezers.
                 (Anton shakes his head)


                      ANTON
            She was there. The Girl was There.
            I'm going back.
                 (pause)
            I want you to do something.

                      SCOTT
            What would that be?

                      ANTON
            The Secret Service Agent. Offed
            himself.

                      SCOTT
            ...he was off boffing his girl.

                                                          90.


                      ANTON
            He shot himself with a hide-out
            pistol.

                        SCOTT
            Yeah?

                      ANTON
            Who frisked the sonofabitch?
                 (pause)
            You ask them.

ANGLE, on Scott, obviously off-balanced by the question. Hold.

INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.

Stoddard, smoking a black cigar, and several "Bureau" types
in the office. Scott is sitting at a conference table, as is
Miller. Beat.

                      STODDARD
            Number one, the girl's dead.
            Number two, the hide-out gun the
            Agent shot with's registered in
            his 1020 for the past five years.
            The man who tossed him has been
            sacked. His name is none of your
            concern. Now: what the fuck are
            you doing here?

                      SCOTT
            Sir, I am not here to question...

                      STODDARD
            Well, then, what the fuck are
            you doing here...?

                      MILLER
            Sir, as he said, he is here to
            apprise you of a security leak...

                        SCOTT
            ...and...

Miller gestures to him to shut up.

                      MILLER
            To call your attention to what
            may be a problem in discipline
            with this...

                                                             91.


                      STODDARD
            Granted. Granted.
                 (he stands)
            Granted. Fine. Thank you.

                      SCOTT
            And. Sir...If I may...

                      STODDARD
            What is it?

                      SCOTT
            When the operation is staged in
            Dubai...

                      STODDARD
            What is this...?

                      MILLER
            He...

                      STODDARD
            ...what the fuck are you talking
            about?

                      SCOTT
            I am merely saying, when -

                      STODDARD
            Forget it. Walk away.

                      SCOTT
            I...

                      STODDARD
            Yeah...you're a pit bull. I said
            forget it. How do we contact Anton?

                      MILLER
            ...Anton...

                      STODDARD
            Your partner...He's gone to
            ground...

Scott shrugs, as if to say, "Is that the way you want it?"

                      MILLER
            Yes, sir...

                                                             92.


                      STODDARD
            And, wait, wait, wait, wait,
            what does this mean...?
                 (of Scott)
            When and if, any operation is
            staged which may require your
            talents, I give you my word...
                 (Scott shakes his head,
                 saying "I don't believe
                 a word of it")
            You impertinent motherfucker.
            What the fuck is with you, you've
            got on your "thinkingcap" all of
            a sudden...?

Stoddard gestures to an aide to call a number.

                      SCOTT
            I'd like to finish what I started.

                      STODDARD
            And I'm telling you to Stand
            Down. Where's the kid?
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Is there no operation in Dubai...?

Stoddard shakes his head in exasperation.

The Aide hands Stoddard the phone. Stoddard answers. Listens
for a moment, and then points at Scott.

EXT. GRAVESIDE. DAY.

A small photograph on an easel - it is an image of Gaines,
the dead Secret Serviceman.

ANGLE, a small funeral. A Marine Honor Guard in attendance.
Small suburban cemetery.

ANGLE on the Pastor.

                      PASTOR
            ...in the Service. In the Service
            of his Country. No less than had
            he died in Combat. George Gaines,
            a man who gave his life to
            service, to protecting those who...

ANGLE, an unmarked sedan. Scott, and a Driver. Looking on.

                                                            93.


                      DRIVER
            ...sucker did the Dutch.

                      SCOTT
            I heard it was a training accident.

                      DRIVER
            Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn't you
            know?

                      SCOTT
            I've been out of town.

                      DRIVER
            Punched out early, off with the
            girlfriend, his Principal wanders
            off, winds up dead: hari-kari...

ANGLE, on Scott, as he sees something. Scott takes a book of
matches and starts to light a cigarette.

                      DRIVER
            ...rather you didn't smoke in here.

Scott gets out of the car.

ANGLE, on Scott, who takes out the Anton "Rogers Rangers"
card. He motions the driver to pass him a phone and Scott
looks at the number on the card and dials.

Beyond him we see, just at the limits of the gravesite.
Holding himself apart. A young man in a raincoat. The young
man turns at the sound of a limo driving up.

ANGLE Scott, looking at the limo. Out of the limo, which
stops near the grave, we see Burch emerge. There is a
susurrus among the crowd, which, visibly, straightens a bit,
at the honor of Burch's presence. We see Burch walk to the
gravesite, and have a word with the widow. Burch puts his
hands on her shoulders and comforts her.

ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man in the raincoat. We hear
rifle fire, and Scott flinches.

ANGLE his POV. The Marine Honor Guard, rendering a salute.
We see a Marine bear the flag to Burch, who presents it to
the widow. He shakes several hands, and then moves off, back
to the limousine. He beckons Scott over to him.

ANGLE, Scott and Burch, walking through the cemetery. Burch
shakes his head. He hands Scott the program from the funeral,
and reluctantly begins.

                                                94.


                      BURCH
            I put myself in your hands.
            Didn't I...?

                      SCOTT
            I do not follow you, sir.

                      BURCH
            I reached out to you.
                 (pause)
            I put my life into your hands. I
            entered into a conspiracy with
            you. To commit Murder. Because
            it needed to be done.
                 (pause)
            I trusted you with my life.

                      SCOTT
            I would never betray you, sir.

                      BURCH
                 (waving his assurances away)
            I trusted you with my life. And
            yet you cannot trust me.
                 (pause)
            There are things you have not
            been told. That's right.
                 (pause)
            And now you're all out-of-line,
            "Play me or trade me..."
                 (pause)


ANGLE, on the two.

                      BURCH
                 (almost as if against
                 his better nature)
            There is an Arab World. To
            penetrate it makes trying to
            join the Mafia look like a walk
            in the park. How would you do it,
            Scott?
                 (pause)
            We're dying. We're at war. And
            we have no intelligence. How
            Would you do it? How would you
            infiltrate their clan structure?
            Where is the interface?
                 (pause)
            It's at the whorehouse. That's
            where they go to get frisky, and
            that's where we listen to them.
                      (MORE)

                                                          95.


                      BURCH (CONT'D)
            For the few, priceless hints
            that we get from that fucking
            sandpile.
                 (pause)
            Had the girl been there, we would
            have moved heaven and earth -
            you know we would, and, we would
            have got her out. She was not
            there. She got drugged up and
            fell off a boat, and drowned.
            She's dead.
                 (of the funeral)
            That man,
                 (Burch gestures at the
                 photograph-on-the-
                 easel, of George Gaines,
                 the Secret Service man,
                 which stands by the
                 head of the grave)
            That man a sworn office of the
            Secret Service, went to get laid,
            and she died. And you are risking
            the lives of men and women in
            the field, because you won't
            take orders. How are you better
            than him? Yes. You had best look
            sheepish. What the fuck have you
            got to say?

                      SCOTT
            No excuse, sir.

                      BURCH
            You're goddam right.
                 (pause)
            Now: where's this new kid who
            got you all bothered. Where's
            your partner?

                      SCOTT
            ...I'll call him off.

                      BURCH
            The fuck you will. You've got
            nothing to say to him. He's gone
            to the ground. Where is he...?

ANGLE. Over the Honor Guard, packing up, we see Scott hand a
scrap of paper to Burch, who makes one or two more points,
to which Scott nods, submissively. Burch walks off. Camera
follows the Honor Guard, down the path, toward Scott, who,
passing, nods at them.

                                                             96.


HOLD on Scott. As he watches the widow, at the gravesite,
being walked away to a limo by the pastor. He feels someone
behind him and turns.

ANGLE, SCOTT'S POV. A man in a raincoat, standing furtively,
half-hidden by a tree, some distance off from the funeral,
weeping. He holds a program for the funeral.

ANGLE on the man in the raincoat, the funeral beyond him. He
is obviously distraught, a rather slight young man in his
thirties. He looks at Scott for a moment, and then turns away.

ANGLE. On Scott. As he turns back to watching the end of the
funeral. As the gravediggers begin their work. He sighs. And
moves to a bench and sits. Looking at the gravediggers.

DISSOLVE.

EXT. DUSK. GRAVEYARD.

Scott, still sitting on the bench. The gravediggers,
finishing their work, begin to walk off, joking with one
another. Scott stands, and turns, about to start out of the
cemetery. He stops for a moment.

ANGLE, HIS POV. The man in the raincoat, who is standing
where last seen, looking at the burial. Walks toward the
mound of earth, pauses for a moment, and then walks off.

EXT. BUS STOP. DESERTED, SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA, ACROSS FROM
THE CEMETERY. DAY.

The raincoat man is standing waiting for a bus, at the bus
stop, outside a working man's tavern.

ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man, still weeping. Scott
walks up to the man. Each holds a copy of the program from
the funeral. The man looks down at the program, and then up
to Scott.

                      SCOTT
                 (beat)
            Terrible thing.
                 (the man nods)
            Did you know him?

The man nods. Beat. He turns back to Scott, looking for
sympathy. Anguished.

                      MAN
            Did you know him...?
                 (Scott nods. Pause. Portentiously:)
            Where did you know him from?

                                                             97.


                      SCOTT
                 (pause)
            ...you know.

                      MAN
                 (pause. Nods)
            He wasn't in the accounting
            office. You knew that...

                      SCOTT
            Yes. I Did.

The man begins weeping heavily. Scott puts his arm around him.

                      MAN
            I didn't think, he told anyone
            what he did. Because...because...
                 (he looks for sympathy)
            I...

                      SCOTT
            A few of us knew.
                 (pause)


The man takes out a small photo in a leather case - we see
it is a smiling photo of the Secret Service Agent, Gaines.

                      MAN
            And all he cared    about was doing
            his duty...that's    all...that's
            all... He used to    tell me...
                 (the man is    now overcome)


                      SCOTT
            I'm so sorry.

                      MAN
            He was supposed to see me that
            night...After his
            "shift"...We...His wife...

Scott nods his understanding.

                      SCOTT
            Did she know? His wife. Did she
            know?

                      MAN
            How could she? How could
            she...she didn't know him...
                 (pause)
            Oh, the poor children...

                                                          98.


The man begins shaking, and Scott embraces him to comfort him.

ANGLE, INT. THE WORKING MAN'S BAR. DAY.

Scott and the man, at the end of the bar. A few construction
types enter. As Scott bends his head next to the man,
speaking low.

                      MAN
            ...he was going to come to me
            that night...after...

                      SCOTT
            ...after his shift.

                      MAN
            ...his shift - yes...

ANGLE, on a Burly Man, in construction clothes, who is
standing next to them.

                      BURLY MAN
            ...excuse me...

                      MAN
            ...after, after he'd finished
            driving him...

                         SCOTT
            ...him...?

                      BURLY MAN
                 (as he puts a hand on Scott)
            I said...

                      SCOTT
                 (as he turns to the
                 man, who is backing
                 his way out of the bar)
            ...driving him..? Did you say
            "him"?
                 (he reaches out to the
                 effeminate man)


                      BURLY MAN
            Yeah. It's a man's world, pal -
            but you're in the wrong bar.

He turns Scott around, and pushes Scott deeper into the room,
away from the other man, who is now going out of the door.
Scott moves toward him and the Burly Man tries to stop him.

                                                             99.


Scott strikes him several times, and starts toward the door,
where, as he exits the bar, he sees the effeminate man, on
the bus, and pulling away.

Scott starts to move toward the bus. There is a hand on his
shoulder, and a second man from the bar is whirling Scott to
face him. Scott shakes him off and starts after the bus. The
second man restrains him.

                      SECOND MAN
            ...what the fuck did you do to
            my friend...?

In the B.G. We see the first man rise from the sidewalk, and
move toward Scott. Scott struggles to follow the bus, when
the second man assaults him. Scott is now fighting the two
men, who manoeuvre him toward an alley.

As Scott's back is to the alley we see a Third Man emerge
from the shadows, and throw a garrotte around Scott's neck.

Scott headbutts this man, who hauls Scott off his feet.
Scott belts him again, and stomps on his instep. And turns
into him. He elbows this man as the other two men advance
toward him, in the alleyway. The garrotte man falls.

Scott kicks the garrotte man in the temple. And draws his
pistol. Beat.

The men in the mouth of the alleyway retreat.

ANGLE. On the street. We see them get into a van which has
just pulled up.

ANGLE on Scott. Standing. Shivering. As he looks around the
alleyway. He moves back to the fallen garrotte man.

ANGLE. Scott standing over the man. He sees something and
bends down.

ANGLE HIS POV. In the man's backpocket is a program from the
funeral.

ANGLE, Scott standing, looking at the program. We hear the
phone ringing. Scott puts the phone to his ear.

                      SCOTT
            ...where are you...? No. Tell me
            later. Look: LOOK: Forget the
            boat house. Look:
                 (pause)
            Yes, tell me in...tel...look:
            tell me when...GET OUT OF THERE.
                      (MORE)

                                                            100.


                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
            GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW. TELL
            ME WHEN YOU SEE ME. MEET ME
            "WHERE...WHERE THE GUY MADE THE
            PHONECALL" - ONE HALF-HOUR...

Scott stops speaking, and looks down at something.

ANGLE, his POV. Across the street. We see an unmarked sedan
pull up and two men get out of the car. And begin to look
around. One sees Scott, and motions to the other one, and
they both start in his direction. They stop, for a moment,
as if confused.

ANGLE, their POV. The street corner, empty of Scott.

EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Copley Square. Scott. Coming into the square.

ANGLE, the open-air phone stanchion we saw in the earlier
sequence. It is festooned, as before, with ads for escort
services and phone sex.

ANGLE, on Scott, getting, hurriedly, out of a taxi cab, on
the outskirts of the square.

ANGLE, his POV, scanning the square for Anton. Scott looks
at his watch, and he looks up.

ANGLE HIS POV. The figure of Anton, walking from the far
side of the square, toward the phone booth.

ANGLE, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds
toward the phone booth.

As Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads
toward Anton. Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the
streetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward
another car. Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton,
and he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away.

ANGLE, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on,
aghast.

ANGLE Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as
the car disappears.

ANGLE. CU. Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following,
looking in the direction in which he was pointing.

ANGLE Scott's POV. The telephone kiosk. Scott walks into his
POV, to the kiosk. He looks down at the pile of trash on the
shelf.

                                                         101.


He looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around
the interior. He sees that, stuck in one of them is the
"Rogers Rangers" card, which Anton showed him earlier. He
pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck. He looks down
at it inquisitively. We read in an insert: "Rule #11: Don't
ever march home the same way.

Take a different route, so you won't be ambushed." He then
sees that there is something else behind the ad. He tears
the ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a
folded envelope falls out from behind the ad. He picks up
the envelope. We see that it is the old yellowed envelope
from the beach house. It is printed "Hanson Marine -
Everything For The Boat", and we see, on it, the drawing of
the old power boat. We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it,
tear off the end, and pour something out into his hand. We
see his face, and then pan down to see the object in the
envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs
of Laura Newton.

EXT. BOATHOUSE, ESSEX. DUSK.

A wind is blowing from the sea. Scott turns up the collar of
his jacket. We see the house in the BG and Scott, walking
along the patio, the sea beyond him. We see him stop and
kneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook. He
sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling.
The wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident
he has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it,
blinking, and squinting. He turns his head.

ANGLE, HIS POV. Beyond the property line. Beyond the hedges
and on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle
dwelling, the small white toolshed.

ANGLE, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its
proximity to the Essex House. He begins to walk toward it.

ANGLE. Scott. At the small white toolshed. He stoops, and we
see he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle. He
stands, he takes out a small spotter's scope.

ANGLE. HIS POV. His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen-
covered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit
of a sign.

ANGLE. Scott, looking at the sign in the window. He rubs the
pollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window,
drawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-).

ANGLE XCU Scott.

                      SCOTT
            ...ohmigod...

                                                            102.


INT. SLEAZY HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Scott, wearing just skivvies, is asleep on the bed, an empty
pint bottle of booze on the night stand. We hear the
television on low, showing talking heads narrating the
funeral of Laura Newton.

"Our Redhead, America's Sweetheart", et cetera. We see a
photo of her in her signature red crescent earrings. Next to
Scott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same
red crescent earring.

ANGLE, the line of light under the door to the hallway is
occupied by a pair of feet.

ANGLE. A hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor. Below
it, on the floor, the creased 'Rogers Rangers' card, and
several days worth of newspapers.

ANGLE XCU Scott, on the bed. Unshaven. We see his eyes come
open.

ANGLE on Scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the Rangers
card, on which we read: "Rule #15: Don't sleep past dawn -
Dawn's when the French and Indians attack", and comes up
with an automatic pistol.

ANGLE the door, as we see the door handle move slightly.

ANGLE on Scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his
side.

ANGLE HIS POV. In the doorway beyond, we see a Bellboy,
holding a small paper bag, looking shocked.

Scott shoves the Bellboy back away from the door, and
glances, both ways, down the hall.

                      SCOTT
            What the hell are you doing?

                      BELLBOY
                 (showing the package)
            I...I brought you...

                      SCOTT
            Why're you screwing with the
            door...?

                       BELLBOY
            I...I...

Scott drags him into the room.

                                                         103.


                      SCOTT
            Why're you screwing with the
            door...?

Scott frisks him roughly. The terrified Bellboy shows a "Do
Not Disturb" sign, which he holds.

                      BELLBOY
            I took the...I took the sign
            off...
                 (pause)
            You had the sign on the door.
            F'they saw me...f'they saw me,
            knocking on a door, the sign
            on...they'd...
                 (Scott relaxes somewhat.
                 The Bellboy proffers
                 the package)
            An, I...I figured, you needed...
                 (he hands the package
                 to Scott, who takes
                 out a pint bottle of booze)
            You told me you wanted this at
            Ten...

                      SCOTT
            ...yeah. Thanks.

                      BELLBOY
                 (begins to calm down a bit)
            ...I don't know why you...

                      SCOTT
            You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong.

He begins to look through his pockets. As the Bellboy stands,
looking at the television.

ANGLE on Scott, the television beyond him. As he goes
through the pockets of his jeans. He then goes through the
pockets of his jacket, and throws various objects on the bed.
Some coins, some scraps of paper. A book of matches, some
crumpled cigarettes. He hands some bills to the Bellboy.

                      SCOTT
            There you go, Pal. Hold on...

                       BELLBOY
                  (pause)
            Sure. I just...I just wanted to
            help.

                                                            104.


ANGLE, on Scott. As he rummages through the pile on the bed.
The TV shows photos of Laura Newton, wearing her red
crescent earrings.

Scott picks up a cigarette and the book of matches on the bed.

Part of the pile shows a tabloid paper - a photo of   Laura,
an insert of her father weeping at the funeral, and   the
caption "Goodbye, Baby". He bends down and picks up   the
Rogers Rangers card. And looks at it. He shakes his   head. As
we see the Bellboy leave the room. Beat.

INT. DARK, PANELLED CONFESSIONAL. NIGHT.

XCU on Scott, as he thinks for a moment, then speaks.

                      SCOTT
            It's been...quite a while since
            my last confession. That...that
            "transpired". On the rear face
            of a hill, in a mortar attack.
                 (pause)
            And I confessed that I was
            frightened.
                 (pause)
            And I have to confess, I'm
            frightened now.
                 (pause. He smiles weakly)
            'Nother "irregular Confession".

He raises a shotglass to his lips, and drinks. He makes a
"another one" gesture. Pause.

                      SCOTT
            ...I'm about as frightened as
            I'm comfortable being.
                 (pause)
            And that's why...I involved you.
                 (pause)
            Which, I suppose, was shameful.

ANGLE, as a waiter comes, with a fresh drink. We see that we
are in a very dark, quiet, smoky, panelled bar. The waiter
leaves, and reveals, beyond him, Jackie Black, the female
Sergeant we met at the training facility scenes. The waiter
looks at her, inquiring silently, if she wants anything. She
shakes her head.

                                                            105.


                      JACKIE BLACK
            Now: you did me the honor to
            Call me. Now: you tell me how I
            might help.
                 (pause)
            There in't nobody here, but two
            people in Green.
                 (pause)


Scott, looks around, he takes up a tabloid newspaper, which
has been resting on the seat of the booth. We see it is a
"funeral" edition, concerning the death of Laura Newton.

We see the large, color photo of Laura, her red hair, and,
in an insert, her father, at the gravesite, hiding his face.
The caption reads "Goodbye, Baby". Scott leans over, and
whispers to Black, his deepest secret.

                      SCOTT
                 (pointing at the paper)
            ...this girl's alive...

                      JACKIE BLACK
            Then, you'd better go get her.

EXT. SANITORIUM. DAY.

Scott, shaven, neat, and determined, standing at a bus stop.
Reading a newspaper. Behind him, a large iron fence.

ANGLE INS. The newspaper shows "The Tragic Death of Laura
Newton", and photos of the accident. And a photo of a
distraught woman in sunglasses, being held up by two friends.

ANGLE on Scott. As he looks across the street. Surreptitiously.

ANGLE HIS POV. A plainclothes car, with two people in it,
looking vaguely in his direction.

ANGLE on the bus, as it pulls into the stop. We see various
people start onto the bus. At the last moment Scott, at the
back of the line, sheers away.

ANGLE, INT. THE PLAINCLOTHES CAR. The bus pulling away from
the bus stop, the chainlink fence beyond it, and, beyond
that, a vaguely institutional-looking Colonial building.

INT. SANITORIUM. DAY.

A nurses station, Scott moving through the area, just asking
directions of an older woman, obviously a semi-invalid.

                                                            106.


ANGLE INT. SANITORIUM. The woman is Mrs. Newton. She walks
with a companion, she wears sunglasses, and starts out of
the sanitorium. As Scott walks up, some yards behind her,
following her out onto a roofed porch. The woman moves to
the far end of the porch, obviously weeping. Scott enters
the porch, and stands for a moment. Beat.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
            ...terrible thing, grief...

Scott turns to her, to see a lovely woman in her late
fifties, sitting on a lounge chair, a robe over her legs,
indicating the weeping woman.

Scott nods, and takes something from his pocket. He starts
toward the weeping woman, but the other woman holds him with
her voice.

                      WOMAN
            ...you want to comfort them, but
            you don't know how.
                 (pause)
            I always think it's better to
            Leave Them Alone...

Scott nods his acceptance of her wisdom, and begins to start
toward the woman.

                      SCOTT
                 (of Mrs. Newton, and
                 the woman, talking to her)
            A relative?

                       WOMAN
            A psychic.
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Well.
                 (pause)
            Can we blame her...?
                 (he gestures, meaning,
                 we get comfort where
                 we can find it)


                      WOMAN
            That's right.

Scott begins to move toward Mrs. Newton. The woman on the
lounge chair sits up.

                                                         107.


                      WOMAN
            ...who are you...?

                      SCOTT
                 (moving off)
            United States Secret Service.

The woman moves her blanket to reveal a pistol which she holds.

                      WOMAN
            Guess again, 'cause I'm the
            Secret Service, and you follow
            my directions or I will shoot
            you dead. Spread your hands to
            your sides, please...
                 (Scott spreads his
                 hands to his sides)
            Open them...

He opens his hands to show the red crescent earring. We see
the demeanor of the woman in back of him change, as she sees
the earring. She comes up to Scott, and he turns around. She
looks up, asking, mutely, what it means.

INT. SMALL SANITORIUM ROOM. DAY.

                      DONNY
                 (sotto, unable to stop
                 her invective)
            ...the motherfuckers pulled the
            Detail off of her...He was in
            town. Her father was in town,
            they pulled the Secret Service
            Detail off her, to take him
            tomcatting. He's been doing it
            for years. That's what they do.
            They turn the Secret Service
            into a bunch of pimps. He took
            her protection, she got snatched...

                      SCOTT
            He'd let her die?

A female Agent knocks at the door and sticks her head in and
Donny gestures "rotate".

                      FEMALE AGENT
            ...leaving the post...

Donny gestures that she has heard. The Agent leaves and the
door is closed.

                                                         108.


                      DONNY
                 (meaning, "this is my surmise")
            The start of a campaign: Your
            daughter got kidnapped because
            you were out getting laid?

                      SCOTT
            Her father would let her die...?

                      DONNY
            Who knows if he knows. His
            'people' would let her die in a
            heartbeat.

                      SCOTT
            ...her mother...?

                      DONNY
                 (pause. She takes up
                 the earring and she
                 begins to weep. She
                 looks beseechingly at Scott)
            I'm her mother...

She takes out a small, tattered, cheap earring box.

ANGLE INS. We see the empty place for holding two earrings,
and a small arcade photo of a five-year-old Laura Newton,
and this woman, Donny, fifteen years younger. They are
hugging. Scott turns over the photo to read, in a childish
scrawl, "Donny, you can keep the box, cause I'll never take
them off". Donny starts to weep.

                      SCOTT
            I need some money.
                 (Donny looks up at him questioningly)
            I'm going to get the girl back.

                      DONNY
            What can I do?

                      SCOTT
            I need money. I need a lot of money.

                      DONNY
                 (of Mrs. Newton)
            I've been signing her checks for
            years.

                                                         109.


                       SCOTT
            Alright...
                 (he scribbles a figure
                 on a napkin)
            Can you go this high, that's
            what I need...

                        DONNY
                 (as   she looks down at
                 the   figure on the paper)
            ...I...I   don't...is there
            anywhere   else you...

ANGLE. Both look to the side.

ANGLE, their POV. One of the Secret Service Agents, looking
askance at Scott. Does a double-take. And begins to raise
his cuff mike to his lips to speak.

ANGLE, on Donny, as she sees this, and turns around.

ANGLE, her POV. The empty room. Scott vanished.

INT. NEW YORK CITY OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.

A very beautiful young woman in a business suit, in an
elevator. The doors open and Scott, dressed in a suit, gets
in. He turns to face the front. They ride up in silence.

The doors open on a mezzanine. There are several men at the
end of the mezzanine. Scott starts to get out, and the girl
tries to stop him. He shoves her roughly back into the
elevator. Several of the men come toward Scott, and a large,
portly businessman in his forties (AVI) calls them off.
Scott comes forward.

                      AVI
            Didn't they tell you not to come?

                       SCOTT
            Well, I guess I wasn't paying
            attention.
                 (pause)


                       AVI
            Five years ago they told me you
            were dead.

                      SCOTT
            You want to gossip, or you want
            to do business...?

Avi motions Scott to come with him.

                                                          110.


ANGLE, Avi's hitters. One starts to take out a phone - Avi
waves him to stop - HOLD on the hitters.

ANGLE, Avi and Scott, as they sit, near the edge of the
mezzanine.

                      AVI
            Bobby; this is an American girl...?

                      SCOTT
            If that were so?

                      AVI
            If that were so, why don't your
            people go and fetch her...?

What if I'm speaking for them...?

Avi nods, meaning "yeah, sure".

                      AVI
            ...they send a hitter to
            negotiate...?
                 (pause)
            My question is: have you forgot
            your catechism...?

                      SCOTT
            And what's the answer?

                      AVI
            The answer is Go Home.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, that's a good one.

                      AVI
            ...you're at the Big Table here.

                      SCOTT
            I know where I am.

                      AVI
            Well, then, you better talk to
            me using the Decimal System.

                      SCOTT
            Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil,
            hardware, and com.

                      AVI
            And com to what? I cannot give you.

                                                         111.


                      SCOTT
            Well, you could, when you where
            in the Boy Scouts.

                      AVI
            Yes, but I am not in the Boy
            Scouts anymore. You heard the
            private sector?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah.

                      AVI
            Well. That's where you found me.
            And here's what it costs.

He writes a number on a sheet of paper.

                      SCOTT
                 (looks at the paper)
            ...you're out of your mind.

                      AVI
            No, you're out of your fucking
            mind, and you're out of your
            league, and my advice to
            you:...before some mercantile
            soul shops you.
                 (pause. In disgust, he
                 picks up the paper,
                 crosses out what we
                 wrote, and puts in a
                 new number)
            ...for this job, that's what it
            costs...

                      SCOTT
            ...that's what it costs...?

                      AVI
            That's what it costs you.
                 (pause)
            Go home, Bobby.

EXT. PALATIAL ESTATE. DAY.

We see a woman getting into a Range Rover, in the vast
gravel drive outside of an estate.

A man comes out of the house, with a cup of coffee, hurrying
out to kiss his wife goodbye. He does so. She drives off.

                                                           112.


He finishes the cup of coffee, puts it down outside his door,
closes the door, and looks quickly at his watch, and hurries
to his Jaguar, which he puts in gear, and it starts down the
drive.

We see it is the Businessman from the whorehouse.

ANGLE on another car, coming down the drive, which smashes
into the Jaguar.

ANGLE on Scott, who gets hurriedly out of the car. He goes
out to the Jag, and drags the stunned man from his car, and
toward the house.

ANGLE INT. A SUMPTUOUS STUDY, PALATIAL ESTATE. DAY.
Beautiful Greek and Roman artifacts line the walls, on
lighted shelves. Scott drags the stunned and abraided
Businessman into the study. Scott throws him into a chair.

                      SCOTT
            Remember me...?

ANGLE Scott, as he takes out the Businessman's card, and
looks at it.

                      SCOTT
            ...well, I guess you do have
            friends in High Places...I mean
            here you are home, n'all...
                 (he picks up now one,
                 now another piece of
                 exquisite statuary,
                 and smashes it to the ground)
            And now we're gonna see if you
            also got all that money that you
            spoke of.
                 (he takes out a
                 videotape box)
            This here's a Short Subject, if
            you know what I mean. Of you in
            Carnal Congress with an Underage
            Girl. A PROSTITUE, A MINOR, AND
            SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...
                 (he holds up another videotape)
            There's another...you know how
            cheap it is to make a copy...?

                      BUSINESSMAN
            ...what do you want?

                      SCOTT
            I want what you promised me...

                                                         113.


                      BUSINESSMAN
                 (as if reluctant to
                 impart the information)
            ...I've, I've already made a
            deal with...

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, but you haven't made a
            deal with me...So, today is Your
            Lucky Day, cause you get to Do,
            what Most Men only Dream of: You
            get to make Another Human Being
            Happy.

He brings over a telephone, and gives it to the Businessman.
Scott finds himself behind a large desk.

He looks down at photos of the smiling Businessman, in
various poses, with two young girls, obviously his daughters.

                      SCOTT
                 (softly)
            You had your fun, now pay for it,
            Jim. Get your bank on the phone.
            We're going to transfer some money.

The Businessman pauses, then picks up the phone.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            ..."how about that".

                      BUSINESSMAN
            ...do you know how much trouble
            you're in...?

                      SCOTT
            Yes. And that's the difference
            between you and me.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT STREET. DAY.

Scott, getting out of his car, rounds a corner. We see a car
coming down this street, rather quickly. Scott retreats into
a doorway.

ANGLE, HIS POV. The car blinks its lights three times.

ANGLE EXT. THE STREET. We see the car slow almost to a stop,
Scott emerges from his doorway. As the car's rear door is
opened, Scott gets in.

                                                 114.


INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE. DAY.

Avi and Scott, at a small table.

                       AVI
            Maskala is a suburban villa, in
            Dubai. The Friends of your Friend,
                 (he gestures at a photo
                 of Assani)
            Operate there, if you will, a
            "halfway house". For the young
            women they have induced, coerced
            or drugged into spending their
            short lives. As the whores of
            Arabian tourists. Of late the
            girls have been, in the main,
            from the former Sov-Bloc. Now
            and again, a North American Girl,
            if she is exceedingly
            lovely,...blonde, usually
            blonde...
                 (he passes the photos
                 of very beautiful young
                 girls across the table,
                 to Scott)
            Will, unfortunately, find her
            way to Dubai. They travel drugged,
            they are -
                 (he searches for the word)
            - "tidied up", and sold. For
            some reason, most of them are
            sold to Yemen.
                 (pause)
            The girls are generally held, in
            Dubai, until the end of the month.
                 (he checks his watch
                 and looks significantly
                 at it)
            When the Merrymakers fly in to
            examine them. And take their
            purchases home.

                      SCOTT
            ...and then?

                       AVI
                  (shrugs)
            That is "and then".
                  (pause)
            This is a floor plan of the
            building where the girls are
            held, this is the security
            arrangements, this is the watch
            plan.
                       (MORE)

                                                         115.


                      AVI (CONT'D)
                 (he checks his watch
                 and raises his eyebrows)
            The girls are taken from the
            house in Maskala, to the Royale
            Hotel, I presume you will hit
            them in transit...?

Scott opens another envelope which Avi has passed him. As he
looks at the documents he pours out.

                      SCOTT
                 (reads)
            ..."Jameson Construction"...They
            know we're there...?

                      AVI
            I hope not.
                 (he shows documents to Scott)
            The conex container for the exfil,
            also Jameson Construction.
                 (he gestures at the
                 materials on the table)
            A passport for the Young Girl...
                 (he shrugs)
            Between fifteen and twenty-five,
            they all look alike.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks at the passport)
            Is that your experience...?

                      AVI
            Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried
            to match it to a Current Photo...

ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks, questioningly at Avi. Avi
takes a photo from his desk and passes it to Scott. It shows,
through a long lens, blurry and grainy, a photo of what is
obviously the platinum-haired Laura Newton, sitting on a bed,
in a barred room.

                      AVI
            ...she was there twelve hours ago.

                      SCOTT
            Who took the photo?

                      AVI
                 (shrugs)
            How would I know...?
                 (pause)

                                                          116.


                      SCOTT
            What does the bonus cost?

                       AVI
                 (shrugs)
            A gesture of Friendship. But. We
            thought: if you see some of the
            Yemenins -
                 (he shows Scott candid
                 photos of several
                 middle-aged, bearded
                 middle-eastern looking men)
            Any of these, in
            particular...would you say Hello
            to them?

Scott scoops up the documents, and stands.

                      SCOTT
            Who else have you done a favor
            for, Avi?

Avi shakes his head, and wags his finger, as if to say, "No,
in all sincerity..."

                      AVI
            Bobby: the world runs on manners.

Beat. Scott takes an envelope, and hands it to Avi, who
opens it. He opens his mouth to speak.

                      SCOTT
            The last third on exfil, in
            Geneva. Me and the Girl. As agreed.

                      AVI
            That's not what I was going to say.

                      SCOTT
            What were you going to say...?
                 (pause)
            ...the Last Third in Geneva...
                 (he exits)


EXT. ROOFTOP, DUBAI. DUSK.

Scott, on a rooftop, behind a raised elevator housing. Scott
takes out a pair of binoculars, and Scott leans around the
elevator housing.

ANGLE HIS POV. Across the way, the window, and the ornate
scrollwork bars, in which we, earlier, saw the photo takes
on Laura Newton.

                                                            117.


ANGLE on Scott, as he comes back behind cover, and nods to
himself, picking up his yellow bag.

ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET. Scott, walking down the street,
beyond him a building with an ornate scrollwork barred gate
over its courtyard door. In the courtyard beyond, two
Mercedes 600's.

As Scott walks past the trelliswork it begins to open. A
delivery truck is ushered through the gate, by an armed
guard. Scott stops, to let the truck pass.

ANGLE HIS POV. As he turns his head to the side.

ANGLE HIS POV. Walking from one outbuilding, across the
courtyard, beyond the gate, accompanied by a minder, is
Laura Newton. She is obviously drugged, disoriented, and is
held up by the guard. He gets into a conversation with a
woman, dressed as a matron, who comes out of the building
they have just vacated. And she stands, for an instant,
untended.

ANGLE on Scott, the gate open, as the gate guard ushers
through the delivery van, and Laura Newton stands several
yards away.

ANGLE XCU, Laura Newton, as she looks in his direction, and
her eyes begin to focus, as if trying to make sense of what
she is seeing.

ANGLE, her minder, who reacts to a change in her attitude,
and looks at her, and, then, follows the direction of her
gaze to the gate.

ANGLE HIS POV. The delivery truck coming through the gate,
as the gate closes behind it. The street beyond it, empty.

ANGLE INT. THE COURTYARD. As the delivery truck pulls in,
and Laura, escorted by her guard, is taken back into the
main house. She turns to look back, groggily, wonderingly,
at the street, and is pushed into the door. As she does so,
we see the delivery truck pull up to the spot she just
vacated, and the delivery man gets out and opens a rear door,
on which we see scrawled, in the dirt, the "Picasso" symbol.

ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET CORNER. Scott turns the corner, and
gets into a car, driven by Jones, which comes to the curb.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. In the backseat, Scott, another man
sitting next to him, SMITH, dressed as a construction worker.
The man starts to speak. And Scott shushes him, takes out a
notebook and a pencil, and begins to make notes.

                                                         118.


EXT. CAR, DUBAI. NIGHT.

A deserted streetcorner. Various shuttered posh shops. Scott
walking across the street.

ANGLE CU on Scott, as he paces, as he walks.

                      SCOTT
            ...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

The camera takes him to the middle of the street. A right-
hand turn, a tight corner. He looks to his left.

ANGLE HIS POV. Beyond him, we see, several streets off, the
sign of the "Royale" hotel.

Scott beckons, and the man, Smith, comes out of the shadows.
He and Scott walk to a small passageway, at the corner.

Camera takes them through the passageway, where we see Jones,
standing by his car, in an alley.

                       SCOTT
            It's good.
                 (to Jones)
            It's very good.
                 (Jones nods his thanks)
            The charge takes the car out...
                 (to Smith)
            We got the flashbangs fore and
            aft, You hit the driver, follow
            down the driver's side, the car
            ain't going nowhere, the muscle
            gets out, I cap em, I go with
            the girl.
                 (he points to Jones.
                 He points to the car.
                 Jones nods. To Smith)
            You exfil on your own, we're on
            to the airport.

ANGLE, tight on Scott, and Jones.

                       SCOTT
            At the airport. When we hit the
            Conex. When you Seal Us In...you
            walk away.

                      JONES
            I understand.

                                                            119.


                      SCOTT
            I cannot have heat on it. Now: I
            know: that you want to protect
            the package. But: you have to
            walk away. And que sera, sera.

                      JONES
            I won't look back.

INT. WAREHOUSE ROOM. NIGHT.

Scott, at a desk, looking over his plans. A photo of Laura
Newton on his desk. Beyond him Smith and Jones are cleaning
and assembling weapons. Scott takes out his switchblade and
begins to hone it. Scott looks into the mechanism of the
knife. Peers intently, turns it over and raps it on the
table. We see a small seed fall out. Smith turns to the
sound, and looks inquisitively at Scott.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he picks the seed
                 up, answering Smith's
                 unspoken question)
            ...it's an appleseed.

Smith nods as if to say,"If you say so".

Scott reaches over to a box of Q-Tips, which sits on the
table along with other cleansing paraphernalia, and dips one
in the solvent bottle, and begins to clean the interior of
his switchblade.

ANGLE XCU on Scott, as he cleans the interior of his knife.
His face freezes...Scott leans over, and gestures at a
tweezers as part of Smith's cleaning kit. Smith nods "okay".

ANGLE INSERT. The interior of the knife. A small, wafer thin
electronic device adhering to the interior.

ANGLE on Scott. As he turns his back on the group. We see,
in an insert. He holds the electronic device up for scrutiny,
in the tweezers. He walks toward the windows of the warehouse.

                      SMITH
                 (as he cleans his
                 firearms, generally,
                 as if speaking of the universe)
            "Johnny Appleseed", eh?

                      SCOTT
            ...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace...

We hear a car driving up, outside the warehouse. He looks
out of the window.

                                                            120.


ANGLE, HIS POV. Just seen, the nose of a small SUV, around
the corner, three men, getting out of the car.

ANGLE INT. WAREHOUSE DAY. Scott walks into a corridor of the
warehouse. He looks down an industrial staircase, and sees
the door at the bottom begin to open, stealthily.

ANGLE, camera takes Scott to a small, filthy bathroom. He
opens the door.

ANGLE, at the bottom of the stairs, Stoddard, with two
henchmen, heavily armed, look up.

ANGLE THEIR POV. Scott walking into the bathroom.

ANGLE, a floor of the warehouse. Stoddard, and his
accomplices, coming up the stairs to the floor, which holds
Scott. There are several closed doors. One of the men
consults a small hand-held 'GPS' unit, and points at one of
the doors. The men take up position around this door.
Stoddard nods, and they open fire through the door.

ANGLE, INT. THE BATHROOM. The men kick down the door, to
find the small cubicle-like room empty. One of them looks
around, and sees, and removes the small wafer-thin electronic
device from the top of the cistern. He shows it to Stoddard,
who throws it down in disgust. As he, followed by his men,
exit the room.

ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET. NIGHT. We see the small SUV parked
around the corner from the warehouse, a black clad driver,
sitting in the car, watching the warehouse.

The door is wrenched open, and we see Scott, the small
yellow duffle over his shoulder, drag the driver from the
car, and clout him to the ground. Scott gets into the car,
which begins to drive off.

INT. "MASKALA HOUSE" (THE HOUSE WITH THE ORNATE SCROLLWORK).
DUBAI. NIGHT.

ANGLE, Laura Newton, drugged, listless, sitting on the bed
in the small room. We hear a large explosion, and Laura gets
up, and moves toward the door of her room. She hears another
explosion, and shouts coming from outside her door. She is
reaching for the handle of the door, when the door opens,
and one of her Bodyguards opens the door, and addresses her.

                      BODYGUARD
            ...stay in your room, and...

He turns as another explosion is heard, coming from the
interior of the house. As he turns we hear glass breaking,
and see Scott entering through the window behind Laura.

                                                             121.


The Bodyguard turns, and Scott raises a silenced    pistol, and
shoots the Bodyguard twice. The Bodyguard falls,    Scott moves
to him, and drags him inside the room. He raises    his pistol
gesturing "shush" to Laura, and moves her toward    the window.

                         LAURA
            ...who...?

He uses the rope outside   the   window to improvise a sling,
for Laura, and drapes it   over   her head, and under her arms.
Scott picks her up, and   holds   her for a moment. She starts
to speak. And he answers   her   question.

                      SCOTT
            Stay by me.

He hesitates for a moment. We hear another explosion, he
nods, as if to say "That's what we're waiting for", and
passes her out of the window, and begins lowering her to the
ground.

ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Laura, on the rope, reaching the
ground.

ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Scott, as he turns to the sound of the
door opening, two men come through the door, and he shoots them.

ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Scott puts Laura into the SUV and
gets behind the driver's seat. He puts the car in gear, and
it begins to drive off.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Laura turns to face him.

                      LAURA
            ...they said they were going to
            take care of me...

                      SCOTT
            I'm going to take care of you.
            You hold on, now.
                 (as Scott drives he
                 reloads his weapons)


                      LAURA
                 (lazily)
            Who are you?

                      SCOTT
            ...you remember, Baby, we went
            to high school together...
                 (pause)
            You dropped your earring.

                                                            122.


She shakes her head. Drugged. Trying to make sense of the
proceedings.

                      SCOTT
            You're Picasso, right...? That's
            who you are...

He draws the Picasso sign on the windshield, she looks at it,
having trouble focusing.

                      LAURA
            ...they're going to send me to a
            Party.

                       SCOTT
            No, Baby, you're going Home.
                  (pause)
            You're just taking the long way
            home.

ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. Moving through the streets. The airport
just becoming visible in the background.

INT. BARE ROOM. DUBAI. NIGHT.

Laura, asleep, at a small cardtable. Out of the window we
see an expanse of desert and scrub. Her head is down. Scott
enters the room, he moves a chair in front of the door,
moves to Laura, and manhandles her to a small cot, and
closes the shutters to the window.

                      SCOTT
            ...I told you to stay on the bed.

We see her wake and look around, trying to place herself.

ANGLE on Scott, as he takes out a notebook and begins to
make notes in it.

                      SCOTT
            ...you're going travelling.

                      LAURA
            ...what...?

                      SCOTT
            ...we're going to take a little
            trip.

She takes out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, and extracts
the last one. She takes out a match.

                      SCOTT
            ...put that away.

                                                            123.


                      LAURA
            ...I need a smoke.

                      SCOTT
            Y'can't smoke it. American
            tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the
            desert air.

He looks down his list, and nods. He takes a bandana from
his pocket and hands it to her.

                      SCOTT
            Put that on. Over your head.

                      LAURA
            Whatsamatter, you don't like
            Blondes...?

                      SCOTT
            Whole world likes Blondes. That's
            why you're here. Put the bandana on.

                      LAURA
                 (as she tries to light
                 the cigarette)
            I need a smoke.
                 (He takes it away from
                 her, and crumbles it.)
            ...gimme the fucken smoke.

He shushes her, and moves to the window.

ANGLE, EXT. The window. The first gleam of dawn. And, far
off, a Muezzin is heard chanting morning prayers. Laura
moves toward him, unbuttoning her blouse.

                      LAURA
            I could make you give me the smoke.

He slaps her lightly in the face.

                      SCOTT
            Keep it together.
                 (he takes a small
                 hypodermic kit)
            Keep it together, or I'm gonna
            give you a shot and carry you out.

She reacts violently to the sight of the needle. Beat. Then,
she sits on the bed and cries self-pityingly.

                      LAURA
            Nobody Cares about me...

                                                         124.


Hold. On Scott. And we take him back to a small shelf near
the door. He takes down what we see is an ashtray, overfull
with yellow-brown cigarette butts. He takes the ashtray to
the small table, takes out his knife, and begins shredding
the butts, and gathering the tobacco into a pile.

                       SCOTT
             ...that's right...

                       LAURA
             ...I'm just a whore...They
             wouldn't even come get me...

                       SCOTT
             They sent me...

Scott looks at the pile of tobacco. He extracts the "Rogers
Rangers" card from his pocket and looks at it. We read, in
an insert: "Rule #13: Every night, you'll be told where to
Meet, if Surrounded by Superior Force".

ANGLE, on Scott, as he very precisely peels the card into
two thin halves, and rolls one of the halves into a
cigarette, using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray. He
takes the cigarette to Laura. As a peace offering. She takes
it. Beat.

                       LAURA
             Did my father send you?

                       SCOTT
                  (as he lights her cigarette)
             ...that's right.

                       LAURA
                  (derisively)
             One man.

                        SCOTT
             One riot, one Ranger, you ever
             hear that?

ANGLE, on Scott, as he hears a car outside the window. He
draws a pistol and moves to the window, and looks down. He
gestures Laura to be quiet.

ANGLE EXT. The window. In the small, deserted street. A car
pulls up. A man gets out, and looks around. Beat. Another
man, and a woman, and two small children come out of the low
house and get into the car, which drives away.

                                                           125.


                      LAURA
            Leonides, the King of Sparta,
            when a neighboring state would
            beg for Military Aid. Would send
            One Man.

                      SCOTT
            ...well, there you go.

                      LAURA
            ...you ever hear that?

                      SCOTT
            No. I think we went to different
            schools.

He looks at her. Beat. She hands him the cigarette. And he
takes a drag, and passes it back. He checks his watch.

                      SCOTT
            ...put the bandana on.

                       LAURA
                 (softly)
            Did you hear the one about the
            king who turned his daughter
            into Gold?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah - I heard that one.

Beat. She turns away, and cries.

                      LAURA
            ...I don't want to go home.

                      SCOTT
            I didn't ask you.

EXT. DUBAI AIRPORT. DAY.

A long view of the airport.

ANGLE, a small delivery van we saw earlier. Parked in an
industrial area.

ANGLE INT THE VAN. Laura, dozing in the passengers seat.
Scott, sitting in the driver's seat, alert, watching.

ANGLE HIS POV. Seen beyond the corner of an industrial
building, beyond a chainlink fence, the airport.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Laura wakes with a start, and looks around.

                                                           126.


                      LAURA
            I don't know where we are...

                      SCOTT
            You just keep it together.

ANGLE Scott as he looks up to the sound of a plane.

ANGLE HIS POV. Directly over their heads, a small bizjet, on
final, about to touch down.

ANGLE, the chainlink fence. Scott and Laura at the fence
protecting the airport. Scott moves aside the pre-cut
section of fence, and gestures him through.

ANGLE, inside the fence. Laura and Scott moving to the
protection of a small hangar.

ANGLE, beyond them, we see the bizjet come to a halt, on the
tarmac, and turn. We see blazoned, on its side, "Global News".

ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, now inside the small hangar.
Scott moves to a small locker and extracts a set of
coveralls, and a cap, and takes them to Laura.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the coveralls)
            You put this on.

                      LAURA
                 (groggily)
            ...what...?

                      SCOTT
            You...

A pause. He turns to the sound of a car.

ANGLE HIS POV. A car, on the tarmac. It comes to a stop by a
private plane. Beyond this private plane, we see the "Global
News" bizjet, being directed to a stop.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he watches the tarmac.

ANGLE HIS POV. Stoddard and several of his men, get out of
the car which has stopped by the private plane. A man in
fatigues emerges from the plane, and hands Stoddard a piece
of paper. Stoddard begins giving this man directions.

ANGLE INT. THE CARGO HANGAR. Scott and Laura, who now has on
the mechanics coveralls.

                                                         127.


ANGLE Scott, as he looks out of the hangar door. To his
right, the plane with Stoddard and his men, to his left, the
"Global News" bizjet, its hatchway staircase, just descending.

ANGLE on Scott, as he looks at his watch. He turns to Laura.

                      SCOTT
            A little walk-in-the-park.
                 (he points her to the
                 News jet)
            See there...?

ANGLE EXT. THE NEWS BIZJET. Where a man in a safari jacket,
and a woman emerge from the plane, and glare at the sun. We
see this man consult his watch.

ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, as he walks her out of the hangar,
and towards the news bizjet. In the B.G. We see Stoddard,
and his men, at their plane. Another car pulls up to
Stoddard, disgorging a man, who goes to conference with
Stoddard.

ANGLE, these two men.

                      SECOND MAN
                 (giving his report)
            ...all of the passenger terminals,
            and all access-points to the
            Cargo and General Aviation...

                      LAURA
                 (groggily, as in a dream)
            No, you know what my mistake was...?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks around)
            ...what was that...?

He stops and picks up a pair of "paddles" from their
position, leaning against the nose wheel of a plane. They
walk on. In the BG we see Stoddard and his crew, searching.

                      SCOTT
            ...what was your mistake...?

                      LAURA
                 (from a distance, as
                 she begins to laugh,
                 as at a great private
                 joke; she stops walking)
            ...you think we bring our
            troubles on ourselves...?

                                                            128.


                      SCOTT
            I'm certain of it.

She starts laughing, getting hysterical.

                      SCOTT
            No, no...come on baby...come on,
            come on girl: just walk to the
            plane: Just Get On the
            Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...

She starts to break free and Scott manoeuvres her into a
small hangar area. She is struggling mightily. Scott has his
hand over her mouth.

ANGLE. We see their feet moving through a pool of oil on the
concrete floor - we see she loses her footing. We see Scott
tighten his grip on her, and is furiously trying to calm her.

                       SCOTT
            Shussh, baby... shussh...
            shussh... it's going to be
            alright...

We see him work a small hypodermic kit from the pocket of
his jacket. We see Laura see it, and her eyes grow wide.

                      SCOTT
            This's going to make Everything
            Allright...

Laura reacts to the hypodermic, which Scott is bringing
toward her. And screams.

                        LAURA
            No!

EXT. THE HANGAR AREA.

We see Stoddard, and his men, about to get into their Jeep,
stop, and turn at the sound.

ANGLE INT. The Hangar Area. Signs all over marked in Arabic
and English - "Petrol - No Smoking!!"

As Scott lunges after Laura, the door, behind her bursts
open, and Stoddard and an accomplice enter, placing Laura,
in the midst of the hangar, between Stoddard and Scott. Who
stands in front of a large tanker labelled "Aviation Gasoline".

                                                            129.


                      STODDARD
            Leave her Alone.
                 (to his men)
            Don't shoot him, don't shoot,
            you'll blow the thing sky high...

                         SCOTT
            Laura...

                      STODDARD
            Thank God we Found you. You know
            me. I work for Mister Burch.
            I've met you...

ANGLE on Laura, standing between the two men. She is
completely confused. She looks from one to another.

                      LAURA
                 (drugged and groggy)
            He said that he came to get me...
                 (she shakes her head
                 in disbelief. Then she
                 starts to walk a step
                 toward Scott, then
                 turns, and proceeds
                 toward Stoddard.)


                      STODDARD
            That's right, Laura...Walk away
            from him. Walk to the Plane...He
            can't hurt you now. Walk to the
            plane...

He points at his bizjet, outside, on the tarmac. Laura walks,
unsteadily, in the direction pointed, and we see a female
attendant, in a vaguely military getup, get out of the plane,
and begin to walk toward Laura.

                         SCOTT
                    (screams)
            No...

He starts toward Laura. And Stoddard and his two men
interpose themselves between Scott and Laura, who is
approaching the plane. Stoddard's two men approach Scott.
One draws a knife.

ANGLE on Scott, who hangs his head, wearily. He looks down
at his empty hands.

ANGLE on the man with the knife, approaching him.

                                                           130.


ANGLE on Scott, straightening himself, as if submitting to
the inevitable, as the man with the knife draws closer. He
makes a thrust, and covers. Scott steps toward him and spits
at him, full in the face. The man with the knife recoils for
a moment, and Scott disarms him, throws him viciously to the
concrete floor, and stomps on him. Scott bends to pick up
the knife the man has dropped, and turns to face the other
man. As he does so, he slips on what we see is a large pool
of oil on the floor. He goes down heavily. And the second
man steps into him as he falls, drawing his pistol.

                      STODDARD
            DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, DON'T
            SHOOT HIM IN HERE...

The man uses the pistol to cuff Scott, who is attempting to
rise to his knees, behind the ear. Scott falls.

                      STODDARD
            Cuff 'im...

The man handcuffs Scott behind his back.

ANGLE on Scott shaking his head to clear it, as he now
struggles to his knees.

ANGLE, his POV. Laura Newton, walking toward the bizjet.

                      STODDARD
                 (to Scott)
            Yes...well...

                      SCOTT
            Let the girl go home.
                 (pause)


                      STODDARD
                 (to his henchmen)
            ...wait till she lifts off, take
            him outside and shoot him.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he speaks he moves,
                 slightly, continuously,
                 to get a better view
                 of the girl)
            ...why can't the Girl Go Home?

                      STODDARD (CU)
            Because she's dead.
                 (pause)
            You had to know the Secret
            Knowledge. Didn't you?

                                                         131.


                      SCOTT
            What is the Secret Knowledge?

                      STODDARD
            The Secret Knowledge is: There
            Is No Secret Knowledge.
                 (turns over his
                 shoulder, to look at
                 Laura, walking toward
                 the plane)
            You went Beyond What Was
            Permitted. And the Gods Are Angry.

ANGLE. On the tarmac. Laura, walking toward the plane, the
petroleum storage hangar behind her. We see a vaguely
military uniformed woman fall into step beside her and take
her arm. Laura looks at her. We see Laura full face, and
just the shoulder of the woman escorting her. Beyond them we
hear the engine of the bizjet start up.

                      LAURA
            ...I'm so tired.

                      WOMAN
            ...I'm going to ask you to do
            Just the One More Thing...

Laura looks at her questioningly.

                      WOMAN
            I'm going to ask you, now, to
            walk away from this plane, and
            come with me.

ANGLE, to show that the stewardess, who descended from the
bizjet (the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier)
is still on station outside of the bizjet, and that the
woman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black,
the young female sergeant we met earlier. Laura looks at her
uncomprehendingly. Laura begins shaking her head pathetically,
and protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black.

                      LAURA
            No...leave me alone. No - I don't
            know you...

ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. Day.

                                                            132.


                      STODDARD
                 (to his men, as he,
                 Stoddard, casts a
                 glance outside, and
                 then back)
            Alright, take him outside...
                 (the henchman hoists
                 Scott to his feet)


ANGLE, on Laura and Jackie Black. Standing immobile. Laura
looks down at something. She then looks up, her face transfixed.

ANGLE, on Jackie Black's hands, she holds the cheap jewelry
box we saw earlier, and, in it. The photo of Laura and Donny,
and the legend: "Donny you can keep this box, cause I will
never take them off."

ANGLE XCU, on Laura, as she looks at Jackie, who now moves
Laura away from the bizjet, and towards the assemblage of
newspeople, who are on the tarmac, around the "global news" jet.

ANGLE, EXT. The Global News Jet. A female reporter,
gossiping, with some of her crew, looks over in the
direction of Laura and Jackie, and does a double-take.

                      FEMALE REPORTER
            Oh, my God...

ANGLE, on Stoddard, his man, and Scott. As they leave the
hangar. Stoddard looks around.

ANGLE, his POV. Inside the hangar, the fallen man, that
Scott has killed. Stoddard goes back inside, to drag this
man away. He looks up. And, as he does so, he sees Laura,
walking with Jackie Black, toward the Global News Plane.

                      STODDARD
                 (yells)
            Wait...!

ANGLE, on Jackie Black and Laura, walking toward the plane,
where we see the crew hurriedly setting up a camera.

ANGLE, on Stoddard, as he draws his pistol, and fires toward
Laura and Jackie. We see Jackie move to shield Laura, and
then, struck by a bullet, she goes down.

                      JACKIE BLACK
                 (to Laura)
            Keep walking...

ANGLE, on Scott, in the grip of Stoddard's henchman.

                                                         133.


                      HENCHMAN
                 (to Stoddard)
            ...do you want me to...?

In the moment he is distracted. Scott breaks the man's grip,
and his arm. He knees the man, and kicks him to the ground.

ANGLE, INT. The Global Jet. The news crew reacts to the shot.
Beyond them we see Jackie, fallen to the tarmac, and Laura,
is walking toward the newspeople.

                      FEMALE REPORTER
            Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink...
            GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...

Inside the jet we see various monitors, and one switches
from an innocuous travelogue, to the scene at the airport,
and the caption "Live". We see the shot is taken from inside
the plane. We see Laura stumbling toward the bizjet, and see
the female reporter run out of the plane, and move her to
safety inside the cabin.

                      FEMALE REPORTER
                 (to the unseen cameraman)
            On her. On her, get it on the
            girl...Get us Out of Here...

The camera shifts to the image of Laura Newton, going out
live. Behind her we hear the crew shooting commands, and see
the door to the Global jet close, as the jet begins to taxi.

ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. We see Stoddard, reloading
his pistol. In the BG we see Scott step through his
handcuffs, that is, bring them in front of his body. He
takes a pistol from the henchman, who is writing on the
floor. He raises the pistol and shoots the henchman. He
turns on Stoddard.

                      SCOTT
            The girl ain't dead, baby, you're
            dead. You see: that's the
            difference.

He walks toward Stoddard,who is fumbling, trying to reload
his pistol.

                      STODDARD
            WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You
            brought her home. Now, listen to
            me, because I am going to tell
            you...now, you wanted to be
            "inside"...I am going to take
            you as far inside as you can go:
            Z'at what you want...? Is that
            what you want?

                                                            134.


                       SCOTT
            No, I just wanted to bring the
            girl back.

He shoots Stoddard, who falls.

ANGLE, INT. The Bizjet, as it taxis. Laura Newton turns her
face to the sound of the shot.

ANGLE, her POV. Jackie Black, on the tarmac, Scott, kneeling
to the fallen Stoddard, and then running out of the hangar
toward her.

ANGLE, on Scott, running, as we see he has the key he has
taken from Stoddard, and is releasing his handcuffs.

ANGLE Jackie Black, bleeding, as Scott kneels to her, and
cradles her. Scott looks down. Black is weakening, and
obviously expiring.

                      JACKIE BLACK
            ...is she safe?

                      SCOTT
            That's right, she's safe.

                      JACKIE BLACK
                 (weakly, almost whispering)
            ...well, then...

ANGLE on Scott, cradling her. Weeping, as he smoothes her hair.

                      SCOTT
            ...that's right, Baby...


FADE OUT.

          RED TITLES ON BLACK. The sound of a young MAX and WOMAN
          on a WILD CAR RIDE. At the END OF the TITLES, the sound
          of a sudden CAR CRASH, a WHITE INCANDESCENT FLASH of
          light FILLS the SCREEN. THROUGH the BRILLIANT WHITE
          LIGHT we --

          DISSOLVE RAPIDLY TO:

          1 INT. GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER - RIGHT (SEPTEMBER) 1

          Electric' doors zip open. ALEC NEWBERRY, a handsome
          possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate
          LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain-
          smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper,
          dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy
          emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely
          twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are
          in their freshman year of life.
          Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where
          a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze.
          Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS.

                         ALEC
          Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks?
          They were in a car accident?

                         ELECTRIC DOORS
          zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES),
          another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her
          a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by
          her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and
          the Cops.

                         JULES
          They're dead, aren't they?
          Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops.

                         ALEC
          Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with
          Congressman Langston's office.
          Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk.

                         LESLIE
          I think they're okay.

                         JULES
          Thank God.

                         (BEAT)
          Are you aware there's a three-
          hundred-pound man walking around
          naked?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         1 CONTINUED: 1
          WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges
          from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead.

                         HER FRIENDS
          Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you
          all right???

                         WENDY
          I'm fine. It's the car my father
          gave me for graduation that's
          totalled.

                         ALEC

                         (TO KEVIN)
          Find Billy. See if you can sober
          him up.
          Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile,
          Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse.

                         WENDY
          How much do I owe you?

                         JULES
          He almost killed you. Destroyed
          your car, and you're paying...?

                         LESLIE
          Jules, please.
          As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date
          who hovers in the distance.

                         WENDY
          Is that your date?
          The naked man wanders past them.

                         JULES
          No, that's my date!
          As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as
          the Cops approach her.

                         COP # 1
          You pressing charges?

                         WENDY
          No.

                         KI RBO
          'I'm Mr. Hicks' legal counsel and
          he's not required to take any
          tests.

                         (CONTINUED)

                          COP 1
          You're a little late, Counselor.
          He's in the van giving blood right
          now.
          The Cops start toward the electric doors as Kirbo and
          Alec follow. Leslie helps Wendy with the bill. CAMERA
          FINDS Jules whispering dramatically to her Date.

                         JULES
          I'll have to be with her all night.
          They don't know if she's going to
          make it.

                         DATE
          She looks fine.

                         JULES
          Shock. She could black out at any
          second... I'll call you...
          Jules joins Leslie and Wendy.

                         LESLIE
          He's cute.

                         JULES
          Too young... and don't you both
          start on your father complex
          theory.

          2 EXT. MEDICAL CENTER 2

          Alec and Kirbo follow the Cops toward a mobile van.

                         KIRBO
          We're dealing with a first offender
          here, and since Ms. Beamish doesn't
          want to press charges, whaddya say
          we just let this one slide,
          Officers?
          They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see BILLY
          HICKS, a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone,
          wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin,
          who is trying to give him black coffee.

                         COP $1
          Okay, you're under arrest.
          Alec looks to Kevin for information about Billy's
          condition.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2 CONTINUED: 2

                         KEVIN
          I wouldn't strike a match near his
          blood.

                         BILLY

                         (TO COPS)
          Hey, watch my sax...

                         (TO NURSES)
          . You girls believe in premarital
          sax?
          They laugh as Alec barks at him.

                         ALEC
          Billy -- four months after
          graduation and you're still
          acting like every night's a
          fraternity party. Aren't you
          even concerned about Wendy?

                         BILLY

                         (TRUE PANIC)
          Wendy? Jesus, how bad is it?

                         KEVIN
          Severe. She might have finally
          exceeded the limit on her father's
          Visa.
          Billy smiles with relief as the Cops lead him toward
          their car.

                         ALEC
          Will you both get serious. He's
          being arrested for drunk driving.

                         BILLY
          Drunk maybe. But I don't know if
          you could call that driving.
          Wendy, Leslie and Jules come from the hospital, just in

          There is a big COMMOTION at the other and of the hail.

          Young professionals, graduate students, and precocious
          undergrads populate the P.J. Clarke-like bar/restaurant.
          Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables. Alec gets
          rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables
          pushed together. He admonishes WALLY, the burly owner.

          four years.
          Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with
          sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo
          drops off a large pitcher of beer.

                         BILLY
          Hey, I need a real drink.
          Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours.

          Waiters are like cops. Never

          Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a

          Unreachable somewhere in South
          Africa with his new wife, who it
          turns out is only three years older
          than me. And if I don't reach him,
          guess who's going to end up paying
          for that old witch's funeral. Is

          watching a car pull into the parking lot. Dale Biberman
          emerges. Kirbo keeps out of sight, and frantically

          itself. Right near Lockheed.
          Open some wine.

                         KEVIN
          Looks like it could be put
          together with Leggo blocks. You
          design this?

          of our senior architects and I think
          he's going to promote me to the
          design staff.
          Kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener.

                         KEVIN
          Maybe you could design a corkscrew
          that actually works. Everything in
          this apartment comes from Scandinavia.
          They don't even have wine in
          Scandinavia.
          Naturally Leslie opens it in a flash.

                         KEVIN
          Do you think my attachment to Alec
          is unnatural?

                         LESLIE
          No, I think mine is. We've only
          just started to live together and
          he's already pushing for 'the
          wedding.'

                         KEVIN
          Well, since you fell in love with

          night of their lives and not go
          insane?

          They are insane. Wives, husbands,
          children, love, marriage,
          relationship. It's all insane.

                         LESLIE
          That's what I'm afraid of. Did I
          tell you that my perfect sister
          and her perfect husband are getting
          a perfect divorce-?

          you must have been in love with
          somebody, sometime...

                         KEVIN
          Once, in junior high. I played
          guitar in a group and fellin love
          with our singer who did 'We've Only
          Just Begun' as sweet as Karen
          Carpenter. I got high on cheap
          champagne and pledged my love.
          Next day she ran off with the bass
          player named Rocky and I traded my
          guitar in for a battered Underwood
          typewriter.

          substance.

          day you could make a mistake and

          As Jules connects with her number, Alec starts to head
          out of the hotel in disgust. A beautiful older woman is
          getting her key from the desk and crosses in front of him
          toward the elevators. She and Alec check each other out.
          He smiles. She smiles. As her elevator, arrives, she
          changes her mind and, giving Alec an inviting smile,
          steps into the dimly-lit bar. Alec is torn between
          morality and temptation. Temptation wins as he follows
          the sexy lady.

          So, I went to see my boss and I

          presidential like, 'How can I be
          in banking when I can't even
          balance my own checkbook.' But
          instead, he took me to dinner --
          several times.

          of?

                         KIRBO
          Rejection. Total and devastating.
          As long as she hasn't rejected me,
          there's hope.

                         KEVIN
          I have lived with a secret obsession
          many years myself. However, I
          realize the other person has no
          interest in me -- so I pursue my
          career which is going even more
          unsuccessfully.

                         KIRBO
          Who are you in love with?

                         KEVIN

          My underwear is enough. Kirbo, if
          you must pursue this narcissistic
          mortification, that you have decided
          to call love, then you must ask her
          out on a proper date. Like a young
          god. Like Alec, our leader, would.

          You'll go fluff and fold, someday.

          obits. I can't even come up with
          a decent piece for the paper to

          I can't help you with your writer's
          block -- until I see that look in
          Dale Biberman's eyes. The look
          that says she knows I'm the one
          for her.

                         KEVIN

          women you were going out with?

                         KIRBO
          They weren't women. They were

          You'll never catch me making a
          fool ofmyself over a beautiful

          hand in the vault. I become a

          get caught in a sex scandal.
          Retire in massive disgrace -- but
          write a huge bestseller and become
          the star of my own talk show.

          Well, it turned out that cremation
          is almost as expensive as the non-

                         KIRBO
          I'm going to be a doctor.

                         DALE
          That's not what's going on.
          They pull up in front of her building and get out of the
          car.

                         KIRBO
          Why did you tell me you had to
          work tonight? Why did you lie?

                         DALE
          I didn't want to hurt your
          feelings.

                         KIRBO
          I'm obsessed with you, Dale. I
          have been for four years.

                         DALE
          But you don't even know me.

                         KIRBO
          I know. But I'm obsessed by my
          fantasy of you.
          Dale realizes this man needs some help.

          94 INT. DALE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) 94

           Kirbo is actually entering Dale's apartment. A shrine.

                         DALE
          I'm very average... full of
          flaws...
          She gestures toward her sloppy bedroom.

                         DALE
          I'm a slob.., can't even make a
          bed straight... You ready for
          more...

          garbage bag.

          out her own garbage.
          She opens the apartment door as her roommate, JUDITH,
          arrives home with a bad cold.

                         DALE
          Here's my roommate, Judith. She
          hates me.

                         JUDITH
          I hate her.
          Judith disappears into the bedroom as Dale puts out the
          garbage. Kirbo sits for a moment alone, stunned. Dale
          returns.

                         DALE
          And here's the worst of all...
          When I first decided to be a
          doctor, I thought it was because
          I wanted to serve people. But
          now, well, I'm beginning to get
          this funny feeling that what
          medicine's really all about is
          money... You want some coffee?

                         MIRBO
          It's money, isn't it? That's what
          you're trying to tell me. It's
          'cause I don't have any money!
          Thank you for being so honest.
          He gets up and leaves.

          95 EXT. GEORGETOWN CAMPUS - DAY 95

          CLOSE ON Billy as he walks across the campus and even-
          tually stops.

          96 HIS POV - HIS OLD FRATERNITY HOUSE 96
          A few young men stop their activities when they see
          Billy. Others join. TROY, an undergrad big shot,
          arrives.

                         TROY
          The man. The myth. The legend.
          The one and only Billy the Kid!
          The guys all cheer as they surround Billy.

          97 EXT. CAMPUS - DAY (LATER) 97

          Billy plays football with the younger students. He
          seems happy and home at last. As the others run toward
          the opposite side of the grounds, Billy looks to Troy.

                         TROY
          Like old times, Billy-Boy.

                         BILLY

          job maybe on campus... you know
          work with the students or the
          fraternity. Maybe coaching or
          something.

                         TROY
          We could use somebody like you
          around, Billy.

                         BILLY

                         (ENCOURAGED)
          Really?

                         TROY
          Yeah. We need somebody to get us
          some good drugs.
          Billy realizes there is no place for him here either.
          He looks up to see Felicia and the baby. He gives the
          football to Troy and slowly walks across the field.

                         BILLY
          Hi, babe...
          There is a long pause.

                         FELICIA
          He came to see me, Billy, and he
          still wants to marry me. And held
          take good care of Melody and I
          could probably get an annulment.

          But I'll get the right job soon.
          I'll change... I swear it. No

          KIM SUNG HO
          I work out of my house. You must
          be available twenty-four hours a
          day. Complete discretion and
          loyalty. Five hundred dollars a
          week.
          We now see he is talking to Kirbo.

                         KIRBO
          I'm your man, Mr. Ho.

          KIM SUNG HO
          Your scholastic record is very
          impressive, why would you be
          willing to leave law school for
          essentially a gofer's position?

                         KIRBO
          I don't feel it has any relevancy
          in the world I want to go into.

          KIM SUNG HO
          Which world is that?

                         KIRBO
          The 'real' world. Besides, did
          you know that there are more
          students in law school than there
          are practicing lawyers?

          99 EXT. GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER - DUSK 99

          Winter is on the way. Dale gets out of her car. As she
          starts for the hospital, a limousine pulls up. Kirbo is
          sitting in the back.

          attache to Kim Sung Ho. You know,
          the famous Korean entrepreneur?
          He quickly holds up a newspaper with Kim on the cover.

                         DALE
          What about medical school?

                         KIRBO
          I have to grab my huge financial
          opportunities while-I can. It's
          all about money, isn't it, Dale?

                         DALE
          Well, good luck.

                         KIRBO

          night at Kim's house.

          Well, thank you, Kirby. I'll try...
          She smiles sweetly and runs off as Kirbo sits back and
          talks to the female Chauffeur.

                         KI RBO
          She'll be there. You see her
          face when she saw this car?

          Mr. Ho catches you having a party
          in his house Saturday night.
          You'll be out on the street.

                         KIRBO
          He won't be back until Sunday...

          bucks for you and Kenny to shut up.

          SHOTS of party beginning: Alec, Leslie, Wendy and Howie
          arrive. Other guests arrive, including some regulars
          from St. Elmo's, undergrads and old schoolmates. Billy
          enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts.
          Wendy watches him painfully.

                         KEVIN
          holds court for the undergrads.

                         KEVIN
          The best advice I can give you
          undergrads is to fail. Failure is
          a virtue in today's society. Human
          error is a badge of honor. If
          you're the alcoholic child of a
          celebrity, you can blame them and
          earn a year on the best-seller
          list. If you're a celebrity, your
          mistake will earn you a People
          magazine cover. It's post-
          Watergate morality. Take
          responsibility for your mistakes
          and make a quick buck while you're
          at it.

                         E
           distinguished family.

                          KEVIN
          No, that's more effect.
          He opens a straw box, obviously filled with his most
          personal possessions and extricates a photograph of a
          very ordinary family.

                         KEVIN
          You remember my family.

                         LESLIE
          So I've wandered into a real
          woman trap here, haven't I?

                         KEVIN
          Except you're the first woman
          I've ever been able to get up
          here. And I've blown all my
          props already... So how about
          some brandy?
          Kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that
          passes for a kitchen, Leslie finds photos and political
          cartoons in his straw box. Eventually, she finds a
          photo of herself, and then another -- followed by dozens
          more. Kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret
          stash. He comes back with the brandy to find her looking
          at the photos.

                         LESLIE
          Am I part of your props?

                         KEVIN

                         (PAINFULLY; SWEETLY)
          No... you're the real thing.
          He quickly starts pouring the brandy as Leslie looks at
          Kevin, almost for the first time.

          117 EXT. WEST VIRGINIA FREEWAY SIGN - NIGHT 117

           It is starting to snow.

          118 INT. WENDY'S CAR - NIGHT 118

           Kirbo drives frantically. As snowflakes begin to hit
           the windshield, he grabs for the windshield wiper. Not
           knowing how it works, he forces it the wrong way. The
          handle comes off in his hand.

          Alec was the first. There were
          other guys, in high school, boys
          -- but he was the first love of my
          life. I always wondered if Alec
          and I hadn't ended up in the same
          dorm -- well, I guess I would have
          just found someone else. And so
          would he.

                         KEVIN
          Alec had the luck of geography.
          Whatever we say about Alec we'll
          regret tomorrow.

                         LESLIE
          What do you think about our
          relationship. as an outsider?

                         KEVIN
          Oooo -- dangerous question.

                         (BIG SLUG)
          Sometimes I think I just hang
          around with you and Alec 'cause.
          well, since he introduced me to
          you...

                         LESLIE
          Kevin.

                         KEVIN
          And I think the reason I'm not
          interested in other women... is
          'cause I...

                         LESLIE
          (tears of joy)
          Kevin. All this time right in
          front of us. How could I have
          been so blind?

                         KEVIN
          Leslie, we won't even remember
          this tomorrow.

                         S
          It is tomorrow.
          There is a mad moment of hesitation and then Kevin and
          Leslie smash into each other's arms.

                         KEVIN
          I love you... I've always loved
          you.
          They kiss madly, passionately. They fall to the floor
          in a frenzy. Leslie pulls Kevin's hair.

                         KEVIN
          Aaaaah. Ouch...
          (as she stops)
          No. I love it. I love it!!!
          Leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around
          the floor. Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets
          wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he
          yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back
          of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the
          clasp.

                         LESLIE
          No... it's in front.
          With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up
          the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss
          madly again as they roll in the rug.

          126. SHOTS OF CLOTHES ALL OVER THE ROOM 126
          Leslie and Kevin fuck on the floor, on the coffin, in
          the shower. All over the apartment.

          127 EXT. SHOW-COVERED PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - NIGHT 127

          The worst turnpike in the world. Kirbo swerves on the
          slushy lanes. Fortunately he is the only car on the
          road.

          KIRBO (V.0.)
          Dear Mr. Iacoccoa... Recently, in
          a life and death situation, I
          had the bad luck to use one of

          down the middle of the cold, quiet street.

          120 INT. JEEP - HIGHT 120

          Jules, in a fur coat, is driving Billy home. They both
          are moving kind of slow, having had too much of
          everything.

                         JULES
          Which one is yours? I always
          forget.

                         BILLY
          So do I. You wanna go someplace?
          He points to a house. Jules stops the Jeep.

                         JULES
          Do I. I've had a shit day.

                         BILLY
          I've had a shit year.

                         JULES
          Where do you want to go?

                         BILLY
          The bars are all closed. How 'bout
          your place?

                         JULES
          We're going to my place. Good.
          She STARTS up the JEEP.

                         BILLY
          Jules, you've really grown up into
          a fine-looking woman.

                         JULES
          I don't feel very fine-looking.

                         BILLY
          I've been meaning to ask you
          something all night. What do you
          have on under that skirt?

                         JULES

          beautiful lips.
          Jules needs some attention. The hot couple kiss. He
          immediately goes for the gold.

                         JULES
          Billy... enough!

                         BILLY
          Who says?

                         JULES
          I say.

                         BILLY
          Yeah, well, I bet you really won't
          have so much to say with me in
          your mouth.
          He kisses her wildly as she pushes him away aggressively.

                         JULES
          I'm serious, Billy. No!!!
          He grabs the keys from the ignition as the CAR DIES.

                         JULES
          Billy!
          Holding her off with one hand, he shoves the keys into
          his underwear and then sits back grinning.

                         BILLY
          Come and get 'em.

                         JULES
          You shit!!!
          She attacks him, biting his hands, his neck and his
          chest. Billy shrieks with laughter and pain.

          121 EXT. JEEP - NIGHT 121

          He tumbles out of the Jeep, onto the street, laughing and
          shouting. Jules tumbles right after him, belting, pinch-
          ing, biting. As she goes to kick him, Billy slides
          between her legs and looks up under her skirt.

                         BILLY
          Ultimate...

          â¢ She sits down an his chest, undoes his pants and gets her
          keys. Felt up with all, she heads back to the Jeep.

                         JULES
          I really needed you tonight.

                         BILLY
          Nell, just get back in the Jeep
          and assume the missionary
          position.

                         JULES
          You break my heart. You break
          everybody's heart.
          She drives off in the Jeep. Billy fumbles with his pants
          and then turns toward his house. Felicia, holding their
          baby, stands watching from the porch. Obviously having
          seen most of this, she silently goes back into the house,.
          locks the door and turns out the light. Alone, drunk and
          bewildered, Billy starts moving away from the house real-
          izing he has no place to go.

          Kirbo is still driving frantically, but, without the
          windshield wipers, snow is building rapidly on the wind-
          shield.

          123 EXT. CAR - MIGHT 123

          Kirbo, with one hand on the wheel, hangs out of the car
          using his left hand to wipe off the snow. It's cold.

                         KIRBO
          Shit... Goddammitt...

          He rams and jams every button and knob in sight as he
          weaves dangerously on the freeway. Eventually one of the
          levers comes off in his hand.

                         KIRBO

          â¢ Kirbo tries to stop the car in front of a cabin, but
          it slides further than he had planned and almost hits
          it. Getting out and trudging through the snow, in his
          party clothes. he bangs on the door.

          are you?
          The door swings open and there stands GUY, a handsome
          thirty-year-old wrapped in a blanket. Dale comes from
          the bedroom, fastening a man's robe and staring at Kirbo
          in disbelief.

                         DALE
          Kirby? What are you doing here?
          His entire world has collapsed. He can't swear, shout
          or cry -- he can only dash toward the car frantically.
          Falling in the snow once or twice, he eventually jumps
          into the car and tries to peel out, but it just spins
          in the snow. Meanwhile Guy has put on heavy boots and
          comes running out to the car where Kirbo stands on the
          gas to no avail.

                         DALE
          Kirby, stop. Come inside.
          He ignores her maniacally as he keeps desperately trying
          to get out of there.

                         GUY
          You've got no skid chains or snow
          tires. You've got no traction.
          Kirbo ignores them.

          She begins pulling on her boots as Guy tries to reason
          with Kirby.

                         GUY
          People have died out here.

                         KIRBO
          Leave me alone. I'm not your
          responsibility!
          Dale has joined them.

                         DALE
          By driving up here, you've made
          us responsible for you. Now
          come inside.

          129 INT. CABIN - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) 129

          Kirbo sits in front of the fire wrapped in a blanket.
          Guy goes back into the bedroom as Dale finishes making
          a bed for him on the sofa.

                         DALE
          Your clothes should be dry in a
          few hours.

          We'll talk in the morning.
          She joins Guy, in the bedroom and closes the door. Kirbo
          is left with the pajamas and his desperate anguish.

          was always a barometer,'especially,
          at the fraternity. The more women
          you got, the more of a man you
          were... or thought you were... I
          thought I was.

          He starts to get up with her help.

          MR. BEAMISH
          .. Don't judge your mother and
          me so hard... and the way we
          raised you and your sisters.
          There's no training to be a parent,
          you know. You're learning every

          They start back toward the restaurant.

                         WENDY
          There's no training to be me
          either, Dad. I'm learning on

          Leslie enters carrying several empty cardboard boxes.
          She shakes off her many emotions and tries to efficiently
          gather her things. Beginning with record albums, she
          accidentally knocks an ashtray to the floor.

          Shit.
          As she picks up the broken pieces, the door opens from
          the bedroom. Alec appears, looking horrible, in his
          bathrobe.

                         KEVIN
          Forever got a lot shorter suddenly.
          They move on, passing a sign on the door: "WAITER
          WARTED." Kevin points to it.

                         KIRBO
          No, as soon as I get back in
          school, I'm going to work part-
          time for a law firm. Did you know
          there are as many people in law
          school as there are practicing
          lawyers?

                         KEVIN
          Sounds familiar.

                         KIRBO
          How'd she put the rubber on with
          her mouth?

          156 INT. LARGE GLAMOROUS INTERNATIONAL BANKING OFFICES - DAY 156

          A well-dressed female executive secretary looks disturbed
          as she enters a formidable office. She returns with a
          distinguished GENTLEMAN in a grey suit. He approaches
          Leslie who is waiting anxiously.

                         GENTLEMAN
          Yes, may I help you?

                         LESLIE
          I want to see Forrester Davidson
          Jr.

                         GENTLEMAN
          I am Forrester Davidson Jr.
          Leslie is shocked and even more confused.

                         LESLIE
          Well, there must be some mistake.
          I've come to see Julianna van
          Patten and they told me she
          doesn't work here anymore.

          157 INT. SENATOR HODGES' HEADQUARTERS - AFTERNOON (NOVEMBER) 157

          Busy. Active. Alec is on a phone and talking to co-
          workers at the same time. He looks up to see Leslie,
          very shaken, waiting across the room. He is immediately
          angered, but eventually gets off the phone and joins
          her.

                         ALEC
          Did you forget one of your albums?

                         LESLIE
          I'm sorry to bother you here.
          It's Jules. After she left for
          work this morning, the finance
          company came and took away all
          her furniture, her Jeep, everything
          they could get their hands on...
          I couldn't reach her so I finally
          went over to her office. Alec --
          she was fired three weeks ago!
          All this time, she's been
          pretending to go to work every day
          , and pretending to be still
          having this affair with her boss.
          And she's been doing a lot of coke
          .. Well, anyway, I confronted her
          at the apartment, and at first she
          denied everything, but then she
          went crazy -- and now she's locked
          herself in the apartment and she
          won't let me back in... I'm really
          worried about her.
          Alec hesitates angrily.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, please. I need your help.

          Alec knocks on the door with Leslie.

                         ALEC
          Jules, open the door.
          Leslie puts her key in the door.

          159 INT. JULES' APARTMENT - CLOSE ON DOOR - DAY (LATE) 159

           Dead locks and a heavy bolt prevent it from opening.

          â¢ Jules, come on. Just open the
          door.

          160 INT. JULES' APARTMENT 160

          The main room is empty and dark, except for Jules, who
          sits on the floor dressed only in a thin T-shirt and
          bikini pants. Thin, tired, no makeup, this is a differ-
          ent Jules than we have seen before. Freezing winds shoot
          through the open window.

          161 INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY 161


                         ALEC
          Jules, remember my junior year
          when I went cold turkey on
          cigarettes? You sat up with me
          all night in the commons room
          feeding me emergency carrots...?
          No answer.

                         LESLIE
          Jules, if you don't let us in, we're
          going to have to call the police.
          There is a beat and then Jules speaks from the depths of
          hell.

          JULES (O.S.)
          I'll throw myself out the window
          before they get through the door.

                         LESLIE
          Not my greatest ploy.

                         ALEC
          Jules, remember the time I flunked
          art history and I was trying to
          drink myself to death...
          Kevin and Kirbo come dashing up the stairs breathlessly.

                         KIRBO
          How is she?

                         LESLIE
          She just threatened to throw
          herself out the window.
          Kevin and Alec have a moment of awkwardness.

                         LESLIE
          The fire escape!

          Alec, Kevin and Kirbo climb up the fire escape. They
          arrive at the second floor to find burglar proof grill-
          work locked in place, but the windows are still wide open.

          Through the iron bars they see Jules.

                          ALEC
           Jules, what are you doing? You'll
           freeze...
           He stops.

                          KEVI N
           To death. Exactly!
           The three young men start tearing at the bars frantically.

          165 INT. HALLWAY 165

          Leslie pounds on the door.

                         LESLIE
          Jules, you're really scaring me
          now.

          166 EXT. JULES' FIRE ESCAPE - LATE AFTERNOON 166

          Alec, Kevin and Kirbo cannot budge the bars.

                         KEVIN
          The whole country is.falling apart,
          but these five bars are made
          perfectly.

                         ALEC
          We need something that cuts
          through metal.

                         KEVIN
          Or an experienced thief.

                         KIRBO
          I'll find Billy.
          Kirbo dashes down the fire escape.

                         KEVIN
          I was kidding.

          Billy's working at the big Chevron
          station on Michigan. He must have
          a hacksaw or something...
          Kirbo takes off on his bike as Alec looks at Kevin.

                         ALEC
          Billy is working in a gas
          station???

                         KEVIN
          He needed the money.
          Suddenly, Alec and Kevin become aware that they are
          alone.

                         ALEC
          I saw your article.

                         KEVIN
          Yeah, well, yesterday's editorial
          achievement is today's garbage
          wrapper, right...?
          Kevin tries to laugh charmingly. Alec tries to laugh
          along with him, but suddenly rage returns.

                         ALEC
          You little shit!!!
          He grabs Kevin. Kevin tries to fight back, but Alec is
          so overpowering he pushes Kevin up to the railing of the
          fire escape, and then pushes him over. Kevin hangs
          upside down as Alec holds him by his legs. Dozens of
          scraps of paper fall from his pocket.
          Leaning out the apartment hallway window, Leslie sees
          them.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, no!!!

          Leslie runs screaming through the hall and down the
          stairs, passing Ron Dellassandro who is just coming home
          from work.

                         RON
          What's happening???

           Kevin, still hanging upside down, tries to hang on to
           Alec. Papers continue to fly.

                          KEVIN
           My notes!

                          ALEC
          You won't need any more notes on
          the meaning of life.

                         KEVIN
          (upside-down,

                         STRAINING)
          I'm kinda betting on you not doing
          it, Al... think of your political
          career.
          Leslie runs into the alley underneath them.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, stop Iit!
          She frantically starts climbing the fire escape.

          I feel I've done a lot for you,
          too, Al... so pull me up and we'll
          call it even.

                         ALEC
          What you did for me was take the
          woman I was going to marry.
          The woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto
          their landing. She struggles with Alec.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, stop it right now!
          Below them, Billy and Kirbo pull up in a Chevron tow
          truck. Billy, wearing Chevron coveralls, jumps out with
          an acetylene torch in hand, shouting.

                         BILLY
          Looks pretty ultimate up there...

          You think this is helping Jules?
          With Kevin's life still in his hands, he suddenly
          remembers Jules.

          Are you all right?
          Kirbo tries to get the dolly up the fire escape with
          Billy.

                         KIRBO
          Hey! Help.
          Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec
          and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her
          hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules.

                         LESLIE
          Oh, my God. Jules, please, it's
          so cold.

          Very noble how you ran up here to
          save your lover.

          Bullshit.

          Hang on, Jules. We all love you.
          She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands,
          but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her
          hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her
          hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath
          onto them. Much emotion passes between them.

                         LESLIE
          Your breath, your breath is so
          sweet.

          ALEC.
          Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm so
          profoundly sorry.
          Kirbo and Kevin arrive. Billy races down the alley.

                         KIRBO
          Blowtorch, anyone?

                         ALEC
          Give it to me.

                         KEVIN
          Do not hand him a blowtorch!
          Kevin takes the torch and goes for the bars. SPARKS and
          fire fly. Suddenly there is a PHENOMENAL POUNDING from
          inside the apartment at Jules' front door. It stops
          everyone on the fire escape.

                         BILLY
          When I realized how insane I've
          been all this time tryin' to be
          like Alec and Leslie... and you
          and Kevin... I'm not part of this
          post-college Georgetown life;
          marriage and jobs. Felicia and
          Melody'll be better off without me.

                         WENDY
          Did she get remarried already?

                         BILLY
          Three or four weeks...

          I was thinkin' of hanging around
          tryin'to be one of those in-the-
          neighborhood dads... but it would
          just confuse everybody... especially
          me. New York'll suit me fine. if
          somebody'll let me play sax.

                         (INDICATING APARTMENT)
          This is great.

                         WENDY
          I'll tell you what's great. Last
          night I woke up in the middle of
          the night and made myself a peanut
          butter and jelly sandwich... and
          you know it was my kitchen, and
          my refrigerator and My apartment
          . and it was the best peanut
          butter and jelly sandwich I've
          ever had in my life.
          They chuckle together and then they become more serious.

                         WENDY
          So you're goin', huh...?
          She picks up his sax and blows a few comic notes.

                         BILLY
          So, are you still a virgin?

                         WENDY
          Why is my sexual status so
          important to you?

                         BILLY
          Have I abused our relationship too
          much? Or could I be so bold... as
          to ask you for a going-away present...?
          Wendy is moved.

          Lying on the floor of her bedroom. Only a candle lights
          the room. Billy's face comes INTO FRAME and they kiss,
          tenderly at first and then more passionately. Wendy
          looks beautiful and she and Billy are filled with a
          tenderness and love that can only exist from the years
          they have shared together.

          181 EXT. BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT 181

          A large bus pulls out as Leslie stands at a coffee
          vending machine. Alec approaches.

                         ALEC
          Need someone to blow on your hands?
          She smiles, but shows him her gloves. As she searches
          for change in her pockets, Alec stops her and puts his
          own coins in the machine. He presses buttons as he
          talks.

                         ALEC
          Did you know that I.always wanted
          to make you coffee? I tried once
          -- when you were in the shower --
          but it didn't turn out right, so I
          threw it out and cleaned everything
          up so you wouldn't know. I don't
          like doing things I'm not good at
          -- like making coffee and saying
          I'm sorry...
          He looks at her sincerely as he hands her the plastic cup
          from the machine.

                         ALEC
          Leslie, I'm sorry.
          They exchange a tender glance, and then Leslie takes a
          sip from the steaming cup.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, this is soup.

                         ALEC
          What?

                         LESLIE
          This is soup.
          Alec's nervousness turns to embarrassment as they both
          start to laugh. Old feelings surge.

                         LESLIE
          I love you.
          They look at each other for a moment.

                         LESLIE
          We need time.

                         ALEC
          I know.

          'Bye, baby.
          She hugs him expansively. Billy next kisses Leslie and
          shakes hands with the guys at the same time. Wendy waits
          until last and then they embrace emotionally.

          Billy smiles at her as she fights tears.

                         BILLY
          I'll keep in touch.

          No, you won't.
          He wants to say more to all of them, but the bus is wait-
          ing and he hops on it. The door closes and the bus backs
          out of the terminal. Billy stands near the driver and
          waves out at them.

                         HIS FRIENDS
          watch him pull away.

                         BUS
          As it pulls backward, we can see Billy with his friend's
          reflections on the bus's windshield SUPERIMPOSED OVER his.

FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

                     SENATOR 1
          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose
          this important source of dilithium.
          A trade agreement is in the best
          interests of the Empire.

                     SENATOR 2
          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
          diplomatic mission to Celes II to
          open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

                     PRAETOR
          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
          the motion.

                     TAL'AURA
          No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
          is to be advised.  I support all
          "diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
          will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
          appointment with the Tholian
          ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

                     PRAETOR
          Then I will call for a vote on the
          motion to open trade negotiations
          with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

                     PRAETOR
          Would someone please tell me what
          that was?
               (he turns to a guard)
          Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

                     PRAETOR
          -- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

                     PICARD
          Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

                     PICARD
          A starship captain's life is filled
          with solemn duty.  I have commanded
          men in battle.  I have negotiated
          peace treaties between implacable
          enemies.  I have represented the
          Federation in first contact with
          twenty-seven alien species.  But
          none of this compares to my solemn
          duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

                     PICARD
          Now, I know that on an occasion
          such as this: it is expected that I
          be gracious and fulsome with praise
          on the wonders of this blessed
          union... But have you two
          considered what you're doing to?
          This is all a damned
          inconvenience...
               (laughter from the crowd)
          While you're happily settling in on
          the Titan, I'll have to train a new
          first officer; no doubt a stern
          martinet who'll quote the rule book
          at me and never... ever... allow me
          to go on away missions.
               (laughter)
          ... Then there's the matter of my
          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
          be probing into my darkest psyche
          as she nods her head and coos
          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
          Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

                     PICARD
          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
          with the rest of you.  As most of
          you know, the doctor will also soon
          be leaving the Enterprise, to
          assume command of Starfleet
          Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
          Beverly, have you considered what
          you're doing to little ole' me?!
          I'll probably get some old battle-
          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
          eat my vegetables and put me on
          report if I don't show up for my
          physical on time!

                     BEVERLY
          It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

                     PICARD
          Really, it's not too late to
          reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

                     PICARD
          Will Riker, you have been my
          trusted right arm for fourteen
          years; you have helped keep my
          course true and steady.  Deanna
          Troi, you have been my conscience
          and best guide, the touchstone to
          the better parts of myself.  You
          are my family.  And in proper
          maritime tradition I wish you full
          sails and a clear horizon... My
          friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

                     BEVERLY
               (playfully)
          Sort of like losing a son and
          gaining an empath, isn't it?

                     PICARD
          Please, Beverly, this is hard
          enough.

                     BEVERLY
          If you start tearing up I promise
          to beam you out.  Level one medical
          emergency.  There's no crying in
          Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

                     LEAH
          I've never seen your Captain so
          nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
          in his old age.

                     GEORDI
               (laughs)
          Not likely.  After we installed the
          new Series Four replicators, he
          tried to order his usual tea and
          there was a glitch.  Had us remove
          the whole bunch of them and put the
          old ones back in.

                     LEAH
          There!  Nostalgic about old
          replicators.

                     GEORDI
          He just likes things the way he
          likes them...
               (he looks at her, smiles)
          Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

                     WORF
          Romulan ale should be illegal.

                     GEORDI
          It is, old chum.

                     WORF
          Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

                     DEANNA
          Really, Captain, it was a lovely
          toast.

                     PICARD
          The least I could do for you,
          Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
          I'm a talking head.

                     DEANNA
          And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
          your new counselor on everything
          she needs to know.

                     PICARD
          The hell you will.  You know too
          much about me as it is... Now you
          promised there are no speeches
          during the ceremony on Betazed.

                     RIKER
          No, no speeches.  No clothes
          either.
               (winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

                     DATA
          Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
          Tran gendered species... In my
          study of Terran and Betazoid
          conjugal rites I have discovered it
          is traditional to present the
          "happy couple" with a gift.  Given
          Commander Riker's affection for
          archaic musical forms I have
          elected to present the following as
          my gift in honor of their
          conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

                     DATA
          If you please, Mister Band Leader,
          a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

                     DATA
               (sings)
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see.  Blue
          birds, singing a song, Nothing but
          blue birds all day long.  Never saw
          the sun shining so bright, Never
          saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

                     WORF
               (groans)
          Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

                     DEANNA
               (smiles)
          All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          May I have this dance?

                     DEANNA
          With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

                     BEVERLY
          Commander Worf... Do Klingons
          swing?

                     WORF
          I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

                     BEVERLY
          Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

                     BEVERLY
          I'm so glad you made it back to the
          Enterprise before I left.

                     WORF
          I was not suited for the life of
          a... diplomat.

                     BEVERLY
               (wry)
          Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

                     PICARD
          I've been saving this.  Chateau
          Picard 2267.  Batten down the
          hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

                     PICARD
          They say a vintner's history is in
          every glass.  The soil he came
          from.  His past as well as his
          hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

                     PICARD
          So... To happy endings.

                     DATA
          To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

                     DATA
          Sir.  I noticed an interesting
          confluence of emotion at the
          wedding.  I am familiar with the
          human concept of tears through
          laughter and its inverse, laughter
          through tears, but I could not help
          wondering about the human capacity
          for expressing both pleasure and
          sadness simultaneously.

                     PICARD
          I understand why it would seem
          confusing.  Certain human rituals --
          like weddings, birthdays or
          funerals evoke strong and very
          complex emotions.  These rites
          carry great weight with us because
          they denote the passage of time.

                     DATA
          And you were particularly aware of
          this feeling because Commander
          Riker will be leaving to assume
          command of the Titan?

                     PICARD
          Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
          Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
          Medical...

                     DATA
          And this makes you "sad"?

                     PICARD
          Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
          I'm very happy for them, of course,
          but I'm going to miss them.  The
          ship will seem... incomplete
          without them.

                     DATA
          That is because you have a
          familiarity with them.  You can
          predict specific reactions and
          behavior and are comfortable in
          that knowledge.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
          well.  They've made important
          choices; they're going to have
          great challenges ahead of them.
          New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          Seeing Will and Deanna today made
          me think about some of the choices
          I've made in my own life.  Devoting
          myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
          or having children... All the
          choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

                     DATA
          The choices I made have led me here
          as well.  This is the only home I
          have ever known.  I cannot foresee
          a reason for leaving.

                     PICARD
          You never know what's over the
          horizon, Data.  Before too long
          you'll be offered a command of your
          own.  Data looks at him; he has
          never really considered this.

                     DATA
          If I were... I believe my memory
          engrams would sense the absence of
          your specific reactions and
          behavior.  I would "miss you."

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Now, you make a toast.

                     DATA
          To new worlds...

                     PICARD
          New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
          worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

                     SURAN
          The fleet commanders are nervous.
          They've agreed to remain at their
          given coordinates and await his
          orders.  But they're anxious to
          know what's going on here.

                     DONATRA
          I don't blame them.  We can't keep
          them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

                     VICEROY (V.O.)
          But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

                     VICEROY
          Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Consider it  The great symbol of
          the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
          holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
          Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Yet for generations one of those
          planets has been without a voice.
          We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
          the disposition of the fleet?

                     SURAN
          They're holding position.

                     SHINZON
          And?

                     SURAN
               (bows his head)
          They will obey, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          It's imperative we retain their
          allegiance or our great mission
          will be strangled before it can
          truly draw breath.

                     DONATRA
          They support your intentions, sir.
          But they require evidence of
          your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

                     SHINZON
          And they'll have it.
               (he begins to pace over
                the star chart)
          Tell the fleet that the days of
          negotiation and diplomacy are over.
          The Almighty Federation will fall
          before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          The time we have dreamed of is at
          hand.  The time... of conquest.
               (sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Cut off the dragon's head and it
          cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

                     SURAN
          How many Warbirds will you need?

                     SHINZON
          None.

They look at him, stunned.

                     SURAN
          Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
          at your disposal.  They supported
          the coup, they'll follow you.

                     SHINZON
          The Scimitar will serve my needs.

                     SURAN
          But surely --

                     SHINZON
          I came this far alone...
               (he looks at his Reman
                warriors)
          We came this far alone.  We require
          no assistance from the fleet.  Now
          leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Are we prepared?

                     VICEROY
          Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          So many years for this moment.
               (he looks up at his
                Viceroy, smiles)
          Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          I won't do it.

                     DEANNA
          It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
          people should appreciate that!
               (whispers)
          Besides, I've already seen it.

                     WORF
          A warrior does not appear without
          his clothing.  It leaves him...
          vulnerable.

                     RIKER
          I don't think we're going to see
          much combat on Betazed.

                     DEANNA
          Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
          there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

                     WORF
          I won't do it.

                     PICARD
          Won't do what, Mister Worf?

                     WORF
          Captain.  I think it is
          inappropriate for a Starfleet
          officer to appear...
               (hates the word)
          ... naked.

                     PICARD
          Come now, a big, strapping fellow
          like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

                     WORF
          I'm picking up an unusual
          electromagnetic signature from the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

                     WORF
          Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

                     GEORDI
          It's very faint but I've isolated
          it to the third planet in the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the planet?

                     GEORDI
          Uncharted.  We'll have to get
          closer for a more detailed scan.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Theories?

                     DATA
          Since positronic signatures have
          only been known to emanate from
          androids such as myself, it is
          logical to theorize that there is
          an android such as myself on
          Kolarus III.

                     GEORDI
          How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

                     DATA
          I thought only me, myself and Lore.

                     RIKER
               (looking at star chart)
          Diverting to the Kolarin system
          takes us awfully close to the
          Romulan Neutral Zone.

                     PICARD
               (looking at star chart)
          Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

                     PICARD
          I think it's worth a look.  Don't
          worry, Number One, we'll get you to
          Betazed with time to spare.

                     RIKER
          Thank you, sir...

                     PICARD
               (to all, especially Worf)
          Where we will all honor the
          Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
          or any other parts of our anatomy.
          Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
          in the gym.

He goes.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm Officer)
          Mister Branson, set course for the
          Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
               (Deanna shoots him a
                glance)
          -- Warp Seven.

                     HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
          Plotted and laid in, sir.

                     RIKER
          Engage.

                     DEANNA
          You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

                     GEORDI
          What do you think, Data, a long-
          lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

                     GEORDI
          I read six distinct positronic
          signatures, spread out over a few
          kilometers on the surface.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the
          population?

                     DATA
          Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
          appears to be a pre-warp
          civilization at an early stage of
          industrial development.

                     GEORDI
          Captain, I don't recommend
          transporting, that ion storm
          doesn't look very neighborly.  It
          could head this way without much
          warning.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
          with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

                     RIKER
               (stands, protesting)
          Captain, I hope I don't have to
          remind you --

                     PICARD
          I appreciate your concern, Number
          One, but I've been itching to try
          out the Argo.

                     RIKER
          Sir --

                     PICARD
          Captain's prerogative, Will.
          There's no foreseeable danger...
          and your wife would never forgive
          me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

                     PICARD
          You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

                     DATA
          The closest signature is two
          kilometers to the west... that
          direction, sir.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Data.
               (he smiles)
          Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

                     DATA
          I will always be baffled by the
          human predilection for piloting
          vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

                     DATA
               (monitoring with
                tricorder)
          Over that rise, sir... half a
          kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

                     DATA
          It appears to be...
               (he scans with his
                tricorder)
          ... an arm.

                     WORF
               (suspicious)
          Why is it moving?

                     DATA
          Like me, it has been designed with
          modular power sources.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

                     DATA
          The next signature is one kilometer
          to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

                     DATA
          The final signature is
          approximately 300 meters up that
          incline.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

                     WORF
               (uneasy)
          To find the head, sir?

                     PICARD
               (amused)
          If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

                     DATA
          Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

                     DATA
          I think it unlikely you will need
          your phaser to recover the cranial
          unit.  Of course, it could bite
          you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

                     WORF
          It's you.

                     DATA
          The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

                     HEAD
          Why am I looking at me?

                     DATA
          You are not looking at yourself.
          You are looking at me.

                     HEAD
               (looking at Worf)
          You do not look like me.

                     WORF
          No.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          I would like to pick you up now.
          May I do that?

                     HEAD
               (to Worf)
          You have a pretty shirt.

                     WORF
          Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

                     DATA
          Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

                     HEAD
          I have two arms and ten fingers.
          Do you know where my arms are?  I
          cannot see where we are going.
          Where are we going?
               (Etc... like Threepio in
                "Empire" when he's
                strapped to Chewbacca's
                back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

                     DATA
          Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

                     WORF
          STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT./ EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

                     WORF
          If you wouldn't mind.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

                     HEAD
          You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

                     DATA
          He is very observant.

                     PICARD
          I can see that.

                      WORF
          Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Shall we try some "unsafe
          velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

                     HEAD
               (to Picard)
          You have a red shirt.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          This is not an appropriate time for
          a conversation.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because the captain has to
          concentrate on piloting the
          vehicle.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Data!

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

                     PICARD
          Mister Data.  Let's make like the
          wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

                     WORF
               (smiles)
          He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

                     BEVERLY
          I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

                     DATA
          Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

                     RIKER
          Geordi?

                     GEORDI
               (at work analyzing the
                torso section)
          Well, he seems to have the same
          internal mechanics as Data but not
          as much positronic development.
          The neural pathways aren't nearly
          as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
          prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
          created before Data.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          Do you have a name, sir?

                     HEAD
          I am the B-9.

                     PICARD
          Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
          whimsical names seems to have no
          end.

                     HEAD
               (to Riker)
          You have a fuzzy face.

                     PICARD
               (trying to ignore the
                head)
          Keep me informed, Number One, and,
          please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

                     DATA
          Can you tell me how you came to be
          on the planet where we found you?

                     B-9
               (blandly)
          I was taken from my homeworld by
          people called the "PakJeds." They
          are fat.  They traded me to a ship
          belonging to the "Bolians." The
          "Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
          a seat and asked me questions.
          Then they were attacked by another
          ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

                     B-9
          Then people called the
          Delviciansans picked me up.  They
          have long teeth.  They asked if I
          do anything to help them.  I told
          them I could do whatever they
          wanted.  They asked me to clean out
          the matrix manifolds.  I told them
          I did not know what an Matrix
          manifold looks like.

                     BEVERLY
          Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
          to run on some medical scanner
          things.

She quickly exits.

                     B-9
          And after they showed me the
          "engine manifolds." Then they
          showed me something called a
          "plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

                     B-9
          ... then the "Cardassians" put me
          into something called a "garbage
          chute" and I went out into space
          again --

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
          the tactical manifests ready, sir.

                     RIKER
               (quickly tapping his comm
                badge)
          Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
          there!...
               (he stands)
          Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

                     B-9
          Fuzzy face is gone.

                     DATA
          Yes, please continue.

                     B-9
          I was in space for a long time.
          Then a ship belonging to the
          "Talosians" picked me up.  They
          asked me where I came from.  I told
          them people called the "Pakleds"
          took me from my homeworld.  They
          are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

                     B-9
          Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

                     DATA
          Do you know who I am?

                     B-9
          You are me.

                     DATA
          No.  My name is Data... I am your
          brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

                     DEANNA
               (to Worf)
          ... and after the ceremony on
          Betazed, three entire weeks for our
          honeymoon.

                     RIKER
          We're going sailing on the Opal
          Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
          solar catamaran.  Just us and the
          sun and the waves.

                     WORF
          It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

                     DEANNA
               (amused)
          It's meant to be relaxing.

                     WORF
          A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
          Kholamar desert march where the
          couple bonds in endurance trials.
          If they survive the challenge they
          move on to the Fire Caves of
          Fek'lhr to face the demons of
          Gre'thor.

                     RIKER
          Well, that sounds relaxing too.

                     WORF
          It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

                     RIKER
          So they've got him up and running.

                     WORF
          He's a very unusual android

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

                     PICARD
          Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

                     PICARD
          Come.
               (Deanna enters)
          Counselor.

                     DEANNA
          Do you have a moment, sir?

                     PICARD
          Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

                     DEANNA
          It's about Data  I've watched him
          with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
          Data's desire for a "family" is
          very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
          investing too much in the B-9.

                     PICARD
          You're speaking of emotional
          investment?

                     DEANNA
          The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
          And Data, in his own way, has
          assumed the position of a parent or
          guardian.  I'm afraid he has
          expectations based on his own
          experiences.  He'll be disappointed
          when the B-9 cannot meet those
          expectations.

                     PICARD
          As much as we care for him,
          Deanna... we have to remember that
          Data isn't capable of
          disappointment.

                     DEANNA
          I don't believe that, sir.  We've
          shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          I'm going to miss you.

                     DEANNA
          And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

                     RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
          communication from Starfleet
          Command.

                     PICARD
          Acknowledged...
               (Deanna stands)
          ... I'll talk to Data

                     DEANNA
          Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

                     PICARD
          Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
          to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          With or without the rest of the
          fleet?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          A diplomatic mission.  We've been
          invited, believe it or not.  Seems
          there's been some kind of internal
          political shakeup.  The new
          Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
          has requested a Federation envoy.

                     PICARD
          New Praetor?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          There's more... as always.  He's
          Reman.
               (Picard is surprised)
          Believe me, we don't understand it
          either.  You're the closest ship so
          I want you to high tail it over
          there and hear what he has to say.
          Get the lay of the land, If the
          Empire becomes unstable, it could
          mean trouble for the entire
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
          Understood.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
          We're sending you all the
          intelligence we have, but it's not
          much.  I don't need to tell you to
          watch your back, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Not with the Romulans.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (smiles wryly)
          The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
          the evil Soran and that pesky
          Nexus.  You seem to get all the
          easy assignments!

                     PICARD
          Just lucky, Admiral.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Let's hope that luck holds.
          Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

                     PICARD
               (to Helm)
          Lay in a new course... Take us to
          Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

                     HELM OFFICER
          Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
          laid in...

                     RIKER
          Romulus?

                     PICARD
          I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
          to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

                     DATA
          As you can see the habitable half
          of Remus is always in darkness
          because, like Mercury, one side
          always faces the sun.  Due to the
          extreme temperatures on that half
          of their world, the Remans live on
          the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

                     DATA
          Almost nothing is known about the
          Reman homeworld, although
          intelligence scans have proven the
          existence of dilithium mining and
          heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

                     DATA
          The Remans themselves are
          considered an undesirable caste in
          the hierarchy of the Empire.

                     RIKER
          But they also have the reputation
          of being formidable warriors.  In
          the Dominion War, Reman forces were
          used as assault troops in the most
          violent encounters.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          Cannon fodder.

                     GEORDI
          Then how did a Reman get to be
          Praetor?  I don't get it.

                     RIKER
          We have to assume he had Romulan
          collaborators.

                     PICARD
          A coup d'etat?

                     RIKER
          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about
          Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

                     DATA
          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

                     DATA
          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

                     DATA
          Do you know the name of the Captain
          of this vessel?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Is that your final answer?

                     GEORDI
               (to B-9)
          Do you know my name?

                     B-9
          You have a soft voice.

                     GEORDI
               (gently)
          Data, he's assimilating a lot of
          programming.  Remember, he's a
          prototype, a lot less sophisticated
          than you are.  We just don't know
          if his matrix will be able to
          adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
          retain anything.  We should give
          him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

                     DATA
          What purpose does this serve?

                     GEORDI
               (also examining circuitry)
          It seems to be a redundant memory
          port.  Maybe it's for provisional
          memory storage in case his neural
          pathways overload?

                     DATA
          Dr. Soong must have found it
          unnecessary in later versions.

                     GEORDI
          It's possible the extra memory port
          is interfering with the engram
          processing.  Mind if I keep him
          here and run some diagnostics?

                     DATA
          No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

                     DATA
          But I believe he will prove
          incapable of performing higher
          functions.

                     GEORDI
          Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
          I know, you're not capable of hope.

                     DATA
               (looking at B-9)
          I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

                     DATA
          No, remain with Commander La Forge.
          He is going to try to make you
          well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
          The Enterprise has arrived at
          Romulus and is waiting at the
          designated coordinates.  All our
          hails have gone unanswered.  We've
          been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

                     RIKER
          Why don't they answer our hails?

                     PICARD
          It's an old psychological strategy,
          Number One.  To put him in a
          position of dominance and make us
          uneasy.

                     RIKER
          It's working.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

                     WORF
          Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

                     PICARD
          Not yet, Mister Worf.

                     RIKER
          Captain, with all due respect to
          diplomatic protocols -- the
          Federation Council's not sitting
          out here, we are.

                     PICARD
          Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
          exacting occupation.  We can wait.

                     DATA
          Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
               (slowly rising from his
                chair)
          My God...

                     WORF
               (tense)
          Should I raise shields?

                     PICARD
          No!

                     WORF
          Captain -- !

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

                     WORF
               (quickly analyzing
                tactical display)
          Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
          seven photon torpedo bays, primary
          and secondary phased shields.

                     RIKER
          She's not out for a pleasure
          cruise.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          She's a predator.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Enterprise.  We are the Reman
          Warbird Scimitar.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I am not Shinzon.  I am his
          Viceroy.  We are sending transport
          coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Not very chatty.

                     PICARD
          Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you'll forgive the
          darkness... we're not comfortable
          in the light.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

                     SHINZON
          Captain Picard... Jean Luc
          Picard... I don't mean to stare,
          it's just -- well, you can't
          imagine how long I've been waiting
          for this moment.  I always imagined
          you taller, isn't that odd?
               (to Data)
          You may scan me without subterfuge,
          Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

                     PICARD
          And you're not as we imagined you.

                     SHINZON
          No?

                     WORF
          You are human.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Worf.
               (he speaks in Klingon)
          I greet you as a valiant warrior...
          and as my brother.

                     WORF
               (terse, in Klingon)
          I'll save my greetings for a better
          brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

                     PICARD
          Why have you asked for our presence
          here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

                     PICARD
          Praetor?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

                     DEANNA
          I'm only half human.

                     SHINZON
          Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
          and telepathic abilities, ship's
          counselor.  All of this I knew...
          But I didn't know you were so
          beautiful.

                     RIKER
          You seem very familiar with our
          personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

                     SHINZON
          I am, Commander Riker...
               (to Deanna)
          ... May I touch your hair?

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
          matter we were -- assured was of
          great importance.  If you have
          anything to say to us as
          representatives of the Federation,
          I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

                     SHINZON
               (softly)
          On the world I come from there's no
          light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
          important.  I see now there's a
          world elsewhere.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
          discuss your lack of a social life.

                     SHINZON
               (turning back to Picard)
          Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
               (he smiles)
          There's so much we have to talk
          about.

                     PICARD
          I would be interested to know what
          we are talking about.

                     SHINZON
          Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
          walls between us to recognize we
          are one people.  Federation and
          Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
          Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
          the thing that makes us the same.
          We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

                     SHINZON
          I want to end the centuries of
          mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
          not your enemy.  As a first step I
          propose we eliminate the Neutral
          Zone and begin a free and open
          exchange of goods and ideas.

                     PICARD
          And the Senate supports you?

                     SHINZON
               (dry)
          I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          Right now, you're thinking this all
          sounds too good to be true?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you're wondering why the
          Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
          the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
          predator?
               (Picard is startled at
                Shinzon's choice of
                words)
          ... But you're also thinking the
          chance for peace is too promising
          to ignore.  Above all, you're
          trying to decide if you can trust
          me.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          Then perhaps the time has come to
          add some illumination to our
          discussion.  Computer, raise
          lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Allow me to tell you a story that I
          hope will clarify my position.
          When I was very young I was
          stricken with an odd disease.  I
          developed a hyper-sensitivity to
          sound.  The slightest whisper
          caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

                     SHINZON
          No one knew what to do.  Finally I
          was taken to a doctor who had some
          experience with Terran illnesses
          and I was finally diagnosed with
          Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
          it, Captain?

                     PICARD
          You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Then you know it's a very rare
          syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
          members of my family had it.
          Eventually I was treated.  Now I
          can hear as well as you can,
          Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

                     SHINZON
          I can see as well as you can.  I
          can feel everything you feel.
               (He stops right before
                Picard)
          In fact, I feel exactly what you
          feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

                     SHINZON
          Do you trust me now?

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We need to talk, just you and I.

                     SHINZON
          Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
          Just the two of us.  Or just the
          one of us.

                     PICARD
          You know I need to verify this.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

                     SHINZON
          Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
          much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

                     PICARD
          Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
          out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

                     BEVERLY
          There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
          down to your regressive strain of
          Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

                     PICARD
          When was he... created?

                     BEVERLY
          About twenty-five years ago.  They
          probably used a hair follicle or
          skin cell.

                     PICARD
               (touching head)
          I think a skin cell's the more
          likely of the two.

                     RIKER
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Believe me, Number One; I'm going
          to find out.  Contact Starfleet
          Command and inform them of the
          situation.  I need to know where
          the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

                     DEANNA
          I would say he's been trained to
          resist telepathy.  What I could
          sense of his emotions were erratic,
          very hard to follow.

                     PICARD
          Is he sincere about wanting peace?

                     DEANNA
          I don't know.
               (she stops him)
          Sir, the strongest sense I had was
          that he's more than curious about
          you.  He very much wants to know
          you.
               (she looks at him deeply)
          The same way you want to know him.

                     PICARD
          How could I not?

                     DEANNA
          Captain, don't assume he's anything
          like you are.  You should resist
          the urge to think you know him.

                     PICARD
          I not only know him, Deanna, I am
          him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

                     DEANNA
          Will, you need to rest.
               (he continues to work)
          As ship's counselor, I'm
          recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

                     RIKER
          Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

                     DEANNA
          We have time.
               (she kisses him)
          Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

                     RIKER
          Imzadi, what am I going to do with
          you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

                     SHINZON
          Imzadi.  This is so good.

                     DEANNA
          No!

He caresses her face...

                     SHINZON
          He can never know you as I know
          you... He can never touch you as I
          touch you.

                     DEANNA
          This isn't real.

                     SHINZON
          Can you feel my hands... are they
          real?  Can you feel my lips, my
          loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

                     SHINZON
          I'll always be with you now.  Now
          and forever...

                     DEANNA
          You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

                     RIKER
          Deanna?!  What's with the name
          calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

                     SURAN
          ... then I don't understand the
          reason for the delay!

                     SHINZON
          You don't have to understand.

                     SURAN
          And bringing the Enterprise here?!
          What possible purpose could that
          serve?!

                     SHINZON
          I have a purpose.

                     SURAN
          Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

                     SHINZON
          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

                     SURAN
               (carefully bows his head)
          Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          Now go.  I have some personal
          business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

                     SHINZON
          Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
          can't stand it.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

                     SHINZON
          It's not quite the face you
          remember.

                     PICARD
          Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

                     SHINZON
          A lifetime of violence will do
          that.  My nose was broken four
          times.  And my jaw... But so much
          is the same.  The eyes, you
          recognize the eyes.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  The eyes have it.

                     SHINZON
          Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
          they?  Yours are so confident.

                     PICARD
          How did you end up on Remus?

                     SHINZON
          They sent me there to die.  How
          could a mere human survive the
          dilithium mines?  It was...
               (he can't find the words)
          ... I was a slave.  And a monster.
          The only thing the Romulan guards
          hated more than the Remans was me.
          But one man took pity on me: the
          man who became my Viceroy.  He
          taught me how to survive.  And in
          that dark place, where there was
          nothing of myself, I found my Reman
          brothers.  They showed me the only
          kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

                     SHINZON
          For thousands of years the Romulan
          Senate has met in this chamber and
          dictated the fate of its sister-
          planet... But the time has come for
          us to live as equals.

                     PICARD
          You're doing this to liberate the
          Remans?

                     SHINZON
          No race should be a slave to
          another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

                     SHINZON
          You don't trust me.

                     PICARD
          I have no reason to.

                     SHINZON
          Of course you do.  If you had lived
          my life and experienced the
          suffering of my people... you'd be
          sitting where I am now.  At least I
          hope you would.

                     PICARD
          And if you had lived my life you
          would understand that there is a
          great responsibility in
          representing the Federation.  I
          can't let my personal feelings
          unduly influence my decisions.

                     SHINZON
          All I have is my personal feelings.
          I wasn't raised with the ideals of
          the Federation.  But I'm trying to
          understand them now.  To live up to
          them   To live up to you.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          I want to know where I come from.
          The Remans gave me a future.  You
          can tell me about my past.

                     PICARD
          There's so much, and so much of it
          is dull...

                     SHINZON
          Were we always explorers?

                     PlCARD
          No.  I was the first Picard to
          leave Earth.  It caused quite a
          stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
          whole life...

                     SHINZON
               (finishing the sentence)
          Looking up at the stars.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you dreamed about what was up
          there.  About...

                     PICARD
               (finishing the sentence)
          New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

                     PICARD
          After you, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

                     PICARD
          So I'm not as tall as you expected?

                     SHINZON
          I always hoped I would hit two
          meters.

                     PICARD
          With a full head of hair.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          There is that.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
          you.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

                     PICARD
          If there's one ideal the Federation
          holds most dear it's that all men,
          all races, can be united.  From the
          first time the Vulcans came to
          Earth we've sought a future of
          peace.  Nothing would make me more
          proud than to take your hand in
          friendship.  In time.  When trust
          has been earned.

                     SHINZON
          I'm honored to think I might
          someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          In time, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

                     VICEROY
          This is a mistake.

                     SHINZON
          He's gentler than I thought.  And
          he has a sense of humor.

                     VICEROY
               (stern)
          Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
          We should act.  Now.  Time is
          running out.

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          My time.  I'll spend it how I
          choose.

A tense beat.

                     SHINZON
          We'll return to the Scimitar.
          Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

                     PICARD
          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

                     GEORDI
          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Set up a security program to detect
          any unusual data stream rerouting.
          If it happens again, we want to be
          ready.

                     GEORDI
               (grim)
          There's something else.  I was
          reviewing the sensor logs...
               (he refers to some
                readouts on his console)
          When the Scimitar decloaked there
          was a momentary spike in the
          tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
          not going to believe this but it's
          Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

                     PICARD
          ... I thought Thalaron radiation
          was theoretical.

                     GEORDI
          Which is why our initial scans
          didn't pick it up.  But he's got
          it, Captain.

                     PICARD
          As I remember, Thalaron research
          was banned in the Federation
          because of its bioqenic properties.

                     BEVERLY
          It has the ability to consume
          organic material at the subatomic
          level.  I can't overestimate the
          danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
          Luc.  A microscopic amount could
          kill every living thing on this
          ship in a matter of seconds.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
          know what he has and how to
          neutralize any threat.  Give me
          options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

                     DATA
          Doctor, will you excuse us for a
          moment?  Geordi, please come with
          me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

                     PICARD
          Come...
               (Beverly enters)
          ... Beverly, come in.

                     BEVERLY
          You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Remember him?

                     BEVERLY
          He was a bit proud as I recall.

                     PICARD
          He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
          ambitious.  Very much in need of
          seasoning.

                     BEVERLY
          He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

                     DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
          I have identified the source of the
          unauthorized computer access.  And,
          I believe, we have also discovered
          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          On my way...

                     BEVERLY
               (stands)
          Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
          right now you're the man you've
          made yourself.  He's someone else.

                     PICARD
          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

                     DEANNA
          You're not here.

                     SHINZON
               (moving to her)
          Very logical, Deanna... But your
          heart doesn't constrain itself to
          mere logic.
               (he caresses her)
          ... Your heart longs to discover
          me.  To know me...
               (he kisses her)
          ... To leave all of this behind and
          be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

                     DEANNA
          No...

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your hunger to know the
          Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

                     SHINZON
          Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

                     VICEROY
          The bond is broken.

                     SHINZON
          Find her again.

                     VICEROY
          No -- this is wasting time.

                     SHINZON
          Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

                     REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
          Praetor, we've received the
          transponder signal.

                     SHINZON
               (to comm)
          On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

                     VICEROY
          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

                     BEVERLY
          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,
          you're completely normal.

                     PICARD
               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

                     DEANNA
          It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

                     DEANNA
               (with difficulty)
          Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
          ability to reach into my thoughts.
          I've become a liability... I
          request to be relieved of my
          duties.

                     PICARD
          Permission denied.  If you can
          possibly endure any more of these
          assaults.  I need you at my side.
          Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

                     RIKER
               (to comm)
          Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

                     SHINZON
          Hello, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Why am I here?

                     SHINZON
          I was lonely...
               (he realizes Picard is
                staring at the veins on
                his face)
          Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
          you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

                     PICARD
               (resists)
          What are you doing?

                     SHINZON
          I need a sample of your blood.
          What do your Borg friends say?
          Resistance is futile.
               (maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
          I learned there might be an
          existing prototype from a
          Cardassian historian, then went to
          a great deal of trouble to find it
          and scatter it about on Kolarus
          III.  I knew it would pique your
          curiosity and conveniently make the
          Enterprise the closest ship to
          Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

                     PICARD
          All of this so you could capture
          me?

                     SHINZON
          Don't be so vain.  After we found
          it, we made a few modifications.
          An extra memory port, a hidden
          transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
          will be a bit less confident when
          you learn I've gained access to
          Starfleet's communications
          protocols.  I now know the location
          of your entire fleet...
               (to B-9)
          ... You may go.

                     B-9
          Where?

                     SHINZON
          Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

                     SHINZON
          Maybe I'll train it to do little
          tricks for me like your robot does.
          Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
          off.

                     PICARD
          What's this all about?

                     SHINZON
          It's about destiny, Picard.  About
          a Reman outcast who --

                     PICARD
          You're not Reman.

                     SHINZON
          And I'm not quite human.  So what
          am I?  What do you see?
               (he peers at Picard
                deeply)
          Do you see a life you might have
          led?  Lost youth never to be
          recaptured?

                     PICARD
          I see a young man trying
          desperately to deny who he is.

                     SHINZON
          I see an old man, set in his ways,
          afraid to live without a uniform to
          prop him up and a Starfleet
          regulation to tell him what to do.
          I see the man I will never be.

                     PICARD
          I won't defend my life to you.

                     SHINZON
          My life is meaningless as long as
          you're alive.  What am I while you
          exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

                     PICARD
               (stern)
          If your issues are with me... This
          has nothing to do with my ship and
          nothing to do with the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
          bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
          the Romulans and not your mighty
          Federation.  We're a race bred for
          war.  For conquest.

                     PICARD
          Think about what you're doing,
          Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
          the entire quadrant into war to
          satisfy your own personal demons?

                     SHINZON
          It amazes me how little you know
          yourself.

                     PICARD
          I'm incapable of such an act, and
          so are you.

                     SHINZON
          I think the facts speak for
          themselves.  The same noble Picard
          blood runs in our veins.  Had you
          lived my life, you'd be doing
          exactly as I am.  Look in the
          mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

                     SHINZON
          Consider that, Captain.  I can
          think of no greater torment for
          you.

He turns to go.

                     PICARD
          It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

                     SHINZON
          Not for long, Captain.
               (back to Picard)
          I'm afraid you won't survive to
          witness the victory of the echo
          over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

                     WORF
          No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

                     GEORDI
               (frustrated)
          His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
          emissions, no residual antiprotons.

                     RIKER
          Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

                     BEVERLY
          Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

                     B-9
               (to Reman guard)
          I am to take the prisoner to the
          Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

                     B-9
          If you resist, I will incapacitate
          you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

                     VICEROY
               (to B-9)
          Where are you taking him?

                     B-9
          Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
          bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

                     VICEROY
          So, human... you've met your better
          self!

                     PICARD
          What are you doing to Counsellor
          Troi?

                     VICEROY
          I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
          sooth him as she soothes you.  To
          stand at his side as she does at
          yours.

                     PICARD
          That will never happen.

                     VICEROY
          Listen to him, android.  Such a
          small and weak creature.  Yet he
          roars so valiantly...
               (he raises one taloned
                claw and puts a sharp
                fingernail on Picard's
                chest)
          It would take me but an instant to
          tear that valiant heart from your
          chest.

                     PICARD
          There'll be another after me.  And
          another after that.  You'll find
          we're a resilient species.

                     VICEROY
          I look forward to the sport.
               (to the B-9, harshly)
          Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

                     B-9
          Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

                     PICARD
               (whispers)
          Be careful of over-playing your
          part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
          touch of reality to the
          performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

                     DATA
          My mission was a success, sir.  I
          have discovered the source of the
          Thalaron radiation.

                     PICARD
          Good work.  The download?

                     DATA
          He believes he has our
          communications protocols.  But they
          will give him inaccurate locations
          for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

                     DATA
          Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

                     PICARD
          A bit less florid, Data.

                     DATA
          Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

                     DATA
          This entire ship is, essentially, a
          flying Thalaron generator.
               (he points up)
          All its power relays lead to that
          device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

                     PICARD
          A weapon.

                     DATA
          It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

                     DATA
          Geordi equipped me with the
          prototype for the Emergency
          Transport Unit.  I recommend you
          use it to return to the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          It'll only work for one of us.

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.

                     PICARD
          We'll find a way off together.
          Recommendations?

                     DATA
          There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
          from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

                     VICEROY
          Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

                     DATA
          This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

                     DATA
               (looking at door security
                panel)
          It seems to have an encrypted
          security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

                     PICARD
          Alacrity would be appreciated,
          Commander.

                     DATA
          They are trying to override the
          access codes.  Reman is really a
          most complex language with
          pictographs representing certain
          verb roots and --

                     PICARD
          While I find that fascinating,
          Data, we really need that Goddamned
          door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

                     DATA
          According to the ship's manifest
          they are Scorpion-class attack
          fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

                     PICARD
               (trying to figure out the
                controls)
          What do you imagine this is?

                     DATA
          Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
          like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

                     PICARD
          Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
          They have instigated security
          overrides and erected a force field
          around the external portals.

                     PICARD
          Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

                     DATA
          Do you think this is a wise course
          of action?

                     PICARD
          We're about to find out... Power up
          disruptors and fire on my mark.

                     DATA
          Ready, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

                     SHINZON
          Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

                     SHINZON
          The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
          won't make it back to Federation
          space.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (angry)
          This has gone far enough!

                     SHINZON
          I thought we discussed patience,
          Commander.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          And mine is wearing thin, young
          man!  We supported you because you
          promised action.  And yet you delay
          and you waste your time playing
          games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic 
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Suran, the games are
          over.  In two days the Federation
          will be crippled beyond repair.
          Does that satisfy you?

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (grim)
          For the moment.

                     SHINZON
               (brutal)
          And when I return... you and I
          shall have a little talk about
          showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

                     DONATRA
          Does anyone in this room harbor any
          illusions about what he means by
          "showing proper respect"?

                     TAL'AURA
          What's happening to his face?

                     SURAN
          I want opinions.  He is clearly out
          of his mind.

                     SURAN
          But can he complete his mission?

                     DONATRA
          Should he?

They look at her.

                     DONATRA
          Are you prepared to have your hands
          drenched in blood?  He'll show them
          no mercy.  And his sins will mark
          us all for generations.  Is that
          what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

                     DONATRA
          I think you should consider that
          question now -- or else you may
          have a lifetime to think about it
          in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

                     BEVERLY
          The more I studied his DNA the more
          confusing it got.  Finally I could
          only come to one conclusion...
          Shinzon was created with temporal
          RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
          that at a certain point his aging
          process could be accelerated to
          reach your age more quickly, so he
          could replace you.

                     PICARD
          But the Romulans abandoned the
          plan...

                     BEVERLY
          As a result the temporal sequencing
          was never activated.  Remember, he
          was supposed to replace you at
          nearly your current age.  He was
          engineered to skip thirty years of
          life.  But since the RNA sequencing
          was never activated, his cellular
          structure has started to break
          down.  He's dying.

                     PICARD
          Dying?

                     RIKER
          He wasn't designed to live a
          complete, human life span.

                     PlCARD
          Can anything be done for him?

                     BEVERLY
          Not without a complete
          myelodysplastic infusion from the
          only donor with compatible DNA.
          But that would mean draining all
          your blood.

                     RIKER
          That's why he went to all that
          trouble to capture you.

                     PlCARD
          How long does he have?

                     BEVERLY
          I can't be sure but the rate of
          decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
          Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

                     B-9
          Brother.  I cannot move.

                     DATA
          No, I have only activated your
          cognitive and communication
          subroutines.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because you are dangerous.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          You have been programmed to gather
          information that can be used
          against this ship.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     DATA
          I know.

A beat.

                     DATA
          Do you know anything about
          Shinzon's plans against the
          Federation?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Do you have any knowledge of the
          tactical abilities of his ship?

                     B-9
          No.  Can I move now?

                     DATA
          No.  I must deactivate you.

                     B-9
          For how long?

                     DATA
          Indefinitely.

                     B-9
          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

                     RIKER
          Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
          Federation is crippled...

                     PICARD
          And the Romulans invade.

                     DEANNA
          How can you be certain?

                     PICARD
          I know how he thinks.

A beat.

                     RIKER
               (to Geordi)
          And there's no way to penetrate his
          cloak?

                     GEORDI
          No, sir.

                     RIKER
               (frustrated)
          He could pass within 10 meters of
          every ship in Starfleet and they'd
          never know.

                     BEVERLY
          But we do have one advantage.
               (to Picard)
          He needs your blood to live.  He
          might come after you first.

                     PICARD
          I'm counting on it... We've been
          ordered to head to sector 3274.
          Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
          meet us there.

                     RIKER
          Strength in numbers?

                     PICARD
          We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

                     PICARD
          He can't be allowed to use that
          weapon.  All other concerns are
          secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

                     RIKER
          Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

                     PICARD
          All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Personal Log.
          Supplemental.  We're heading toward
          Federation space at maximum warp.
          The crew has responded with the
          dedication I've come to expect of
          them.  And like a thousand other
          commanders on a thousand other
          battlefields throughout history, I
          wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          To seek out new life and new
          civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's
          own words.  When Charles Darwin set
          out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his
          journey into the unknown... he
          sailed without a single musket.

                     BEVERLY
               (gently)
          That was another time.

                     PICARD
          How far we've come.  Let me know if
          you need anything.

He starts to go --

                     BEVERLY
          Jean Luc...
               (he stops)
          ... He is not you.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          What makes us who we are, Doctor?
          Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

                     SHINZON
          How long?

                     VICEROY
          A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

                     VICEROY
          If you don't begin the procedure
          soon you'll never make it back to
          Romulus.  You shouldn't have
          delayed.  You should have killed
          Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

                     SHINZON
          How long until we reach the Rift?

                     VICEROY
               (checks a console)
          Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

                     PICARD
          Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          How long until we reach the fleet?

                     DATA
          At our current velocity we will
          arrive at sector 3274 in
          approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          "For now we see but through a glass
          darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

                     DATA
          Of you?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     DATA
          I do not agree.  Although you share
          the same genetic structure, the
          events of your life have created
          unique individual.

                     PICARD
          But so much is the same.  On a
          biological level he is... and I
          will not accept the idea that there
          is nothing I can do.  I have a
          responsibility to try to make a
          human connection with him.

                     DATA
          He would deny a "human" connection
          is possible.  He considers himself
          entirely Reman.

                     PICARD
          He may have already rejected my
          humanity, but you also have a twin.

                     DATA
          No, sir, it is not possible.  The
          B-9 is physically identical to me,
          although his neural pathways are
          not as advanced.  But even if they
          were, he would not be me.

                     PICARD
          How can you be sure?

                     DATA
          I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
          am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
          Shinzon.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We'll never know what Shinzon might
          have been.  Had he stood where I
          did as a child?  And looked up at
          the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          We are passing through the Bassen
          Rift.  The projections will return
          when we have cleared it.

                     PICARD
          It's interfering with our uplink
          from Starfleet cartography?

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
          long-range communications --

                     PICARD
                (urgent, to comm)
          Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

                     SHINZON
          Target weapons systems and shields.
          I don't want the Enterprise
          destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

                     SHINZON
          Can you learn to see in the dark,
          Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

                     PICARD
          Report.

                     RIKER
          He's firing through his cloak.  We
          can't get a lock.

                     GEORDI
               (at engineering station)
          He disabled our warp drive with his
          first shot.  We've only got
          impulse.

                     WORF
          Long range communication is
          impossible as long as we're in the
          rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

                     PICARD
          Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
          zero elevation.  All banks on my
          mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
          stand by photon torpedoes.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but
pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields
were momentarily illuminated.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          You're too slow, old man.
               (entering commands in his
                chair console)
          Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

                     DATA
          We are losing dorsal shields --

                     PICARD
          Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
          all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

INT.  ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     WORF
          Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm)
          Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
          Geordi, get those shields online.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Counselor Troi, report to the
          bridge.

                     RIKER
          Unless we can disable his cloak
          we're just going to be firing in
          the dark.

                     PlCARD
          Agreed.

                     WORF
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

                     SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, will you join me in
          your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

                     SHINZON
          You can't trace my holographic
          emitters, Captain.  So don't
          bother.  And you can't contact
          Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

                     PICARD
          We are.

                     SHINZON
          It's just the two of us now, Jean
          Luc, as it should be... Your ship
          and mine... You and me.

                     PICARD
          Why are you here?

                     SHINZON
          To accept your surrender.  I can
          clearly destroy you at any time.
          Lower your shields and allow me to
          transport you to my ship.

                     PICARD
          And what of the Enterprise?

                     SHINZON
          I have little interest in your
          quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
          Enterprise will withdraw to a
          distance of one hundred light
          years, it will not be harmed.

                     PICARD
          You know that's not possible.

                     SHINZON
          I know... you'll all gladly die to
          save your home world.

                     PICARD
               (intense)
          Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
          the blood pumping inside you?  Your
          hands, your eyes, your nature, are
          the same as mine.  Buried deep
          inside you beneath the years of
          pain and anger is a capacity you've
          forgotten.  It's the one way our
          mirror can reflect the two of us
          exactly because it's the very thing
          that truly defines us.  To be human
          is to try to make yourself better
          than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

                     PICARD
          I know you as well as I know
          myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
          you looked at the stars and dreamed
          of what might be.

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          Long ago.

                     PICARD
          Not so long.

                     SHINZON
          Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
          the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
          what you see now.

                     PICARD
          I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

                     PICARD
          I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

                     PICARD
          The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
          Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
          the population of an entire planet!
          He is better than that!

                     SHINZON
               (desperate)
          He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

                     PICARD
          And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

                     PICARD
          If I were to beam to your ship...
          let you complete your medical
          procedure, give you a full life...
          what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

                     PICARD
          You once asked me about your past.
          Your history.  When I was your age,
          I burned with ambition.  I was very
          proud and my pride often hurt
          people.  I made every wrong choice
          a young man can... But one thing
          saved me... I had a father who
          believed in me.  Who took the time
          to teach me a better way.  You have
          the same father.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.

                     PICARD
          So if I gave you my life, what
          would you do with it?  Would you
          spend the years in a blaze of
          hatred as you are now?  Or could
          you change?  Could you try to
          remember a mother's touch you never
          felt?  A father's words you never
          heard?  Could you do that?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I don't know.

                     PICARD
          But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

                     PICARD
          Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

                     SHINZON
          That's your life... not mine.

                     PICARD
          Please.

                     SHINZON
          It's too late.

                     PICARD
          You can still make a choice!  Make
          the right one now!

                     SHINZON
          I have no choices!  I can't fight
          what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

                     SHINZON
          I'll show you my true nature.  Your
          nature.  And as Earth dies --
          remember that I'm forever Shinzon
          of Remus!  And my voice will echo
          through time long after yours has
          faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

                     SHINZON
          Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

                     SHINZON
          Report!

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Two ships decloaking, sir!
          Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

                     RIKER
          Believe it or not, I think the
          cavalry has arrived.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
          of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
          be of assistance?

                     PICARD
          Your timing is impeccable,
          Commander.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          The Empire considers this a matter
          of internal security.  We regret
          you've become involved.

                     PICARD
          When this is over, I owe you a
          drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
          work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          You heard the lady.  Get to work.
          Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Coordinate our attack with the
          Valdore's tactical officer.
          Triangulate fire on any shield
          impacts.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir.

The Enterprise ROCKS from a photon torpedo impact --

                     DATA
          Aft shields are down to forty
          percent.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm)
          Keep our bow to the Scimitar.
          Auxiliary power to forward shields.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

                     SHINZON
          Target the flanking Warbird.  All
          forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

                     DATA
          Forward shields are down to ten
          percent.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm)
          Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
          aft port quadrant and prepare for
          full emergency stop.

                     VICEROY
               (startled)
          What?!

                     SHINZON
          You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

                     DONATRA
          She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
          all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     VICEROY
          She's almost on us.

                     SHINZON
          Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

                     VICEROY
          Praetor...

                     SHINZON
          FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
          about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I'm afraid that drink will have to
          wait, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Do you have life support?

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          For the moment.  But we're dead in
          the water.

                     PICARD
          Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     DATA
          We have lost structural integrity
          on decks twelve through seventeen,
          sections four through ten.

                     GEORDI
          Emergency force fields are holding.

                     RIKER
          Evacuate those decks and reroute
          field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

                     DEANNA
          Captain -- I might have a way to
          find them.

                     PICARD
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          The one thing he may have forgotten
          in the course of battle: me.

                     PICARD
          Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

                     SHINZON
          Prepare a lateral run -- all
          starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

                     VICEROY
          No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

                     DEANNA
          He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

                     SHINZON
          What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

                     VICEROY
          She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

                     DEANNA
          Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

                     DEANNA
          NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

                     PICARD
          Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

                     SHINZON
               (spinning to his Viceroy)
          Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
          ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

                     SHINZON
          Get the cloak back!  And target
          shield coordinates beta three.  All
          disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                     DATA
          Captain, we have lost ventral
          shielding on deck twenty nine.

                     PICARD
          Divert power and compensate --

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

                     WORF
          Intruder alert!

                     RIKER
          Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

                     WORF
               (to comm)
          Security detail to deck twenty
          nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

                     RIKER
          Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

                     GEORDI
          He's getting his cloak back.  We
          have exhausted our compliment of
          photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
          down to four percent.

                     PICARD
          What if we target all phasers in a
          concentrated attack?

                     DATA
          The Scimitar's shields are still at
          seventy percent.  It would make no
          difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

                     DEANNA
          They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

                     GEORDI
          What's he doing?

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

                     PICARD
          He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
          going to do...

                     GEORDI
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

                     SHINZON
          Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

                     DATA
          We are being hailed.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, stand by.
               (to Data)
          Open a channel.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you're still alive, Jean
          Luc.

                     PICARD
          I am.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Don't you think it's time to
          surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
          in a matter of minutes and your
          poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
          should the rest of your crew have
          to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

                     PICARD
          I never told you about my first
          Academy evaluation, did I?  I
          received very high marks for my
          studies.  But I was found lacking
          in certain other areas.
          Personality traits, you might say.
          In particular I was thought to be
          extremely...
               (he glares up at the prow
                of the Scimitar)
          ... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

                     PICARD
               (quickly)
          Geordi, put 211 power to the
          engines.  Take it from life support
          if you have to -- everything you
          can give me.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, on my mark.

                     GEORDI
          Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

                     PICARD
               (on comm)
          All hands, brace for impact!
               (to Deanna)
          ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

                     SHINZON
          HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

                     SHINZON
          Divert all power to engines.  Full
          reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

                     RIKER
          Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
          voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
          Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
          Zero Five --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          What about Picard?

                     SHINZON
          Our greater goal is more important,
          brother.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          But, Praetor, you won't survive
          without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

                     SHINZON
          Some ideals are worth dying for,
          aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

                     PICARD
          How long until he can fire?

                     GEORDI
          The targeting sequence should take
          about four minutes.

                     DEANNA
          But how can he?  He'll kill you.

                     PICARD
          This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

                     PICARD
          Prepare for a site-to-site
          transport.

                     GEORDI
               (concerned)
          Sir, we won't be able to bring you
          back.  It's a one way trip.
          Captain, I don't know if the
          transporter --

                     PICARD
          That's an order, Commander.

                     DATA
          Sir, allow me to go.  You are
          needed here.

                     PICARD
          Negative.

                     DATA
          Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

                     DEANNA
          Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          You have the bridge, Commander.
          Use all available power to move
          away from the Scimitar.
               (to Geordi)
          Now, Mister La Forge.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

                     GEORDI
          That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

                     DATA
          Counsellor Troi, please assume
          command.  Geordi, if you will come
          with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

                     DATA
          What is our approximate distance?

                     GEORDI
               (scans with tricorder)
          400 meters.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

                     DATA
          Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
          field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

                     COMPUTER (V.O)
          Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

                     SHINZON
          I'm glad we're together now -- our
          destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

                     DATA
          Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

                     DEANNA
          Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

                     GEORDI
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen...
               (he remembers there is no
                longer a viewscreen)
          ... Open a channel.

                     DONATRA (V.O.)
          This is Commander Donatra of the
          Valdore.  We're dispatching
          shuttles with medical personnel and
          supplies.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (flat)
          Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
          for arrivals.  They don't know our
          procedures so just... open the
          doors.

                     GEORDI
          I'll take care of it, sir.

                     PICARD
          Number One.
               (a beat)
          You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

                     PICARD
          To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

                     PICARD
          I don't know if all this has made
          sense to you, but I wanted you to
          know what kind of man he was.  In
          his quest to be more like us, he
          helped show us what it means to be
          human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

                     B-9
          My brother was not a human.

                     PICARD
          No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
          his curiosity about every facet of
          human life helped all of us see the
          best parts of ourselves.  He
          embraced change... because he
          always wanted to be more than he
          was.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     PICARD
          Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
          to tow us to spacedock.

                     PICARD
          On my way.  Please notify Commander
          Riker...
               (he stands, prepares to
                go)
          ... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

                     B-9
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

                     PICARD
          I'm sorry you won't be here for the
          re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
          you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

                     PICARD
          The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
          she's getting a captain worthy of
          her.

                     RIKER
          She's the most beautiful ship I've
          ever seen.
               (he touches a wall of the
                corridor)
          ... But she's not the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          I promise you in time, she'll
          become your home... If I could
          offer you one piece of advice?

                     RIKER
          Anything.

                     PICARD
          When your first officer insists
          that you can't go on away
          missions... Ignore him --

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          I intend to.

A moment.

                     RIKER
               (with difficulty)
          Serving with you has been an honor.

                     PICARD
          The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

                     MADDEN
          So... what's the old man like?

                     OPS OFFICER
          Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
          They're kids!  All with advance
          degrees in xenobiology and out to
          conquer every disease in the
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Reminds me of a young doctor I used
          to know...

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          They're running me ragged.  Nothing
          but questions day and night... I
          love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
          tell you all about it.  There's a
          Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

                     PICARD
          Not tonight, I have work here.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Soon then.  I'll save the last
          dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

                     MADDEN
          Commander Martin Madden reporting
          for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

                     PICARD
          Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
          your transfer didn't come as too
          much of a surprise.

                     MADDEN
          I was... honored, sir.

                     PICARD
          I needed you immediately to help
          oversee the re-fit...
               (gathering up some padds
                from his desk)
          ... Your service record on the
          Talos is exemplary, but there are a
          few things I would like to discuss
          with you regarding my requirements
          for a First Officer.  Shall we say
          dinner in my quarters at 1900
          hours?

                     MADDEN
          Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

                     PICARD
          Commander, I don't know how they
          did it on the Talos, but we have
          door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
          use them.

                     MADDEN
          Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

                     WORF
          You don't understand the Captain --
          there should be no changes until we
          have discussed the modifications
          with him.

Picard goes to them:

                     PICARD
          What's this?

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          Your new chair, sir.

                     ENSIGN
          It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
          State-of-the-art ergonomics...
          command interfaces with --

                     WORF
          I told him you're comfortable with
          your old chair.

                     PICARD
          Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

                     PICARD
          Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

                     ENSIGN
               (points)
          Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

                     PICARD
          It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

                     PICARD
          Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

                     PICARD
          ... We've received our first
          assignment.  We're going to be
          exploring the Denab system.  It
          should be exciting.  It's a
          place... where no one has gone
          before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

                     B-9 (V.O.)
          "Never saw the sun shining so
          bright, Never saw things going so
          right.  Noticing the days hurrying
          by, When you're in love, my how
          they fly.  Blue days, all of them
          gone, Nothing but blue skies from
          now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

                                                FADE OUT.

                          John Logan

































FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

                     SENATOR 1
          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose
          this important source of dilithium.
          A trade agreement is in the best
          interests of the Empire.

                     SENATOR 2
          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
          diplomatic mission to Celes II to
          open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

                     PRAETOR
          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
          the motion.

                     TAL'AURA
          No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
          is to be advised.  I support all
          "diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
          will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
          appointment with the Tholian
          ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

                     PRAETOR
          Then I will call for a vote on the
          motion to open trade negotiations
          with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

                     PRAETOR
          Would someone please tell me what
          that was?
               (he turns to a guard)
          Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

                     PRAETOR
          -- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

                     PICARD
          Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

                     PICARD
          A starship captain's life is filled
          with solemn duty.  I have commanded
          men in battle.  I have negotiated
          peace treaties between implacable
          enemies.  I have represented the
          Federation in first contact with
          twenty-seven alien species.  But
          none of this compares to my solemn
          duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

                     PICARD
          Now, I know that on an occasion
          such as this: it is expected that I
          be gracious and fulsome with praise
          on the wonders of this blessed
          union... But have you two
          considered what you're doing to?
          This is all a damned
          inconvenience...
               (laughter from the crowd)
          While you're happily settling in on
          the Titan, I'll have to train a new
          first officer; no doubt a stern
          martinet who'll quote the rule book
          at me and never... ever... allow me
          to go on away missions.
               (laughter)
          ... Then there's the matter of my
          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
          be probing into my darkest psyche
          as she nods her head and coos
          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
          Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

                     PICARD
          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
          with the rest of you.  As most of
          you know, the doctor will also soon
          be leaving the Enterprise, to
          assume command of Starfleet
          Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
          Beverly, have you considered what
          you're doing to little ole' me?!
          I'll probably get some old battle-
          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
          eat my vegetables and put me on
          report if I don't show up for my
          physical on time!

                     BEVERLY
          It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

                     PICARD
          Really, it's not too late to
          reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

                     PICARD
          Will Riker, you have been my
          trusted right arm for fourteen
          years; you have helped keep my
          course true and steady.  Deanna
          Troi, you have been my conscience
          and best guide, the touchstone to
          the better parts of myself.  You
          are my family.  And in proper
          maritime tradition I wish you full
          sails and a clear horizon... My
          friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

                     BEVERLY
               (playfully)
          Sort of like losing a son and
          gaining an empath, isn't it?

                     PICARD
          Please, Beverly, this is hard
          enough.

                     BEVERLY
          If you start tearing up I promise
          to beam you out.  Level one medical
          emergency.  There's no crying in
          Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

                     LEAH
          I've never seen your Captain so
          nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
          in his old age.

                     GEORDI
               (laughs)
          Not likely.  After we installed the
          new Series Four replicators, he
          tried to order his usual tea and
          there was a glitch.  Had us remove
          the whole bunch of them and put the
          old ones back in.

                     LEAH
          There!  Nostalgic about old
          replicators.

                     GEORDI
          He just likes things the way he
          likes them...
               (he looks at her, smiles)
          Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

                     WORF
          Romulan ale should be illegal.

                     GEORDI
          It is, old chum.

                     WORF
          Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

                     DEANNA
          Really, Captain, it was a lovely
          toast.

                     PICARD
          The least I could do for you,
          Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
          I'm a talking head.

                     DEANNA
          And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
          your new counselor on everything
          she needs to know.

                     PICARD
          The hell you will.  You know too
          much about me as it is... Now you
          promised there are no speeches
          during the ceremony on Betazed.

                     RIKER
          No, no speeches.  No clothes
          either.
               (winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

                     DATA
          Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
          Tran gendered species... In my
          study of Terran and Betazoid
          conjugal rites I have discovered it
          is traditional to present the
          "happy couple" with a gift.  Given
          Commander Riker's affection for
          archaic musical forms I have
          elected to present the following as
          my gift in honor of their
          conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

                     DATA
          If you please, Mister Band Leader,
          a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

                     DATA
               (sings)
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see.  Blue
          birds, singing a song, Nothing but
          blue birds all day long.  Never saw
          the sun shining so bright, Never
          saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

                     WORF
               (groans)
          Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

                     DEANNA
               (smiles)
          All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          May I have this dance?

                     DEANNA
          With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

                     BEVERLY
          Commander Worf... Do Klingons
          swing?

                     WORF
          I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

                     BEVERLY
          Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

                     BEVERLY
          I'm so glad you made it back to the
          Enterprise before I left.

                     WORF
          I was not suited for the life of
          a... diplomat.

                     BEVERLY
               (wry)
          Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

                     PICARD
          I've been saving this.  Chateau
          Picard 2267.  Batten down the
          hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

                     PICARD
          They say a vintner's history is in
          every glass.  The soil he came
          from.  His past as well as his
          hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

                     PICARD
          So... To happy endings.

                     DATA
          To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

                     DATA
          Sir.  I noticed an interesting
          confluence of emotion at the
          wedding.  I am familiar with the
          human concept of tears through
          laughter and its inverse, laughter
          through tears, but I could not help
          wondering about the human capacity
          for expressing both pleasure and
          sadness simultaneously.

                     PICARD
          I understand why it would seem
          confusing.  Certain human rituals --
          like weddings, birthdays or
          funerals evoke strong and very
          complex emotions.  These rites
          carry great weight with us because
          they denote the passage of time.

                     DATA
          And you were particularly aware of
          this feeling because Commander
          Riker will be leaving to assume
          command of the Titan?

                     PICARD
          Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
          Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
          Medical...

                     DATA
          And this makes you "sad"?

                     PICARD
          Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
          I'm very happy for them, of course,
          but I'm going to miss them.  The
          ship will seem... incomplete
          without them.

                     DATA
          That is because you have a
          familiarity with them.  You can
          predict specific reactions and
          behavior and are comfortable in
          that knowledge.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
          well.  They've made important
          choices; they're going to have
          great challenges ahead of them.
          New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          Seeing Will and Deanna today made
          me think about some of the choices
          I've made in my own life.  Devoting
          myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
          or having children... All the
          choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

                     DATA
          The choices I made have led me here
          as well.  This is the only home I
          have ever known.  I cannot foresee
          a reason for leaving.

                     PICARD
          You never know what's over the
          horizon, Data.  Before too long
          you'll be offered a command of your
          own.  Data looks at him; he has
          never really considered this.

                     DATA
          If I were... I believe my memory
          engrams would sense the absence of
          your specific reactions and
          behavior.  I would "miss you."

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Now, you make a toast.

                     DATA
          To new worlds...

                     PICARD
          New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
          worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

                     SURAN
          The fleet commanders are nervous.
          They've agreed to remain at their
          given coordinates and await his
          orders.  But they're anxious to
          know what's going on here.

                     DONATRA
          I don't blame them.  We can't keep
          them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

                     VICEROY (V.O.)
          But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

                     VICEROY
          Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Consider it  The great symbol of
          the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
          holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
          Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Yet for generations one of those
          planets has been without a voice.
          We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
          the disposition of the fleet?

                     SURAN
          They're holding position.

                     SHINZON
          And?

                     SURAN
               (bows his head)
          They will obey, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          It's imperative we retain their
          allegiance or our great mission
          will be strangled before it can
          truly draw breath.

                     DONATRA
          They support your intentions, sir.
          But they require evidence of
          your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

                     SHINZON
          And they'll have it.
               (he begins to pace over
                the star chart)
          Tell the fleet that the days of
          negotiation and diplomacy are over.
          The Almighty Federation will fall
          before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          The time we have dreamed of is at
          hand.  The time... of conquest.
               (sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Cut off the dragon's head and it
          cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

                     SURAN
          How many Warbirds will you need?

                     SHINZON
          None.

They look at him, stunned.

                     SURAN
          Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
          at your disposal.  They supported
          the coup, they'll follow you.

                     SHINZON
          The Scimitar will serve my needs.

                     SURAN
          But surely --

                     SHINZON
          I came this far alone...
               (he looks at his Reman
                warriors)
          We came this far alone.  We require
          no assistance from the fleet.  Now
          leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Are we prepared?

                     VICEROY
          Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          So many years for this moment.
               (he looks up at his
                Viceroy, smiles)
          Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          I won't do it.

                     DEANNA
          It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
          people should appreciate that!
               (whispers)
          Besides, I've already seen it.

                     WORF
          A warrior does not appear without
          his clothing.  It leaves him...
          vulnerable.

                     RIKER
          I don't think we're going to see
          much combat on Betazed.

                     DEANNA
          Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
          there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

                     WORF
          I won't do it.

                     PICARD
          Won't do what, Mister Worf?

                     WORF
          Captain.  I think it is
          inappropriate for a Starfleet
          officer to appear...
               (hates the word)
          ... naked.

                     PICARD
          Come now, a big, strapping fellow
          like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

                     WORF
          I'm picking up an unusual
          electromagnetic signature from the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

                     WORF
          Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

                     GEORDI
          It's very faint but I've isolated
          it to the third planet in the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the planet?

                     GEORDI
          Uncharted.  We'll have to get
          closer for a more detailed scan.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Theories?

                     DATA
          Since positronic signatures have
          only been known to emanate from
          androids such as myself, it is
          logical to theorize that there is
          an android such as myself on
          Kolarus III.

                     GEORDI
          How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

                     DATA
          I thought only me, myself and Lore.

                     RIKER
               (looking at star chart)
          Diverting to the Kolarin system
          takes us awfully close to the
          Romulan Neutral Zone.

                     PICARD
               (looking at star chart)
          Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

                     PICARD
          I think it's worth a look.  Don't
          worry, Number One, we'll get you to
          Betazed with time to spare.

                     RIKER
          Thank you, sir...

                     PICARD
               (to all, especially Worf)
          Where we will all honor the
          Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
          or any other parts of our anatomy.
          Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
          in the gym.

He goes.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm Officer)
          Mister Branson, set course for the
          Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
               (Deanna shoots him a
                glance)
          -- Warp Seven.

                     HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
          Plotted and laid in, sir.

                     RIKER
          Engage.

                     DEANNA
          You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

                     GEORDI
          What do you think, Data, a long-
          lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

                     GEORDI
          I read six distinct positronic
          signatures, spread out over a few
          kilometers on the surface.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the
          population?

                     DATA
          Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
          appears to be a pre-warp
          civilization at an early stage of
          industrial development.

                     GEORDI
          Captain, I don't recommend
          transporting, that ion storm
          doesn't look very neighborly.  It
          could head this way without much
          warning.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
          with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

                     RIKER
               (stands, protesting)
          Captain, I hope I don't have to
          remind you --

                     PICARD
          I appreciate your concern, Number
          One, but I've been itching to try
          out the Argo.

                     RIKER
          Sir --

                     PICARD
          Captain's prerogative, Will.
          There's no foreseeable danger...
          and your wife would never forgive
          me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

                     PICARD
          You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

                     DATA
          The closest signature is two
          kilometers to the west... that
          direction, sir.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Data.
               (he smiles)
          Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

                     DATA
          I will always be baffled by the
          human predilection for piloting
          vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

                     DATA
               (monitoring with
                tricorder)
          Over that rise, sir... half a
          kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

                     DATA
          It appears to be...
               (he scans with his
                tricorder)
          ... an arm.

                     WORF
               (suspicious)
          Why is it moving?

                     DATA
          Like me, it has been designed with
          modular power sources.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

                     DATA
          The next signature is one kilometer
          to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

                     DATA
          The final signature is
          approximately 300 meters up that
          incline.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

                     WORF
               (uneasy)
          To find the head, sir?

                     PICARD
               (amused)
          If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

                     DATA
          Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

                     DATA
          I think it unlikely you will need
          your phaser to recover the cranial
          unit.  Of course, it could bite
          you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

                     WORF
          It's you.

                     DATA
          The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

                     HEAD
          Why am I looking at me?

                     DATA
          You are not looking at yourself.
          You are looking at me.

                     HEAD
               (looking at Worf)
          You do not look like me.

                     WORF
          No.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          I would like to pick you up now.
          May I do that?

                     HEAD
               (to Worf)
          You have a pretty shirt.

                     WORF
          Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

                     DATA
          Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

                     HEAD
          I have two arms and ten fingers.
          Do you know where my arms are?  I
          cannot see where we are going.
          Where are we going?
               (Etc... like Threepio in
                "Empire" when he's
                strapped to Chewbacca's
                back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

                     DATA
          Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

                     WORF
          STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT./ EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

                     WORF
          If you wouldn't mind.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

                     HEAD
          You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

                     DATA
          He is very observant.

                     PICARD
          I can see that.

                      WORF
          Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Shall we try some "unsafe
          velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

                     HEAD
               (to Picard)
          You have a red shirt.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          This is not an appropriate time for
          a conversation.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because the captain has to
          concentrate on piloting the
          vehicle.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Data!

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

                     PICARD
          Mister Data.  Let's make like the
          wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

                     WORF
               (smiles)
          He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

                     BEVERLY
          I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

                     DATA
          Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

                     RIKER
          Geordi?

                     GEORDI
               (at work analyzing the
                torso section)
          Well, he seems to have the same
          internal mechanics as Data but not
          as much positronic development.
          The neural pathways aren't nearly
          as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
          prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
          created before Data.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          Do you have a name, sir?

                     HEAD
          I am the B-9.

                     PICARD
          Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
          whimsical names seems to have no
          end.

                     HEAD
               (to Riker)
          You have a fuzzy face.

                     PICARD
               (trying to ignore the
                head)
          Keep me informed, Number One, and,
          please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

                     DATA
          Can you tell me how you came to be
          on the planet where we found you?

                     B-9
               (blandly)
          I was taken from my homeworld by
          people called the "PakJeds." They
          are fat.  They traded me to a ship
          belonging to the "Bolians." The
          "Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
          a seat and asked me questions.
          Then they were attacked by another
          ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

                     B-9
          Then people called the
          Delviciansans picked me up.  They
          have long teeth.  They asked if I
          do anything to help them.  I told
          them I could do whatever they
          wanted.  They asked me to clean out
          the matrix manifolds.  I told them
          I did not know what an Matrix
          manifold looks like.

                     BEVERLY
          Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
          to run on some medical scanner
          things.

She quickly exits.

                     B-9
          And after they showed me the
          "engine manifolds." Then they
          showed me something called a
          "plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

                     B-9
          ... then the "Cardassians" put me
          into something called a "garbage
          chute" and I went out into space
          again --

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
          the tactical manifests ready, sir.

                     RIKER
               (quickly tapping his comm
                badge)
          Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
          there!...
               (he stands)
          Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

                     B-9
          Fuzzy face is gone.

                     DATA
          Yes, please continue.

                     B-9
          I was in space for a long time.
          Then a ship belonging to the
          "Talosians" picked me up.  They
          asked me where I came from.  I told
          them people called the "Pakleds"
          took me from my homeworld.  They
          are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

                     B-9
          Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

                     DATA
          Do you know who I am?

                     B-9
          You are me.

                     DATA
          No.  My name is Data... I am your
          brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

                     DEANNA
               (to Worf)
          ... and after the ceremony on
          Betazed, three entire weeks for our
          honeymoon.

                     RIKER
          We're going sailing on the Opal
          Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
          solar catamaran.  Just us and the
          sun and the waves.

                     WORF
          It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

                     DEANNA
               (amused)
          It's meant to be relaxing.

                     WORF
          A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
          Kholamar desert march where the
          couple bonds in endurance trials.
          If they survive the challenge they
          move on to the Fire Caves of
          Fek'lhr to face the demons of
          Gre'thor.

                     RIKER
          Well, that sounds relaxing too.

                     WORF
          It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

                     RIKER
          So they've got him up and running.

                     WORF
          He's a very unusual android

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

                     PICARD
          Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

                     PICARD
          Come.
               (Deanna enters)
          Counselor.

                     DEANNA
          Do you have a moment, sir?

                     PICARD
          Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

                     DEANNA
          It's about Data  I've watched him
          with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
          Data's desire for a "family" is
          very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
          investing too much in the B-9.

                     PICARD
          You're speaking of emotional
          investment?

                     DEANNA
          The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
          And Data, in his own way, has
          assumed the position of a parent or
          guardian.  I'm afraid he has
          expectations based on his own
          experiences.  He'll be disappointed
          when the B-9 cannot meet those
          expectations.

                     PICARD
          As much as we care for him,
          Deanna... we have to remember that
          Data isn't capable of
          disappointment.

                     DEANNA
          I don't believe that, sir.  We've
          shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          I'm going to miss you.

                     DEANNA
          And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

                     RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
          communication from Starfleet
          Command.

                     PICARD
          Acknowledged...
               (Deanna stands)
          ... I'll talk to Data

                     DEANNA
          Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

                     PICARD
          Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
          to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          With or without the rest of the
          fleet?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          A diplomatic mission.  We've been
          invited, believe it or not.  Seems
          there's been some kind of internal
          political shakeup.  The new
          Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
          has requested a Federation envoy.

                     PICARD
          New Praetor?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          There's more... as always.  He's
          Reman.
               (Picard is surprised)
          Believe me, we don't understand it
          either.  You're the closest ship so
          I want you to high tail it over
          there and hear what he has to say.
          Get the lay of the land, If the
          Empire becomes unstable, it could
          mean trouble for the entire
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
          Understood.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
          We're sending you all the
          intelligence we have, but it's not
          much.  I don't need to tell you to
          watch your back, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Not with the Romulans.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (smiles wryly)
          The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
          the evil Soran and that pesky
          Nexus.  You seem to get all the
          easy assignments!

                     PICARD
          Just lucky, Admiral.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Let's hope that luck holds.
          Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

                     PICARD
               (to Helm)
          Lay in a new course... Take us to
          Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

                     HELM OFFICER
          Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
          laid in...

                     RIKER
          Romulus?

                     PICARD
          I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
          to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

                     DATA
          As you can see the habitable half
          of Remus is always in darkness
          because, like Mercury, one side
          always faces the sun.  Due to the
          extreme temperatures on that half
          of their world, the Remans live on
          the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

                     DATA
          Almost nothing is known about the
          Reman homeworld, although
          intelligence scans have proven the
          existence of dilithium mining and
          heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

                     DATA
          The Remans themselves are
          considered an undesirable caste in
          the hierarchy of the Empire.

                     RIKER
          But they also have the reputation
          of being formidable warriors.  In
          the Dominion War, Reman forces were
          used as assault troops in the most
          violent encounters.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          Cannon fodder.

                     GEORDI
          Then how did a Reman get to be
          Praetor?  I don't get it.

                     RIKER
          We have to assume he had Romulan
          collaborators.

                     PICARD
          A coup d'etat?

                     RIKER
          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about
          Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

                     DATA
          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

                     DATA
          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

                     DATA
          Do you know the name of the Captain
          of this vessel?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Is that your final answer?

                     GEORDI
               (to B-9)
          Do you know my name?

                     B-9
          You have a soft voice.

                     GEORDI
               (gently)
          Data, he's assimilating a lot of
          programming.  Remember, he's a
          prototype, a lot less sophisticated
          than you are.  We just don't know
          if his matrix will be able to
          adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
          retain anything.  We should give
          him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

                     DATA
          What purpose does this serve?

                     GEORDI
               (also examining circuitry)
          It seems to be a redundant memory
          port.  Maybe it's for provisional
          memory storage in case his neural
          pathways overload?

                     DATA
          Dr. Soong must have found it
          unnecessary in later versions.

                     GEORDI
          It's possible the extra memory port
          is interfering with the engram
          processing.  Mind if I keep him
          here and run some diagnostics?

                     DATA
          No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

                     DATA
          But I believe he will prove
          incapable of performing higher
          functions.

                     GEORDI
          Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
          I know, you're not capable of hope.

                     DATA
               (looking at B-9)
          I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

                     DATA
          No, remain with Commander La Forge.
          He is going to try to make you
          well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
          The Enterprise has arrived at
          Romulus and is waiting at the
          designated coordinates.  All our
          hails have gone unanswered.  We've
          been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

                     RIKER
          Why don't they answer our hails?

                     PICARD
          It's an old psychological strategy,
          Number One.  To put him in a
          position of dominance and make us
          uneasy.

                     RIKER
          It's working.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

                     WORF
          Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

                     PICARD
          Not yet, Mister Worf.

                     RIKER
          Captain, with all due respect to
          diplomatic protocols -- the
          Federation Council's not sitting
          out here, we are.

                     PICARD
          Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
          exacting occupation.  We can wait.

                     DATA
          Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
               (slowly rising from his
                chair)
          My God...

                     WORF
               (tense)
          Should I raise shields?

                     PICARD
          No!

                     WORF
          Captain -- !

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

                     WORF
               (quickly analyzing
                tactical display)
          Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
          seven photon torpedo bays, primary
          and secondary phased shields.

                     RIKER
          She's not out for a pleasure
          cruise.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          She's a predator.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Enterprise.  We are the Reman
          Warbird Scimitar.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I am not Shinzon.  I am his
          Viceroy.  We are sending transport
          coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Not very chatty.

                     PICARD
          Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you'll forgive the
          darkness... we're not comfortable
          in the light.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

                     SHINZON
          Captain Picard... Jean Luc
          Picard... I don't mean to stare,
          it's just -- well, you can't
          imagine how long I've been waiting
          for this moment.  I always imagined
          you taller, isn't that odd?
               (to Data)
          You may scan me without subterfuge,
          Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

                     PICARD
          And you're not as we imagined you.

                     SHINZON
          No?

                     WORF
          You are human.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Worf.
               (he speaks in Klingon)
          I greet you as a valiant warrior...
          and as my brother.

                     WORF
               (terse, in Klingon)
          I'll save my greetings for a better
          brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

                     PICARD
          Why have you asked for our presence
          here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

                     PICARD
          Praetor?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

                     DEANNA
          I'm only half human.

                     SHINZON
          Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
          and telepathic abilities, ship's
          counselor.  All of this I knew...
          But I didn't know you were so
          beautiful.

                     RIKER
          You seem very familiar with our
          personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

                     SHINZON
          I am, Commander Riker...
               (to Deanna)
          ... May I touch your hair?

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
          matter we were -- assured was of
          great importance.  If you have
          anything to say to us as
          representatives of the Federation,
          I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

                     SHINZON
               (softly)
          On the world I come from there's no
          light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
          important.  I see now there's a
          world elsewhere.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
          discuss your lack of a social life.

                     SHINZON
               (turning back to Picard)
          Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
               (he smiles)
          There's so much we have to talk
          about.

                     PICARD
          I would be interested to know what
          we are talking about.

                     SHINZON
          Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
          walls between us to recognize we
          are one people.  Federation and
          Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
          Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
          the thing that makes us the same.
          We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

                     SHINZON
          I want to end the centuries of
          mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
          not your enemy.  As a first step I
          propose we eliminate the Neutral
          Zone and begin a free and open
          exchange of goods and ideas.

                     PICARD
          And the Senate supports you?

                     SHINZON
               (dry)
          I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          Right now, you're thinking this all
          sounds too good to be true?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you're wondering why the
          Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
          the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
          predator?
               (Picard is startled at
                Shinzon's choice of
                words)
          ... But you're also thinking the
          chance for peace is too promising
          to ignore.  Above all, you're
          trying to decide if you can trust
          me.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          Then perhaps the time has come to
          add some illumination to our
          discussion.  Computer, raise
          lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Allow me to tell you a story that I
          hope will clarify my position.
          When I was very young I was
          stricken with an odd disease.  I
          developed a hyper-sensitivity to
          sound.  The slightest whisper
          caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

                     SHINZON
          No one knew what to do.  Finally I
          was taken to a doctor who had some
          experience with Terran illnesses
          and I was finally diagnosed with
          Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
          it, Captain?

                     PICARD
          You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Then you know it's a very rare
          syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
          members of my family had it.
          Eventually I was treated.  Now I
          can hear as well as you can,
          Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

                     SHINZON
          I can see as well as you can.  I
          can feel everything you feel.
               (He stops right before
                Picard)
          In fact, I feel exactly what you
          feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

                     SHINZON
          Do you trust me now?

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We need to talk, just you and I.

                     SHINZON
          Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
          Just the two of us.  Or just the
          one of us.

                     PICARD
          You know I need to verify this.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

                     SHINZON
          Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
          much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

                     PICARD
          Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
          out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

                     BEVERLY
          There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
          down to your regressive strain of
          Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

                     PICARD
          When was he... created?

                     BEVERLY
          About twenty-five years ago.  They
          probably used a hair follicle or
          skin cell.

                     PICARD
               (touching head)
          I think a skin cell's the more
          likely of the two.

                     RIKER
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Believe me, Number One; I'm going
          to find out.  Contact Starfleet
          Command and inform them of the
          situation.  I need to know where
          the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

                     DEANNA
          I would say he's been trained to
          resist telepathy.  What I could
          sense of his emotions were erratic,
          very hard to follow.

                     PICARD
          Is he sincere about wanting peace?

                     DEANNA
          I don't know.
               (she stops him)
          Sir, the strongest sense I had was
          that he's more than curious about
          you.  He very much wants to know
          you.
               (she looks at him deeply)
          The same way you want to know him.

                     PICARD
          How could I not?

                     DEANNA
          Captain, don't assume he's anything
          like you are.  You should resist
          the urge to think you know him.

                     PICARD
          I not only know him, Deanna, I am
          him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

                     DEANNA
          Will, you need to rest.
               (he continues to work)
          As ship's counselor, I'm
          recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

                     RIKER
          Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

                     DEANNA
          We have time.
               (she kisses him)
          Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

                     RIKER
          Imzadi, what am I going to do with
          you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

                     SHINZON
          Imzadi.  This is so good.

                     DEANNA
          No!

He caresses her face...

                     SHINZON
          He can never know you as I know
          you... He can never touch you as I
          touch you.

                     DEANNA
          This isn't real.

                     SHINZON
          Can you feel my hands... are they
          real?  Can you feel my lips, my
          loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

                     SHINZON
          I'll always be with you now.  Now
          and forever...

                     DEANNA
          You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

                     RIKER
          Deanna?!  What's with the name
          calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

                     SURAN
          ... then I don't understand the
          reason for the delay!

                     SHINZON
          You don't have to understand.

                     SURAN
          And bringing the Enterprise here?!
          What possible purpose could that
          serve?!

                     SHINZON
          I have a purpose.

                     SURAN
          Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

                     SHINZON
          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

                     SURAN
               (carefully bows his head)
          Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          Now go.  I have some personal
          business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

                     SHINZON
          Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
          can't stand it.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

                     SHINZON
          It's not quite the face you
          remember.

                     PICARD
          Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

                     SHINZON
          A lifetime of violence will do
          that.  My nose was broken four
          times.  And my jaw... But so much
          is the same.  The eyes, you
          recognize the eyes.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  The eyes have it.

                     SHINZON
          Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
          they?  Yours are so confident.

                     PICARD
          How did you end up on Remus?

                     SHINZON
          They sent me there to die.  How
          could a mere human survive the
          dilithium mines?  It was...
               (he can't find the words)
          ... I was a slave.  And a monster.
          The only thing the Romulan guards
          hated more than the Remans was me.
          But one man took pity on me: the
          man who became my Viceroy.  He
          taught me how to survive.  And in
          that dark place, where there was
          nothing of myself, I found my Reman
          brothers.  They showed me the only
          kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

                     SHINZON
          For thousands of years the Romulan
          Senate has met in this chamber and
          dictated the fate of its sister-
          planet... But the time has come for
          us to live as equals.

                     PICARD
          You're doing this to liberate the
          Remans?

                     SHINZON
          No race should be a slave to
          another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

                     SHINZON
          You don't trust me.

                     PICARD
          I have no reason to.

                     SHINZON
          Of course you do.  If you had lived
          my life and experienced the
          suffering of my people... you'd be
          sitting where I am now.  At least I
          hope you would.

                     PICARD
          And if you had lived my life you
          would understand that there is a
          great responsibility in
          representing the Federation.  I
          can't let my personal feelings
          unduly influence my decisions.

                     SHINZON
          All I have is my personal feelings.
          I wasn't raised with the ideals of
          the Federation.  But I'm trying to
          understand them now.  To live up to
          them   To live up to you.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          I want to know where I come from.
          The Remans gave me a future.  You
          can tell me about my past.

                     PICARD
          There's so much, and so much of it
          is dull...

                     SHINZON
          Were we always explorers?

                     PlCARD
          No.  I was the first Picard to
          leave Earth.  It caused quite a
          stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
          whole life...

                     SHINZON
               (finishing the sentence)
          Looking up at the stars.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you dreamed about what was up
          there.  About...

                     PICARD
               (finishing the sentence)
          New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

                     PICARD
          After you, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

                     PICARD
          So I'm not as tall as you expected?

                     SHINZON
          I always hoped I would hit two
          meters.

                     PICARD
          With a full head of hair.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          There is that.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
          you.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

                     PICARD
          If there's one ideal the Federation
          holds most dear it's that all men,
          all races, can be united.  From the
          first time the Vulcans came to
          Earth we've sought a future of
          peace.  Nothing would make me more
          proud than to take your hand in
          friendship.  In time.  When trust
          has been earned.

                     SHINZON
          I'm honored to think I might
          someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          In time, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

                     VICEROY
          This is a mistake.

                     SHINZON
          He's gentler than I thought.  And
          he has a sense of humor.

                     VICEROY
               (stern)
          Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
          We should act.  Now.  Time is
          running out.

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          My time.  I'll spend it how I
          choose.

A tense beat.

                     SHINZON
          We'll return to the Scimitar.
          Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

                     PICARD
          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

                     GEORDI
          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Set up a security program to detect
          any unusual data stream rerouting.
          If it happens again, we want to be
          ready.

                     GEORDI
               (grim)
          There's something else.  I was
          reviewing the sensor logs...
               (he refers to some
                readouts on his console)
          When the Scimitar decloaked there
          was a momentary spike in the
          tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
          not going to believe this but it's
          Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

                     PICARD
          ... I thought Thalaron radiation
          was theoretical.

                     GEORDI
          Which is why our initial scans
          didn't pick it up.  But he's got
          it, Captain.

                     PICARD
          As I remember, Thalaron research
          was banned in the Federation
          because of its bioqenic properties.

                     BEVERLY
          It has the ability to consume
          organic material at the subatomic
          level.  I can't overestimate the
          danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
          Luc.  A microscopic amount could
          kill every living thing on this
          ship in a matter of seconds.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
          know what he has and how to
          neutralize any threat.  Give me
          options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

                     DATA
          Doctor, will you excuse us for a
          moment?  Geordi, please come with
          me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

                     PICARD
          Come...
               (Beverly enters)
          ... Beverly, come in.

                     BEVERLY
          You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Remember him?

                     BEVERLY
          He was a bit proud as I recall.

                     PICARD
          He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
          ambitious.  Very much in need of
          seasoning.

                     BEVERLY
          He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

                     DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
          I have identified the source of the
          unauthorized computer access.  And,
          I believe, we have also discovered
          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          On my way...

                     BEVERLY
               (stands)
          Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
          right now you're the man you've
          made yourself.  He's someone else.

                     PICARD
          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

                     DEANNA
          You're not here.

                     SHINZON
               (moving to her)
          Very logical, Deanna... But your
          heart doesn't constrain itself to
          mere logic.
               (he caresses her)
          ... Your heart longs to discover
          me.  To know me...
               (he kisses her)
          ... To leave all of this behind and
          be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

                     DEANNA
          No...

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your hunger to know the
          Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

                     SHINZON
          Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

                     VICEROY
          The bond is broken.

                     SHINZON
          Find her again.

                     VICEROY
          No -- this is wasting time.

                     SHINZON
          Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

                     REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
          Praetor, we've received the
          transponder signal.

                     SHINZON
               (to comm)
          On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

                     VICEROY
          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

                     BEVERLY
          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,
          you're completely normal.

                     PICARD
               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

                     DEANNA
          It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

                     DEANNA
               (with difficulty)
          Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
          ability to reach into my thoughts.
          I've become a liability... I
          request to be relieved of my
          duties.

                     PICARD
          Permission denied.  If you can
          possibly endure any more of these
          assaults.  I need you at my side.
          Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

                     RIKER
               (to comm)
          Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

                     SHINZON
          Hello, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Why am I here?

                     SHINZON
          I was lonely...
               (he realizes Picard is
                staring at the veins on
                his face)
          Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
          you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

                     PICARD
               (resists)
          What are you doing?

                     SHINZON
          I need a sample of your blood.
          What do your Borg friends say?
          Resistance is futile.
               (maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
          I learned there might be an
          existing prototype from a
          Cardassian historian, then went to
          a great deal of trouble to find it
          and scatter it about on Kolarus
          III.  I knew it would pique your
          curiosity and conveniently make the
          Enterprise the closest ship to
          Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

                     PICARD
          All of this so you could capture
          me?

                     SHINZON
          Don't be so vain.  After we found
          it, we made a few modifications.
          An extra memory port, a hidden
          transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
          will be a bit less confident when
          you learn I've gained access to
          Starfleet's communications
          protocols.  I now know the location
          of your entire fleet...
               (to B-9)
          ... You may go.

                     B-9
          Where?

                     SHINZON
          Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

                     SHINZON
          Maybe I'll train it to do little
          tricks for me like your robot does.
          Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
          off.

                     PICARD
          What's this all about?

                     SHINZON
          It's about destiny, Picard.  About
          a Reman outcast who --

                     PICARD
          You're not Reman.

                     SHINZON
          And I'm not quite human.  So what
          am I?  What do you see?
               (he peers at Picard
                deeply)
          Do you see a life you might have
          led?  Lost youth never to be
          recaptured?

                     PICARD
          I see a young man trying
          desperately to deny who he is.

                     SHINZON
          I see an old man, set in his ways,
          afraid to live without a uniform to
          prop him up and a Starfleet
          regulation to tell him what to do.
          I see the man I will never be.

                     PICARD
          I won't defend my life to you.

                     SHINZON
          My life is meaningless as long as
          you're alive.  What am I while you
          exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

                     PICARD
               (stern)
          If your issues are with me... This
          has nothing to do with my ship and
          nothing to do with the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
          bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
          the Romulans and not your mighty
          Federation.  We're a race bred for
          war.  For conquest.

                     PICARD
          Think about what you're doing,
          Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
          the entire quadrant into war to
          satisfy your own personal demons?

                     SHINZON
          It amazes me how little you know
          yourself.

                     PICARD
          I'm incapable of such an act, and
          so are you.

                     SHINZON
          I think the facts speak for
          themselves.  The same noble Picard
          blood runs in our veins.  Had you
          lived my life, you'd be doing
          exactly as I am.  Look in the
          mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

                     SHINZON
          Consider that, Captain.  I can
          think of no greater torment for
          you.

He turns to go.

                     PICARD
          It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

                     SHINZON
          Not for long, Captain.
               (back to Picard)
          I'm afraid you won't survive to
          witness the victory of the echo
          over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

                     WORF
          No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

                     GEORDI
               (frustrated)
          His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
          emissions, no residual antiprotons.

                     RIKER
          Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

                     BEVERLY
          Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

                     B-9
               (to Reman guard)
          I am to take the prisoner to the
          Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

                     B-9
          If you resist, I will incapacitate
          you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

                     VICEROY
               (to B-9)
          Where are you taking him?

                     B-9
          Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
          bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

                     VICEROY
          So, human... you've met your better
          self!

                     PICARD
          What are you doing to Counsellor
          Troi?

                     VICEROY
          I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
          sooth him as she soothes you.  To
          stand at his side as she does at
          yours.

                     PICARD
          That will never happen.

                     VICEROY
          Listen to him, android.  Such a
          small and weak creature.  Yet he
          roars so valiantly...
               (he raises one taloned
                claw and puts a sharp
                fingernail on Picard's
                chest)
          It would take me but an instant to
          tear that valiant heart from your
          chest.

                     PICARD
          There'll be another after me.  And
          another after that.  You'll find
          we're a resilient species.

                     VICEROY
          I look forward to the sport.
               (to the B-9, harshly)
          Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

                     B-9
          Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

                     PICARD
               (whispers)
          Be careful of over-playing your
          part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
          touch of reality to the
          performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

                     DATA
          My mission was a success, sir.  I
          have discovered the source of the
          Thalaron radiation.

                     PICARD
          Good work.  The download?

                     DATA
          He believes he has our
          communications protocols.  But they
          will give him inaccurate locations
          for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

                     DATA
          Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

                     PICARD
          A bit less florid, Data.

                     DATA
          Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

                     DATA
          This entire ship is, essentially, a
          flying Thalaron generator.
               (he points up)
          All its power relays lead to that
          device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

                     PICARD
          A weapon.

                     DATA
          It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

                     DATA
          Geordi equipped me with the
          prototype for the Emergency
          Transport Unit.  I recommend you
          use it to return to the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          It'll only work for one of us.

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.

                     PICARD
          We'll find a way off together.
          Recommendations?

                     DATA
          There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
          from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

                     VICEROY
          Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

                     DATA
          This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

                     DATA
               (looking at door security
                panel)
          It seems to have an encrypted
          security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

                     PICARD
          Alacrity would be appreciated,
          Commander.

                     DATA
          They are trying to override the
          access codes.  Reman is really a
          most complex language with
          pictographs representing certain
          verb roots and --

                     PICARD
          While I find that fascinating,
          Data, we really need that Goddamned
          door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

                     DATA
          According to the ship's manifest
          they are Scorpion-class attack
          fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

                     PICARD
               (trying to figure out the
                controls)
          What do you imagine this is?

                     DATA
          Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
          like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

                     PICARD
          Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
          They have instigated security
          overrides and erected a force field
          around the external portals.

                     PICARD
          Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

                     DATA
          Do you think this is a wise course
          of action?

                     PICARD
          We're about to find out... Power up
          disruptors and fire on my mark.

                     DATA
          Ready, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

                     SHINZON
          Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

                     SHINZON
          The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
          won't make it back to Federation
          space.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (angry)
          This has gone far enough!

                     SHINZON
          I thought we discussed patience,
          Commander.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          And mine is wearing thin, young
          man!  We supported you because you
          promised action.  And yet you delay
          and you waste your time playing
          games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic 
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Suran, the games are
          over.  In two days the Federation
          will be crippled beyond repair.
          Does that satisfy you?

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (grim)
          For the moment.

                     SHINZON
               (brutal)
          And when I return... you and I
          shall have a little talk about
          showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

                     DONATRA
          Does anyone in this room harbor any
          illusions about what he means by
          "showing proper respect"?

                     TAL'AURA
          What's happening to his face?

                     SURAN
          I want opinions.  He is clearly out
          of his mind.

                     SURAN
          But can he complete his mission?

                     DONATRA
          Should he?

They look at her.

                     DONATRA
          Are you prepared to have your hands
          drenched in blood?  He'll show them
          no mercy.  And his sins will mark
          us all for generations.  Is that
          what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

                     DONATRA
          I think you should consider that
          question now -- or else you may
          have a lifetime to think about it
          in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

                     BEVERLY
          The more I studied his DNA the more
          confusing it got.  Finally I could
          only come to one conclusion...
          Shinzon was created with temporal
          RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
          that at a certain point his aging
          process could be accelerated to
          reach your age more quickly, so he
          could replace you.

                     PICARD
          But the Romulans abandoned the
          plan...

                     BEVERLY
          As a result the temporal sequencing
          was never activated.  Remember, he
          was supposed to replace you at
          nearly your current age.  He was
          engineered to skip thirty years of
          life.  But since the RNA sequencing
          was never activated, his cellular
          structure has started to break
          down.  He's dying.

                     PICARD
          Dying?

                     RIKER
          He wasn't designed to live a
          complete, human life span.

                     PlCARD
          Can anything be done for him?

                     BEVERLY
          Not without a complete
          myelodysplastic infusion from the
          only donor with compatible DNA.
          But that would mean draining all
          your blood.

                     RIKER
          That's why he went to all that
          trouble to capture you.

                     PlCARD
          How long does he have?

                     BEVERLY
          I can't be sure but the rate of
          decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
          Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

                     B-9
          Brother.  I cannot move.

                     DATA
          No, I have only activated your
          cognitive and communication
          subroutines.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because you are dangerous.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          You have been programmed to gather
          information that can be used
          against this ship.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     DATA
          I know.

A beat.

                     DATA
          Do you know anything about
          Shinzon's plans against the
          Federation?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Do you have any knowledge of the
          tactical abilities of his ship?

                     B-9
          No.  Can I move now?

                     DATA
          No.  I must deactivate you.

                     B-9
          For how long?

                     DATA
          Indefinitely.

                     B-9
          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

                     RIKER
          Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
          Federation is crippled...

                     PICARD
          And the Romulans invade.

                     DEANNA
          How can you be certain?

                     PICARD
          I know how he thinks.

A beat.

                     RIKER
               (to Geordi)
          And there's no way to penetrate his
          cloak?

                     GEORDI
          No, sir.

                     RIKER
               (frustrated)
          He could pass within 10 meters of
          every ship in Starfleet and they'd
          never know.

                     BEVERLY
          But we do have one advantage.
               (to Picard)
          He needs your blood to live.  He
          might come after you first.

                     PICARD
          I'm counting on it... We've been
          ordered to head to sector 3274.
          Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
          meet us there.

                     RIKER
          Strength in numbers?

                     PICARD
          We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

                     PICARD
          He can't be allowed to use that
          weapon.  All other concerns are
          secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

                     RIKER
          Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

                     PICARD
          All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Personal Log.
          Supplemental.  We're heading toward
          Federation space at maximum warp.
          The crew has responded with the
          dedication I've come to expect of
          them.  And like a thousand other
          commanders on a thousand other
          battlefields throughout history, I
          wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          To seek out new life and new
          civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's
          own words.  When Charles Darwin set
          out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his
          journey into the unknown... he
          sailed without a single musket.

                     BEVERLY
               (gently)
          That was another time.

                     PICARD
          How far we've come.  Let me know if
          you need anything.

He starts to go --

                     BEVERLY
          Jean Luc...
               (he stops)
          ... He is not you.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          What makes us who we are, Doctor?
          Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

                     SHINZON
          How long?

                     VICEROY
          A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

                     VICEROY
          If you don't begin the procedure
          soon you'll never make it back to
          Romulus.  You shouldn't have
          delayed.  You should have killed
          Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

                     SHINZON
          How long until we reach the Rift?

                     VICEROY
               (checks a console)
          Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

                     PICARD
          Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          How long until we reach the fleet?

                     DATA
          At our current velocity we will
          arrive at sector 3274 in
          approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          "For now we see but through a glass
          darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

                     DATA
          Of you?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     DATA
          I do not agree.  Although you share
          the same genetic structure, the
          events of your life have created
          unique individual.

                     PICARD
          But so much is the same.  On a
          biological level he is... and I
          will not accept the idea that there
          is nothing I can do.  I have a
          responsibility to try to make a
          human connection with him.

                     DATA
          He would deny a "human" connection
          is possible.  He considers himself
          entirely Reman.

                     PICARD
          He may have already rejected my
          humanity, but you also have a twin.

                     DATA
          No, sir, it is not possible.  The
          B-9 is physically identical to me,
          although his neural pathways are
          not as advanced.  But even if they
          were, he would not be me.

                     PICARD
          How can you be sure?

                     DATA
          I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
          am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
          Shinzon.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We'll never know what Shinzon might
          have been.  Had he stood where I
          did as a child?  And looked up at
          the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          We are passing through the Bassen
          Rift.  The projections will return
          when we have cleared it.

                     PICARD
          It's interfering with our uplink
          from Starfleet cartography?

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
          long-range communications --

                     PICARD
                (urgent, to comm)
          Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

                     SHINZON
          Target weapons systems and shields.
          I don't want the Enterprise
          destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

                     SHINZON
          Can you learn to see in the dark,
          Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

                     PICARD
          Report.

                     RIKER
          He's firing through his cloak.  We
          can't get a lock.

                     GEORDI
               (at engineering station)
          He disabled our warp drive with his
          first shot.  We've only got
          impulse.

                     WORF
          Long range communication is
          impossible as long as we're in the
          rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

                     PICARD
          Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
          zero elevation.  All banks on my
          mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
          stand by photon torpedoes.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but
pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields
were momentarily illuminated.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          You're too slow, old man.
               (entering commands in his
                chair console)
          Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

                     DATA
          We are losing dorsal shields --

                     PICARD
          Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
          all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

INT.  ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     WORF
          Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

          Counselor Troi, report to the
          bridge.

                     RIKER
          Unless we can disable his cloak
          we're just going to be firing in
          the dark.

                     PlCARD
          Agreed.

                     WORF
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

                     SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, will you join me in
          your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

                     SHINZON
          You can't trace my holographic
          emitters, Captain.  So don't
          bother.  And you can't contact
          Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

                     PICARD
          We are.

                     SHINZON
          It's just the two of us now, Jean
          Luc, as it should be... Your ship
          and mine... You and me.

                     PICARD
          Why are you here?

                     SHINZON
          To accept your surrender.  I can
          clearly destroy you at any time.
          Lower your shields and allow me to
          transport you to my ship.

                     PICARD
          And what of the Enterprise?

                     SHINZON
          I have little interest in your
          quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
          Enterprise will withdraw to a
          distance of one hundred light
          years, it will not be harmed.

                     PICARD
          You know that's not possible.

                     SHINZON
          I know... you'll all gladly die to
          save your home world.

                     PICARD
               (intense)
          Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
          the blood pumping inside you?  Your
          hands, your eyes, your nature, are
          the same as mine.  Buried deep
          inside you beneath the years of
          pain and anger is a capacity you've
          forgotten.  It's the one way our
          mirror can reflect the two of us
          exactly because it's the very thing
          that truly defines us.  To be human
          is to try to make yourself better
          than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

                     PICARD
          I know you as well as I know
          myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
          you looked at the stars and dreamed
          of what might be.

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          Long ago.

                     PICARD
          Not so long.

                     SHINZON
          Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
          the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
          what you see now.

                     PICARD
          I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

                     PICARD
          I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

                     PICARD
          The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
          Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
          the population of an entire planet!
          He is better than that!

                     SHINZON
               (desperate)
          He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

                     PICARD
          And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

                     PICARD
          If I were to beam to your ship...
          let you complete your medical
          procedure, give you a full life...
          what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

                     PICARD
          You once asked me about your past.
          Your history.  When I was your age,
          I burned with ambition.  I was very
          proud and my pride often hurt
          people.  I made every wrong choice
          a young man can... But one thing
          saved me... I had a father who
          believed in me.  Who took the time
          to teach me a better way.  You have
          the same father.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.

                     PICARD
          So if I gave you my life, what
          would you do with it?  Would you
          spend the years in a blaze of
          hatred as you are now?  Or could
          you change?  Could you try to
          remember a mother's touch you never
          felt?  A father's words you never
          heard?  Could you do that?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I don't know.

                     PICARD
          But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

                     PICARD
          Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

                     SHINZON
          That's your life... not mine.

                     PICARD
          Please.

                     SHINZON
          It's too late.

                     PICARD
          You can still make a choice!  Make
          the right one now!

                     SHINZON
          I have no choices!  I can't fight
          what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

                     SHINZON
          I'll show you my true nature.  Your
          nature.  And as Earth dies --
          remember that I'm forever Shinzon
          of Remus!  And my voice will echo
          through time long after yours has
          faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

                     SHINZON
          Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

                     SHINZON
          Report!

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Two ships decloaking, sir!
          Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

                     RIKER
          Believe it or not, I think the
          cavalry has arrived.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
          of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
          be of assistance?

                     PICARD
          Your timing is impeccable,
          Commander.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          The Empire considers this a matter
          of internal security.  We regret
          you've become involved.

                     PICARD
          When this is over, I owe you a
          drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
          work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          You heard the lady.  Get to work.
          Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

                     SHINZON
          Target the flanking Warbird.  All
          forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

          Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
          aft port quadrant and prepare for
          full emergency stop.

                     VICEROY
               (startled)
          What?!

                     SHINZON
          You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

                     DONATRA
          She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
          all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     VICEROY
          She's almost on us.

                     SHINZON
          Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

                     VICEROY
          Praetor...

                     SHINZON
          FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
          about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I'm afraid that drink will have to
          wait, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Do you have life support?

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          For the moment.  But we're dead in
          the water.

                     PICARD
          Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     DATA
          We have lost structural integrity
          on decks twelve through seventeen,
          sections four through ten.

                     GEORDI
          Emergency force fields are holding.

                     RIKER
          Evacuate those decks and reroute
          field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

                     DEANNA
          Captain -- I might have a way to
          find them.

                     PICARD
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          The one thing he may have forgotten
          in the course of battle: me.

                     PICARD
          Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

                     SHINZON
          Prepare a lateral run -- all
          starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

                     VICEROY
          No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

                     DEANNA
          He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

                     SHINZON
          What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

                     VICEROY
          She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

                     DEANNA
          Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

                     DEANNA
          NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

                     PICARD
          Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

                     SHINZON
               (spinning to his Viceroy)
          Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
          ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

                     SHINZON
          Get the cloak back!  And target
          shield coordinates beta three.  All
          disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                     DATA
          Captain, we have lost ventral
          shielding on deck twenty nine.

                     PICARD
          Divert power and compensate --

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

                     WORF
          Intruder alert!

                     RIKER
          Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

                     WORF
               (to comm)
          Security detail to deck twenty
          nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

                     RIKER
          Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

                     GEORDI
          He's getting his cloak back.  We
          have exhausted our compliment of
          photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
          down to four percent.

                     PICARD
          What if we target all phasers in a
          concentrated attack?

                     DATA
          The Scimitar's shields are still at
          seventy percent.  It would make no
          difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

                     DEANNA
          They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

                     GEORDI
          What's he doing?

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

                     PICARD
          He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
          going to do...

                     GEORDI
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

                     SHINZON
          Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

                     DATA
          We are being hailed.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, stand by.
               (to Data)
          Open a channel.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you're still alive, Jean
          Luc.

                     PICARD
          I am.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Don't you think it's time to
          surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
          in a matter of minutes and your
          poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
          should the rest of your crew have
          to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

                     PICARD
          I never told you about my first
          Academy evaluation, did I?  I
          received very high marks for my
          studies.  But I was found lacking
          in certain other areas.
          Personality traits, you might say.
          In particular I was thought to be
          extremely...
               (he glares up at the prow
                of the Scimitar)
          ... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

                     PICARD
               (quickly)
          Geordi, put 211 power to the
          engines.  Take it from life support
          if you have to -- everything you
          can give me.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, on my mark.

                     GEORDI
          Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

                     PICARD
               (on comm)
          All hands, brace for impact!
               (to Deanna)
          ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

                     SHINZON
          HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

                     SHINZON
          Divert all power to engines.  Full
          reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

                     RIKER
          Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
          voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
          Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
          Zero Five --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          What about Picard?

                     SHINZON
          Our greater goal is more important,
          brother.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          But, Praetor, you won't survive
          without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

                     SHINZON
          Some ideals are worth dying for,
          aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

                     PICARD
          How long until he can fire?

                     GEORDI
          The targeting sequence should take
          about four minutes.

                     DEANNA
          But how can he?  He'll kill you.

                     PICARD
          This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

                     PICARD
          Prepare for a site-to-site
          transport.

                     GEORDI
               (concerned)
          Sir, we won't be able to bring you
          back.  It's a one way trip.
          Captain, I don't know if the
          transporter --

                     PICARD
          That's an order, Commander.

                     DATA
          Sir, allow me to go.  You are
          needed here.

                     PICARD
          Negative.

                     DATA
          Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

                     DEANNA
          Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          You have the bridge, Commander.
          Use all available power to move
          away from the Scimitar.
               (to Geordi)
          Now, Mister La Forge.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

                     GEORDI
          That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

                     DATA
          Counsellor Troi, please assume
          command.  Geordi, if you will come
          with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

                     DATA
          What is our approximate distance?

                     GEORDI
               (scans with tricorder)
          400 meters.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

                     DATA
          Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
          field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

                     COMPUTER (V.O)
          Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

                     SHINZON
          I'm glad we're together now -- our
          destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

                     DATA
          Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

                     DEANNA
          Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

                     GEORDI
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen...
               (he remembers there is no
                longer a viewscreen)
          ... Open a channel.

                     DONATRA (V.O.)
          This is Commander Donatra of the
          Valdore.  We're dispatching
          shuttles with medical personnel and
          supplies.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (flat)
          Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
          for arrivals.  They don't know our
          procedures so just... open the
          doors.

                     GEORDI
          I'll take care of it, sir.

                     PICARD
          Number One.
               (a beat)
          You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

                     PICARD
          To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

                     PICARD
          I don't know if all this has made
          sense to you, but I wanted you to
          know what kind of man he was.  In
          his quest to be more like us, he
          helped show us what it means to be
          human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

                     B-9
          My brother was not a human.

                     PICARD
          No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
          his curiosity about every facet of
          human life helped all of us see the
          best parts of ourselves.  He
          embraced change... because he
          always wanted to be more than he
          was.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     PICARD
          Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
          to tow us to spacedock.

                     PICARD
          On my way.  Please notify Commander
          Riker...
               (he stands, prepares to
                go)
          ... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

                     B-9
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

                     PICARD
          I'm sorry you won't be here for the
          re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
          you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

                     PICARD
          The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
          she's getting a captain worthy of
          her.

                     RIKER
          She's the most beautiful ship I've
          ever seen.
               (he touches a wall of the
                corridor)
          ... But she's not the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          I promise you in time, she'll
          become your home... If I could
          offer you one piece of advice?

                     RIKER
          Anything.

                     PICARD
          When your first officer insists
          that you can't go on away
          missions... Ignore him --

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          I intend to.

A moment.

                     RIKER
               (with difficulty)
          Serving with you has been an honor.

                     PICARD
          The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

                     MADDEN
          So... what's the old man like?

                     OPS OFFICER
          Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
          They're kids!  All with advance
          degrees in xenobiology and out to
          conquer every disease in the
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Reminds me of a young doctor I used
          to know...

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          They're running me ragged.  Nothing
          but questions day and night... I
          love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
          tell you all about it.  There's a
          Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

                     PICARD
          Not tonight, I have work here.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Soon then.  I'll save the last
          dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

                     MADDEN
          Commander Martin Madden reporting
          for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

                     PICARD
          Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
          your transfer didn't come as too
          much of a surprise.

                     MADDEN
          I was... honored, sir.

                     PICARD
          I needed you immediately to help
          oversee the re-fit...
               (gathering up some padds
                from his desk)
          ... Your service record on the
          Talos is exemplary, but there are a
          few things I would like to discuss
          with you regarding my requirements
          for a First Officer.  Shall we say
          dinner in my quarters at 1900
          hours?

                     MADDEN
          Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

                     PICARD
          Commander, I don't know how they
          did it on the Talos, but we have
          door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
          use them.

                     MADDEN
          Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

                     WORF
          You don't understand the Captain --
          there should be no changes until we
          have discussed the modifications
          with him.

Picard goes to them:

                     PICARD
          What's this?

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          Your new chair, sir.

                     ENSIGN
          It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
          State-of-the-art ergonomics...
          command interfaces with --

                     WORF
          I told him you're comfortable with
          your old chair.

                     PICARD
          Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

                     PICARD
          Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

                     ENSIGN
               (points)
          Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

                     PICARD
          It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

                     PICARD
          Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

                     PICARD
          ... We've received our first
          assignment.  We're going to be
          exploring the Denab system.  It
          should be exciting.  It's a
          place... where no one has gone
          before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

                     B-9 (V.O.)
          "Never saw the sun shining so
          bright, Never saw things going so
          right.  Noticing the days hurrying
          by, When you're in love, my how
          they fly.  Blue days, all of them
          gone, Nothing but blue skies from
          now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

                                                FADE OUT.
