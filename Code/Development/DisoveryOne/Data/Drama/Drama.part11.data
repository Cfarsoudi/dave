"Man On Fire"

OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT.   MEXICO CITY - DAY

High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun
pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a Mass being sung.

A CATHOLIC CHURCH

The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...

A GRAND MARQUIS

Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a
moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...

The Grand Marquis pulls away.

INT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY

They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.
These guys are not the police.

A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.

Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.

EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY

The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW
GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His
clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He
stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over
from one group to the other.

INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY

The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's
distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall)
answers.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    2.


REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in
the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers
at him as the negotiations begin.

INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY

A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his
leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK
RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.

A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.

At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA
newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime
syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last
two years."

EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY

As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A
glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear
partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.

EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father
waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender
flag.

EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)

Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown
neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt
out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to
the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the
footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He
slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.

EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT

RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a
white stream of taillights by a narrow median.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        3.


HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded,
is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.

He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING
for help. More horns, shouts, no help.

END MAIN TITLES.   Goes to black.

                          CREASY'S VOICE
             Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the
             name of charity and good will shepherds
             the weak through the valley of darkness
             for he is truly his brother's keeper and
             the finder of lost children.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the
privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well
connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40,
already has the patrician look that has served the male
members of his family for generations. They discuss the
kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.

                          JORDAN
             The family paid the ransom and he was
             returned two days later.
                    (laughs; chews)
             His father still hasn't gotten up the
             nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
             the ass.

                          SAMUEL
             And now every mother with money in Mexico
             City wants bigger and better bodyguards.
             My own wife included.

                          JORDAN
             If she pisses you off, you get another one.

                          SAMUEL
                    (laughs grimly)
             Do you know what she told me last night?

                                                 FLASH TO:

INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle
rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands
away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a
pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       4.


                          LISA
             A man's worth can be judged by what he
             has or what he owes. Only the amount
             matters.

                          SAMUEL
             And bankruptcy. Where will that put me
             in the social strata?

                          LISA
             I'm only asking for one thing. And it's
             not an extravagance. It's not even for
             me; it's for our daughter.

                             SAMUEL
             Our daughter.

She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese
Checkers.

                          LISA
             Our child's safety is at stake.

                          SAMUEL
                    (stops playing)
             These people are professionals. They
             don't waste their time taking children
             whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

                          LISA
             Samuel, it is not something we should
             skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the
             car or outside the school was at least
             some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I
             feel totally exposed.

She just stares at him.    He melts.

                                                  RETURN TO:

INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.

                          SAMUEL
             Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be
             as beautiful as her mother one day.

                           JORDAN
             Yeah?   And if she was ugly?

Samuel rolls his eyes. Jordan laughs.       Beheading two
cigars, he passes one to Samuel.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                5.


                         JORDAN
            All my clients have kidnap and ransom
            insurance.

                         SAMUEL
            I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and
            my family and when it runs out in sixty
            days, without a bodyguard, I will not be
            able to renew it.

                         JORDAN
            I know you need to please Lisa. An ass
            like that is hard to find. Good
            bodyguards are even harder.

                         SAMUEL
                   (interrupts)
            I know! I just had to let one go because
            I couldn't afford him!

Jordan lights his cigar.

                         JORDAN
            You need a bodyguard of some description.
            It's a dangerous world we live in. But
            you will get what you pay for. He
            doesn't need to be Superman, does he?
            Can you go fifteen grand?

                           SAMUEL
            For a year?

                         JORDAN
            For a few months. Hire someone cheap.
            You have to have a bodyguard to keep the
            insurance. Then fire him for
            incompetence. The important thing is
            Lisa's daughter will return to school.

Samuel finally follows the logic.

                         SAMUEL
            And Lisa will be able to save face.    We
            won't be the only family without a
            bodyguard.

                         JORDAN
            Her beauty fucks with your mind.

                         SAMUEL
            For an American she understands this
            country very well.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   6.


                           JORDAN
              She understands men.

As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...

EXT.    CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAY

As a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at
us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an
air of isolation. He's set apart from other living
things.

He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather
bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening.
The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a
gunslinger.

Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light).
Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs
card. Light flashes RED.

CUSTOMS MAN

He flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have
stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong
Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's
been around.

Customs looks up from the ink blue American Eagle to the
deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses.

NOTE:    Italics denotes the lines spoken in Spanish.

                           CUSTOMS
              Where are you coming from?

                           CREASY
              South America.

                           CUSTOMS
              Where are you staying in Mexico?

                           CREASY
              I'm on to Juarez.

                           CUSTOMS
              Why?

                           CREASY
              I have a friend there.

Customs looks at Creasy a moment. He doesn't look like a
man who has 'friends'. Finally, customs smiles.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   7.


                          CUSTOMS
             I cannot see your eyes, Senor.

Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted.
Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment.
He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor
belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag
onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button.
The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.

Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.

                             CUSTOMS
             Senor?

                          CREASY
             It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.
             The gun you're about to find in that
             suitcase.

Polaroid FLASH

Shot of Creasy straight on.     Shot of Creasy profile.

FLASH.   Fingers being fingerprinted.

JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels,
glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with
seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts
of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of
suitcase.

The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a
well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.

EXT. JUAREZ, MEXICO FOUR BIG BURLY SUV'S - DRIVING
ACROSS THE BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY

INT. SUV - DAY

Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. PAUL
RAYBURN sits up front trying not to spill coffee on the
mini Uzi cradled in his lap. As his own cell phone
rings, he answers.

                             RAYBURN
             Rayburn here.

INT. CUSTOMS HOLDING TANK - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy on payphone.

               When did Mexican Customs start getting
               smart?

RAYBURN's SUV

                             RAYBURN
               Creasy???   Where the fuck are you?

CUSTOMS JAIL

                             CREASY
               I'm here.

RAYBURN's SUV

                            RAYBURN
               What do you mean, I'm here?

CUSTOMS JAIL

                            CREASY
               I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico
               City International. Bring a bunch of
               cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.

INT. CUSTOMS AREA - A BACK OFFICE
Rayburn has 5K U.S. dollars laid out on      the desk between
him, the Customs official, and Creasy.       The remains of
the suitcase are spread around the room.       The main
offender, the gun being front and center      next to the
cash. Looks like the official is going       to fold.

                            RAYBURN
               This is going to cost you big time.

INT. STRIP BAR - Rethink Location

A stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and
Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'.

                            RAYBURN
               You got a secondary search and you had a
               gun.

                            CREASY
               Listen it was a calculated risk. I've
               done it a million times and never got
               caught.

                            RAYBURN
               Everything happens once if you live long
               enough.

                         CREASY
            It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags
            coming off the plane.

                         RAYBURN
            This is Mexico, they do everything
            backwards.

Creasy hits the 'Jack'.

                         RAYBURN
            So what's wrong?

                         CREASY
            Nothing wrong.

                         RAYBURN
            Don't give me that bullshit.

Creasy changes subject.

                         CREASY
            So how's business?

                         RAYBURN
            Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap
            labor. Factory space. But they feel a
            lot safer living over the border in El
            Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They
            think I'm John-fucking-Wayne.

                         CREASY
            But don't you stay in El Paso?

                         RAYBURN
            Fuck, I love Mexico.   I live like a king
            down here.

Creasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar.

                         CREASY
            Yeah, right...

                         RAYBURN
            Oh, like you haven't been in worse
            places.

                         CREASY
            And a level five shithole is better than
            a level six. Your logic's inescapable.

Rayburn laughs. Creasy takes the bottle.     Creasy's hand
is mottled by old burn marks.

                            RAYBURN
               You been working?

                            CREASY
               Not for eight months. I was in Columbia
               looking around, but, nothing seemed
               interesting.

                            RAYBURN
               How long you staying, Crease?

                            CREASY
                      (shrugs)
               Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just
               wanted to see you, how you were. Came by
               on impulse.

Rayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks
that weren't there last time they met.

                            RAYBURN
               You did something on impulse?

Creasy smiles.

INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Nine-year-old PINTA MARTIN RAMOS stares out at the
garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare.
Pinta's eyes brim with life. She folds her hands, closes
her eyes, prays. 'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs.
Samuel on the baby grand.

                            PINTA
               Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or
               wealth. People ask you so often that you
               can't have any left. Give me God what
               you still have. Give me what no one else
               asks for. Amen.

Pinta grabs a battered old TEDDY BEAR and climbs into
bed. She pulls the covers up, looks over as her door
opens.

Lisa enters.    Pinta is her daughter.

                            LISA
               You should be sleeping, baby.

            I'm trying, mom.

Lisa strokes her head, smiles.

                            LISA
            Good news.     You're going back to school.

                          PINTA
                    (sits up; excited)
            When?

                         LISA
            Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard.
            It may take a few days, but you're going
            back.

Pinta lets it sink in.   Lisa kisses her goodnight.

                         PINTA
            Could he speak English?     Emilio couldn't
            speak English.

                        LISA
            We'll see. And thank your father in the
            morning. A man always needs to be
            thanked.

EXT. - JUAREZ DESERT - DAWN

Four SUV's blast along a desert highway on their way to
pick up some Japanese businessmen. Rayburn rides
shotgun, Creasy in the back. Rayburn looks like he slept
in his clothes. Creasy looks crisp and clean.

                         RAYBURN
            That's right, a bodyguard.

Creasy looks at him blankly.

                         RAYBURN
            Your Spanish is good enough.     You
            certainly look the part.

                         CREASY
            You're crazy. People would hire a has-
            been, Ray? A drunk?

                         RAYBURN
            Well, you'd have to keep it under
            control.

                         CREASY
            And what if, just say, there was a kidnap
            attempt?

                         RAYBURN
            You do your best. They won't be paying
            you enough to perform miracles.

Creasy just shakes his head.

                         RAYBURN
            It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at
            half speed you're pretty damn good.

                          CREASY
            A bodyguard has to be close to someone
            all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not
            good at that.

                         RAYBURN
            So you'll be the silent type.    People
            will appreciate that.

Creasy shakes his head, looks out the window.

                         RAYBURN
            What are you doing here?

                         CREASY
            I came to visit you.

                         RAYBURN
            Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years.
            You don't visit.

                         CREASY
            A bodyguard... Who's the guy?

                           RAYBURN
            Samuel Ramos.    Owns one of the plants in
            Juarez. The    Jap car industry is in the
            toilet. He's    trying to persuade Ford to
            partner with   him. I think he's in
            trouble. He    asked me if I knew anyone he
            could trust.

                         CREASY
            Oh, now you think I can be trusted.

                         RAYBURN
            Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air.
            Then decide if you want to... stick
            around or not.

Rayburn throws him a VHS from the glove box.

                          RAYBURN
             Instructional tape on what I tell my
             clients about bodyguarding.

Creasy looks back at Rayburn who's just a little too
perceptive for comfort.

EXT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY SUBURBS - DAY

A dark Mercedes maneuvers the turns.

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy at the wheel.    Samuel sits in the back.   Studying.

                          SAMUEL
             You drive easily. Smoothly.

Creasy doesn't answer, just drives.

                          SAMUEL (CONT'D)
             Were you provided with a gun?

                             CREASY
             Yes.

                          SAMUEL
             Show me, please.

Creasy takes his right hand off the wheel, reaches under
his jacket and passes back a beat-to-shit looking PISTOL.

                             SAMUEL (CONT'D)
             What is it?

                          CREASY
             Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.

                          SAMUEL
             Have you used this type before?

Creasy just nods.   Doesn't like the show and tell.

                             SAMUEL
             Is it loaded?

                             CREASY
             It's loaded.

Samuel hands back the gun.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   14.


                          SAMUEL
             You will meet my wife first. She would
             like it if you are presentable, polite
             and respectful. You'll be the fifth
             candidate she's seen this week.

Samuel flips through a manila folder.

                          SAMUEL
             Your resume is impressive. Nine years in
             the Army. Extensive counter terrorism
             work. I shouldn't be able to afford you
             in my current state. What's the catch?

                          CREASY
                    (honest)
             I drink.

                          SAMUEL
             How does it affect you?

                          CREASY
             My coordination. Reaction time. If top
             professionals try to kidnap your
             daughter, the service will be on par with
             the pay.

                          SAMUEL
             And what if amateurs try it?

                          CREASY
             I'll probably kill them.   Is that likely?

                          SAMUEL
             No. And no one is to know of your
             drinking problem. That includes my wife.

As they pull up to the Ramos' impressive hacienda.

INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Where Lisa is flipping through TV channels; Sky News,
CNN, etc... Each one showing some terrorist act - West
Bank protest, Madrid car bombing.

Samuel and Creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her.      She
clicks it off, looks back at them.

            It's war. The weakest suffer the most.

                         LISA
            You're American.

            Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.

Lisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand.    Gives him a quick
once over.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
            Would you like a drink?

Creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has
no irony in his answer.

                            CREASY
            Thank you.     Scotch and a little water.

She steps to the bar to make it.

CREASY - FROM SOMEONE'S POV

Slightly sinister.   Watching from the frame of the door.

                         LISA
            You've done much of this work before?

                            CREASY
            Never.

Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence.

                         SAMUEL
            He has experience in related work.     A
            great deal of it.

                         LISA
            Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?

Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat.

                          CREASY
            No.   I do not have family.

And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched.        His
eyes flicker over, just in time to see...

PINTA

Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a
beat, then disappears around the corner.

SITTING ROOM

Creasy frowns.    Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink.

                            CREASY
               Thank you.

She makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks
back into hers with complete indifference, something she
has not experienced even from dying men.

She abruptly turns away.    Confused for a moment.
Finally:

                            LISA
               Pinta!

A few moments and Pinta arrives.       'Cool Hand Pinta'.

                            PINTA
               Yes, mom?

                            LISA
               This is Mr. Creasy.

Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand.
Creasy shakes it. An odd beat.

                            LISA
               Pinta, show him to his room.

Samuel reacts.    Creasy got the job.

                            PINTA
               This way, Mr. Creasy.

What an actress. As he follows her out.        Samuel sits at
his baby grand and begins to play.

               I think it's nice he's American.

            You realize that you've brought a killer
            into the house.

Samuel is stopped short by that one.    She steps over and
kisses her husband on the cheek.

                            LISA
            Thank you.     I feel better now.

EXT./INT. HOUSE - SUNSET

Pinta leads the way. All enthusiasm, away from her
parents. A 150 pound black German Shepherd greets them.
Sniffs Creasy's pant leg, unsure.

                         PINTA
            Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?

                         CREASY
            If they like me.

            My Dad loves the idea of having a dog
            around, but hates the fact he lives

Creasy follows her.   Frank pads along after them.

CREASY'S ROOM

Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.

                         PINTA
            We fixed the room up two weeks ago.       Mom
            and I. It's nicer than before.

Creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.

                         PINTA
            You've got a CD player if you like music.
            I like music a lot.

CAW! Creasy looks over at a CAGE on a stand holding a
MACAW. It tilts its head at the big man.

A TV and VHS machine in the corner.

                            PINTA
               That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him
               with when he left.

                               CREASY
               Who's Emilio?

                            PINTA
               My last bodyguard. He drove me to school
               in the morning and picked me up in the
               afternoon.

Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.

                            CREASY
               I'm here for you?

Pinta smiles huge, nods.

               In between you can take Mom shopping and

               Looks like he approves of you.

And then, walking on air, she's out the door.

Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

CREASY'S BAG

He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.

He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?

CAW!   The macaw squawks it's disapproval.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
himself.

His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.

CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.

                          PINTA
             There's something about him.

Lisa turns, looks back at her daughter.

                          PINTA
             I think he's been sick. He's alright

              Well, think about going to sleep.   Good

Lisa exits.   Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear.

                           PINTA
              Just like you, a big old bear.

CREASY

In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins
loading up. The full magazine joins with those already
loaded.

Another glass of scotch is poured.

Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped
in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed.

A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various
routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's
school.

The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the
cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the
cage door.

Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window,
listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night.

Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the
sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going
over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks
underneath...

The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy.
Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro.

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant
beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to
school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The
back of the right one is swirled with scars.

                          PINTA
             Where are you from, Creasy?

                          CREASY
             The United States.

                            PINTA
             I know.    But which state?

Creasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white
TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him.

                          CREASY
             No state in particular.

Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.

                          PINTA
             My mom and me are from Houston, Texas.
             Have you been there?

Creasy has his eyes on the mirror.

                            CREASY
             No.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   22.


                         PINTA
            You can drive and talk at the same time,
            can't you?

                         CREASY
                   (turns left)
            No.

                            PINTA
            Why not?

                         CREASY
            I'm looking for potential.

Creasy checks the mirror. The white Corolla continues
the way it was going. False alarm.

                            PINTA
            Potential?     I don't understand.

                         CREASY
            Places where the road bends, places away
            from buildings, places where the traffic
            thins out. But you don't have to
            understand. I do. So no talking.

                         PINTA
            Are you going to quit?     My last bodyguard
            quit.

                         CREASY
            Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?

                         PINTA
            Someone gave him more money than we
            could.

                         CREASY
            I'm a bargain.

                         PINTA
            Being black, is that a positive or
            negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

                         CREASY
            Time will tell.

                         PINTA
            There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
            in the last six days. Four a day. What
            do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     23.


                          CREASY
             Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my
             fee or get a larger gun.

She looks at his scared right hand, then him.     All
curiosity.

EXT.   CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy pulls the Mercedes up out front.   He notes the
high walls, the heavy gates.

                          PINTA
             Beep the horn.

Creasy hits it. A beat and then a   shutter opens at eye
level. Pinta waves from the car.    A moment later the
gate is being slowly pushed open by  an old WATCHMAN.
Creasy drives in toward a rambling,  ivy-clad building set
in spacious grounds.

COURTYARD

Creasy parks, get out of the car.   He looks around,
appraising the lay of the land.

                          PINTA
             Isn't it beautiful?

Pinta's name is called. An elderly gray-haired NUN walks
over from the entrance. Pinta runs over, kiss her
warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward Creasy.

                          PINTA
             Sister Anna, the headmistress.
                    (to nun; proudly)
             This is Creasy, my bodyguard.

Sister Anna shakes his hand.

                           SISTER ANNA
             Mr. Creasy.

                          PINTA
             No, Sister, he told me just to call him
             Creasy. He's American. From no state in
             particular.

                          SISTER ANNA
             You must look after our Pinta. We're so
             happy to have her back in school. Run
             along now, Pinta.

Pinta waves goodbye, bounds away.   They watch her go.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   24.


                          SISTER ANNA
             She's late, Mr. Creasy.

                          CREASY
             Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes.
             I -- It won't happen again.

                          SISTER ANNA
             No offense, but I'm sorry that your
             profession needs to exist.

                          CREASY
             So am I, Sister.

                          SISTER ANNA
             Do you ever see the hand of God in what
             you do?

                          CREASY
             Not for a long time, sister.

                          SISTER ANNA
             The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil,
             but overcome evil with good."

                          CREASY
             Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.

Sister Anna is impressed.   She nods her 'props' to
Creasy.

                          CREASY
             I'm the sheep that got lost.

INT.   MERCEDES - CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - DAY

Creasy pulls out, starts down the street. He's only gone
a hundred meters when SIRENS kick up. A police car
behind him. Creasy shakes his head.

                          CREASY
             Here we go again.

Creasy pulls over, digs around the front seat as TWO
SLOPPY COPS head over.

                          SLOPPY COP ONE
             Do you speak English, Senor?

                           CREASY
             Yeah.   And Spanish.

                          SLOPPY COP ONE
             You have an identification?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   25.


Creasy hands them his PASSPORT and a printed LETTER. A
legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed
by Rayburn.

Creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel,
then the other. Minimizing the confrontation.

                          CREASY
             It's a temporary license for the gun I'm
             carrying. I just went through all of
             this at the airport.

INT.   BIG BURLY SUV - DRIVING TOWARD THE BORDER - DAY

Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. Rayburn's
daily routine. He sits up front an Uzi cradled in his
lap. As his own cell phone rings, he answers.

                          RAYBURN
             Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?
                    (listens; laughs)
             Yeah?

                                                CUT TO:

POLICE LINE-UP WALL - As Creasy's MUG SHOT is flashed.

CREASY'S HAND - As he's fingerprinted.

                          CREASY
             There's still ink on my fingers from last
             week.

                                                CUT TO:

RAYBURN'S SUV

                          RAYBURN
             You got tossed. Don't trust the cops,
             especially the Judicials.
                    (listens; laughs again)
             Oh you know that?

INT. BAR - DAY

Creasy slams a Jack and Coke.

EXT.   HIGH STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another
species as he moves through them. Might as well wear a
shark fin. He spots something: a MUSIC STORE.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      26.


INT.   MUSIC STORE - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy finds the section he's looking for, searches a
rack. There. As he pulls a particular CD, we are not
privy to what it is.

EXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY

Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the
other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand
together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a
share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less.

The doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a
huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the
Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in
marble.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY

Pinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy.     She looks out the
window, realizes...

                          PINTA
             We're taking a different way home.

                             CREASY
             That's right.

Pinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles.

                             PINTA
             I understand.     Smart.

No answer from Creasy.     It's hard not to feel foolish
around this kid.

                          PINTA
             Did you like school, Creasy?

                             CREASY
             No.

                             PINTA
             Not at all?

                             CREASY
             No.

                             PINTA
             But why not?

Creasy's hoping she'll just shut up.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    27.


                              PINTA
              Hmmm?

                           CREASY
              It wasn't a school like yours and there
              was no Sister Anna.

                           PINTA
              So you were unhappy?

                           CREASY
              Being unhappy is a state of mind.   I
              never thought about it.

                              PINTA
              Oh...

Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in.
She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.

Then, as she reaches out...

                           PINTA
              What happened to...

And touches it.

                              PINTA
              ...your hand?

Creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an
instant.

                           CREASY
              No more questions.

When he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something.

                           CREASY
              I'm not paid to be your friend.   I'm paid
              to protect you.

They drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over.
Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering.

                           CREASY
                     (exasperated)
              And don't start crying.

                           PINTA
              I'm not crying.

But she is.   As Creasy stops at a red light...

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      28.


                            CREASY
               Look, this is the way I am.   I don't like
               questions. I --

And she's out the door.

                            CREASY
               Shit.

Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.

INTERSECTION

Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is
already getting back in the car. This time in the
backseat.

Creasy sighs. The light goes green.     Scooters whine away
and horns blare.

MERCEDES

Creasy sits back behind the wheel.

                            PINTA
               You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.

Creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead.
As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving.

INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Creasy sits at the table   with the old gardener GOMEZ
(we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier
exteriors). Gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going
after any remnants with a   crust of bread. Creasy hasn't
touched his.

MARIA, the cook, enters.    As she clocks Creasy's plate...

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET

'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very
accomplished player.

Creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a
glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door.

                            CREASY
               Come in.

The door opens.    It's Lisa.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  29.


                         LISA
            Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you
            have everything you need.

                           CREASY
            I'm fine.

                         LISA
            Is the food alright?    Maria tells me that
            you didn't eat.

                         CREASY
            The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.

                         LISA
                   (smiles)
            It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if
            you have to... Do you mind if I talk to
            you for a moment?

He shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a
dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.

                         LISA
            How are you getting along with Pinta?

                         CREASY
            We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a
            new toy.

                         LISA
                   (smiles)
            Yes, she told me.   Do you have children,
            Mr. Creasy?

                           CREASY
            No.

                         LISA
            You should know they're tenacious when
            they want something. And Pinta wants to
            be friends.

                         CREASY
            You're paying me to protect her, not
            amuse her. Right?

A beat and then Lisa nods.

                         CREASY
            Look. Maybe this isn't going to work.
            Maybe you should ask your husband to hire
            someone... more sociable.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    30.


                          LISA
             No, you're right. You were hired to
             protect her, that's enough. I'm
             confident you'll do that.

Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun
and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives
her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's
proximity.

                          LISA
             I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know
             that's silly to say.

Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.

                          LISA
             It makes it all seem so serious.

                          CREASY
             It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.

                          LISA
             Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with
             you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.

Finally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door.
Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.

INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her
prayer.

                          PINTA
             Give me God what you still have.    Give me
             what no one else asks for.

Then, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's "Blue Bayou" starts
to drift through the open window, down from the room
above.

                          RONSTADT
             "I'm going back someday, come what may,
             to Blue Bayou..."

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the
stereo. The empty bag from the record store. This is
the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back-
up button. "Blue Bayou" begins again. Creasy takes the
9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    31.


INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy
does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the
round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No
good.

He chambers another round.     Tries again.   Nope.

                          LINDA RONSTADT
             Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come
             true, on Blue Bayou...

INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy
whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her
every move, perplexed.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round.
Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the
barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.
Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it
in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple
on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
actions. Pinta still dances.

INT.   RAYBURN'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 3.A.M.

Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican
WIFE and their four-year-old SON.

As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings.
Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES
there, one of them ringing. Rayburn finds it.

                            RAYBURN
             Rayburn...    Creasy! What's wrong?

EXT.   RAMOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark
behind him. On his cell phone.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     32.


                         CREASY
            I said, have you ever had a nine
            millimeter round that just didn't go off?

                                        INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:

Rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.

                         RAYBURN
            You mean a misfire?

                         CREASY
            I mean nothing. The hammer came down and
            nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.

                         RAYBURN
            I've heard of it. Never happened to me
            though. Maybe the firing pin's off.

                            CREASY
            Maybe...

Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.

                         RAYBURN
            It's like we always used to say: a bullet
            always tells the truth. What were you
            shooting at?

Creasy doesn't answer.    He holds the bullet up, looks at
it.

                            RAYBURN
                      (focusing; concerned)
            Creasy?

                         CREASY
            Sorry I woke you, Ray.

Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the
house, but stops short again.

There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her
room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing
her for the first time. And she's been watching him
forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected
somehow.

INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox.
It takes it place of honor front and center on the
shrine. Next to the Marlboros and scotch. The New
Testament is set down nearby.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   33.


CU - Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY

Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back.
Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares
straight ahead. But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals
a look at him.

EXT.   STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY

As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA
COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY

Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of
paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with.

                          CREASY
             Pinta, do you have a pencil?

                          PINTA
             I go to school, don't I?

Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's
thinking.

                           CREASY
             Please?

Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a
pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch
up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate.

Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her
shoulder...

BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop.    The
Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.

                           CREASY
             Sorry.

                          LISA
             The traffic takes some getting used to.

As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes
by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This
relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       34.


EXT.   COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY

They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks;
Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek.

                               PINTA
               Bye, Mom.

                            LISA
               Don't forget your towel.

Pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel. As she
starts to walk past Creasy without a      word, he holds out
her pencil. She holds up, shows him       a SECOND PENCIL,
continues on her way. Doesn't need       him.

MERCEDES

Creasy gets back in, starts away.

                            LISA
               She has swimming practice today.    You'll
               need to pick her up at the pool.

Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with
Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window.

                            LISA
               I talked to her. She understands.     She
               won't bother you anymore.

As Creasy just drives.

EXT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He
checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass
quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and
Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN.

                               LISA
                         (sees him)
               Creasy!
                      (stepping over)
               Meet Jordan and Evelyn.

Creasy nods.    They study him with interest.

                            JORDAN
               So you're the bodyguard?
                      (Creasy nods again)
               You used to be, what did they used to
               call it, a soldier of fortune?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                 35.


Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a
final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.

                          EVELYN
                   (giggles)
            Does he talk?

As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers...

                           EVELYN
            He's sexy...

Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks.

                         JORDAN
            You see any danger out there?
                   (laughs)
            The fear's worse than the reality.

Just a blankness from Creasy.

                         JORDAN
            I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would
            you take a bullet for your employer, for
            Samuel?

A condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer.

                         CREASY
            I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.

                         JORDAN
            For Pinta then?

                           LISA
            Jordan!

                         CREASY
            If something happened, my reaction would
            be to fight to protect her. I have
            skills in that respect. Pinta would
            benefit by the fact that... I'm a
            soldier.

                         JORDAN
            What kind of an answer is that?

                         CREASY
            The answer is the truth.   The question is
            foolish.

Lisa smiles at the answer, kisses Jordan on the cheek.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     36.


                          LISA
             Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.
             I promise not to let Evelyn spend too
             much.

Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets
his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass.

As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to
open the door.

MERCEDES

Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he
goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains
standing on the curb watching the car pull away.
Something odd about it all.

EXT.   PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum. Creasy
arrives at the public pool.    A practice. Several
bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool. Give Creasy a
less than friendly look. As    he looks for Pinta...

A GUN goes off.

Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS
splash into the water.

He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's
in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her.
Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still
second.

She surfaces, frustrated.    As she sees Creasy there...

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook.
Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally.

                            CREASY
             You're fast.

                          PINTA
             Once I get in the water but not starting
             off. By the time I catch up, it's too
             late.

She keeps writing.   The number "2" over and over.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch.     All alone
needless to say.

Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that
Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in
Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and
surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the
editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking
about organized crime in Mexico.

From out the window, a CAW, then again.     Yet again.

Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out,
sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him.

Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW.

Creasy decides to play.    He CAWS in return.

Pinta looks around.    Creasy does a pretty good
impersonation.

Hears Pinta CAW again.

                          CREASY
             Hey... Pinta...

She looks up at him.

                          CREASY
             What are you doing?

                          PINTA
             Calling for Emilio's macaw.    I thought I
             heard him.

                          CREASY
             Do you think he'll come back?

                            PINTA
             Maybe.    Did you hear him?

                            CREASY
             No.

                          PINTA
             How do you think he got out?

                          CREASY
                    (a beat)
             Well, I let him go.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     38.


                          PINTA
             It's better to be free, right?

                           CREASY
             Yes.   Actually, he was driving me crazy.

Creasy disappears back inside. Pinta smiles big before
letting the stick drop to the ground.

                          PINTA
             I got you to talk, Creasy bear.

Blue Bayou plays.   Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound.

                          RONSTADT
             "...I'm so lonesome all the time, since I
             left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou."

EXT.   RAMOS VILLA - DAY

A DRIVER gets Samuel's and Lisa's luggage into a car.
They're on their way, kissing Pinta goodbye.

                          LISA
             I'll call you from Detroit, baby.

                          PINTA
             You're going to miss Mexican Halloween.
             The Day of the Dead.

                          SAMUEL
             You enjoy it for us, Pinta.

Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has
to be. Finally, Pinta nods.

Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the
Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last
time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door.

INT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY

Creasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back
seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms.

                          CREASY
             They'll be back in a week.

                          PINTA
             They can stay for two weeks.   I don't
             care.

She's got a toughness Creasy likes.   As she looks out the
window, he looks ahead.

INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Creasy eats.

                            CREASY
               The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a
               real talent.

Maria beams with pleasure.

                            MARIA
               My pleasure, Creasy.

Pinta enters  in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a
bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table
from Creasy.   As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts
to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and
no place to  go.

Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room.        As
Maria and Creasy exchange a look...

EXT./INT.   WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there
it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof.

EXT.   ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY

Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the
roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she
crosses, disappears over the peak.

It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at
Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The
bird moves away, just out of her reach each time.

CHIMNEY

Pinta coming down the other slope.      There's the macaw.

                             PINTA
               Come on.   Come on.   Bird!

The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away.
She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile
covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard
barking loudly.

Near the edge, she manages to stop.      Whew!

She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She
slides again. This time right off the edge.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      40.


She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the
ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks:

INT.   KITCHEN - DAY

                           PINTA'S VOICE
             CREASY!

Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.

EXT.   SIDE YARD - DAY

Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one
side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the
gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet...

...landing in a hedge.   Creasy dashes over.

                           CREASY
             Pinta!

She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head.
Frank's licking her face.

                           PINTA
             It hurts.

                           CREASY
             Where?

                          PINTA
                    (Short)
             Everywhere!

She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs.     Creasy
carefully probes with his fingers. She winces.

                          CREASY
             I don't think they're broken.     Anywhere
             else?

                           PINTA
             My ankle.

As Maria huffs and puffs her way up.

                          CREASY
             I'm going to get you out, okay?

Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her,
lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in
his arms.

                             PINTA
             Oh, Creasy...

And she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty
foot fall. Begins to cross herself.

                            CREASY
             It's okay.    She's just scared.

Creasy cradles her, pats her back.      As Pinta says his
name like a mantra...

INT.   HOTEL ROOM - DETROIT - NIGHT

Lisa on the phone. Fantastic in a black evening dress.
The Ford car industry dinner awaits her entrance.

                          LISA
             You're sure she's alright?

Samuel enters from the bathroom, concern on his face.

                            LISA
             Okay, good,   you're sure.
                    (to   Samuel)
             He took her   for an X-ray, but it's just a
             bruise and   a sprain.

She turns her back so Samuel can zip her dress up.

                          LISA
             Thank you, Creasy.      Give her my love.

INT.   STAIRCASE - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT

Creasy makes his way up, enters...

PINTA'S BEDROOM

Pinta in bed propped up by a pillow, teddy bear beside
her. Frank at the head of the bed.

                          PINTA
             The night you arrived, Mom asked you if
             you had a family and you lied, didn't
             you?

                          CREASY
             White lie. I didn't have a family. But
             I did have two kids. They're adults now.

It's a sensitive subject so Pinta moves on.      She nods.
Creasy looks at the bear. An odd beat.

                          CREASY
             Do you always sleep with him?

                          PINTA
             I'm too old for him.     Don't tell my
             friends.

                          CREASY
             I don't talk to them much.     Does he have
             a name?

Pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'.
Liar.

                          CREASY
             I spoke to your mother.     She sends her
             love.

Pinta nods. Creasy stands there a beat, then heads for
the door. Almost out, he looks back.

                           CREASY
             Some bodyguard I turned out to be.       Good
             night, Pinta.

He's halfway out the door.

                           PINTA
             Creasy?   Could you play the song?

Creasy is confused a moment, but when he sees her open
window, he realizes.

                           CREASY
             Blue Bayou.   You got it.

He goes.   As Pinta eases back with a sigh and a smile...

EXT.   MERCEDES - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY

Pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to
the Mercedes.

Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over. Creasy opens the
back door for her. But when she gets there, she
hesitates.

                          PINTA
             I think I'll sit in the front.     There's
             more room for my foot.

Creasy makes no big deal of it. He takes her crutches,
opens the front. As she scoots inside... Frank waits
and watches. Creasy calls to him.

                          PINTA
             He's only allowed to travel in the car on
             weekends. Dad says the car will smell
             'doggie'.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY

Both of them up front. Pinta is happy to be there and
Creasy doesn't seem to mind.

                          CREASY
             Did you sleep alright?

                            PINTA
             Yes.

                          CREASY
             How's the ankle? Can you put your weight
             on it?

                            PINTA
             It's   not too bad. Will it take a long
             time   before it's better? Our big swim
             meet   is in three weeks. Interschools.
             I was   going to swim in the one hundred
             meter   freestyle.

                          CREASY
             In a week you should be fine.

They drive on a few silent beats, until...

                          PINTA
             Doesn't matter. I always finish second.

                          CREASY
             You need to practice.

Pinta looks at him hopefully, but Creasy catches himself.
He's not going to coach a little girl. Finally...

                            PINTA
             I will.

INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - EVENING

Gomez, Maria and Creasy again joined by Pinta.    As Creasy
places a fork of meat into his mouth...

                          PINTA
             Creasy, what's a concubine?

Creasy opens his mouth, takes the fork of meat back out.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   44.


                         CREASY
            Why do you ask?

                         PINTA
            It was in a book at school.   Concubine.

Maria and Gomez wait to see how he'll answer.

                         CREASY
            Well, it's a sort of wife.

                         PINTA
            But the Emperor of China had 1000 of
            them! How can that be?

                         CREASY
            In the West, it's one wife for one
            husband, but different cultures have
            different rules.

                         PINTA
            It must be difficult having lots of
            wives.

                         CREASY
            You feel sorry for the husband?

                         PINTA
                   (in Spanish)
            Yeah. Can you imagine my mother
            multiplied by a thousand?

Maria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy
smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory.

                         PINTA
            Creasy, you're smiling.

He reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing.
And Creasy can't help but smile again.

                            CREASY
            I guess I am.

Pinta changes subject.

                         PINTA
            So how come you know so much about those
            countries?

                         CREASY
            I had to do my homework on them when I
            worked there. Also I enjoy history.

                          PINTA
             What did you do in Asia? Is that where
             you met the man with cigarettes?

                          CREASY
             No, that was in Columbia.

A MAN'S HAND.   BLACK.

Raises up against the blue sky. Like a kid playing
Cowboys and Indians. The finger pulls an imaginary
trigger.

RAMOS POOL

In her swimsuit and cap, Pinta crouches in makeshift
starting blocks.

                            CREASY
             Bang!

Pinta takes off. Splashes into the water.     Not to
Creasy's satisfaction.

                          CREASY
             No, no, come back.

Pinta turns in the water, looks back at him.

                          CREASY
             You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you
             react. You go. Don't listen for the
             sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate
             on the sound itself.

                          PINTA
             I don't understand.

                            CREASY
             Don't worry.    You will.

Creasy points at the blocks.    Pinta gets out of the
water.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  46.


Shivering, Creasy throws a towel around her and
rubs her down.

INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING

On the way to school. Pinta is stealing looks at
Creasy's right hand. She knows the answer must be
serious, but she has to ask.

                          PINTA
             Creasy, what happened to your hand?

Creasy looks at her a moment, deciding. Pinta
practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the
answer may come. Creasy checks the mirror, watches the
road.

                          CREASY
             A man asked me questions once.   He smoked
             a lot. There was no ashtray.

That's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues
watching the road. Pinta watches him.

                          CREASY
             Remember you asked me what state I was
             from?

                            PINTA
             Yes.

                          CREASY
             Where you're from isn't so much about
             geography; it's about events. Where
             you're from is what happened to you.

                          PINTA
             Good things happen, too, Creasy.
                    (smiles big)
             Like meeting me.

                          CREASY
                    (after a beat)
             I guess that really does make me a hard
             case.

As the two of them share a LAUGH...

INT.   3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT

Lisa walking toward Creasy's room. As she moves to
knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. She
peeks in.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     47.


Creasy and Pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a
book spread out before them. Doing her history homework.

LISA'S POV - OF CREASY

He's charming and great with Pinta.     And sexy... Evelyn
was right.

                          PINTA
             Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?

                           CREASY
             No.

                          PINTA
             Did you used to?

                           CREASY
             Yeah.   Two or three.

Lisa continues to watch the little play. She smiles,
knocks on the door as she opens it. Pinta and Creasy
both look back over their shoulders.

                          LISA
             Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off
             Pinta, could you come back to take me to
             get my hair done?

Creasy nods. They both continue to look at her.      She
gets the feeling she's interrupting.

                          LISA
             Alright, I'll leave you two to your
             history.

As she goes...

EXT.   HAIRDRESSERS - ZONA ROSA - DAY

Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy
stands by the car across the street. Cooling his heels.
He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop.

Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself.
The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go
up.

A police car comes prowling down the empty street.
Creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.

Then, Creasy spots a BUSINESSMAN coming out of a doorway
with a BODYGUARD attached. The bodyguard is speaking
into a two-way radio.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    48.


Creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a Mercedes 500 pulls up to
collect the businessman.

And the cop car disappears around the corner even as TWO
MEN start toward the businessman.

Lisa exits the hairdresser's.    Looks stunning.

Creasy starts across the street toward her.

A second car squeals around the corner behind the
Mercedes and everything goes to Hell.

GUNFIRE erupts.

And then Creasy is there.

His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet.
The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a
shop doorway, Creasy on top of her. Shielding her.

The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body
guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's
shot.

A PEDESTRIAN is killed.

Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.

The businessman is hustled into the back of the second
car.

Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.

She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of
tires. A parked VAN also hauling ass out of there. But
then she's aware of something else.

Creasy on top of her.   She feels his weight, his heat...

                            CREASY
             Don't move.

She watches as he rises, goes to the curb. One bodyguard
is sprawled dead across the ground. Red blood on the
sidewalk. As Lisa closes her eyes.

INT.   MERCEDES - STREET - DAY

Lisa sits in the backseat. Through the window we can see
Creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the JUDICIAL
POLICE. Finally he gets in the car, starts to drive.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      49.


                          LISA
             Murdering people in the street... You
             had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?

The shoulders in front of her just shrug.

                          CREASY
             Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides,
             there was another one in the passenger
             side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun.
             If I'd started shooting his friends, he
             would've had me. And you.

Quiet a beat. Lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her
hair, looks from it to Creasy.

                          CREASY
             A minimum close protection team consists
             of four men for high threat targets and
             environments. Even in a low threat
             situation, you need two guards plus a
             security trained driver.

She shakes involuntarily. It's hitting her.      As they
make eye contact through the mirror...

EXT.   HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - MEXICO CITY - DAY

The Mercedes parked. Creasy and Lisa up against it.
Fucking. No cultured way to put it. Like animals. A
primal release for both of them.

EXT.   COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY

Pinta waiting alone. Creasy's late. Then the gate
swings back; the Mercedes drives through. Smiling, she
hurries over, hops in the passenger seat.

MERCEDES - ROLLING

                          PINTA
                    (happy to see him)
             You're late.

                           CREASY
             I'm sorry.

                          PINTA
             You were never late before, I was
             worried.

Creasy doesn't answer.    He actually looks guilty.   Pinta
watches him a moment.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    50.


                          PINTA
             Where's my mother?

                          CREASY
             I dropped her at home.

                          PINTA
             It's no wonder you're late.      Why didn't
             she just come with you?

Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. Pinta keeps looking
at him and it suddenly all makes sense.

He looks over at her, starts to say something, then
thinks better of it. Finally...

                          PINTA
             Do you think my mother likes you?

She's for sure pissed. Definitely aware and definitely
jealous. Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.

                          CREASY
             I think she's afraid of me.      But not the
             same way most people are.

Pinta considers this.   Then..

                          PINTA
             I'm not afraid you, Creasy.

                          CREASY
             I know you're not.

                          PINTA
             Are you afraid of me?

Creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.

                             CREASY
             I used to be.     At first.   But not
             anymore.

Her smile is huge.

                             PINTA
             Good.

Heated. Steam rising off the water. PINTA stands with
her eyes closed. Creasy, standing beside her, brings TWO
BLOCKS together with a WHACK!

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       51.


Pinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs
an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head.
Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around
her. Frank oversees the whole program.

                          CREASY
             The gunshot holds no fear.    Say it.

                          PINTA
             The gunshot holds no fear.

                          CREASY
             You welcome the sound. The sound is what
             lets you go. The sound is what frees
             you. You are a prisoner in those blocks
             until you hear the sound.

Eyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And
Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face.

Pinta smiles at the sound.     Creasy smiles at the sight.

EXT.   RAMOS POOL - DAY

WHACK!   Pinta bolts from the blocks.    SPLASHES.

WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Pinta surges.      Pinta arcs.    Pinta
knifes into the water.

Pinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line.
Creasy checks his watch, claps.

                          PINTA
             I'm tough, Creasy.    I'm tough as you.

                          CREASY
             There's no such thing as tough.    You're
             either trained or untrained.

Pinta raises her arms overhead, makes like Rocky across
the shallow end. Creasy shakes his head in amusement.

INT.   LISA'S BEDROOM - DAWN

First light is just tracing outlines against the window.
Lisa alone in bed, staring at the ceiling. Frightened at

As the Mercedes pulls in, another car is ahead of it.
Samuel is home, a DRIVER pulls his LUGGAGE from the
trunk.

Pinta gets out of the Mercedes.

                           PINTA
             Hi, Dad.

He gives her a pat on the head. Simultaneously, Samuel
fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. He
thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's.

                          SAMUEL
             I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what
             you did for my wife.

Creasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past
Samuel to Pinta who looks bemused. He doesn't even want
to know exactly what she knows.

The Car Wash Guy, - Pedro, ingratiates himself with
Samuel.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Creasy's finger presses play. "Blue Bayou" begins.
Plaintive, haunting. As he moves to sit in his chair, he
passes the scotch bottle. It has gone unopened.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, smoothly
catches it on the back of his hand. Rock steady.
Frank's tail wags.

EXT.   PARKING LOT - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY

The big swim meet. Race day. A lot of security, men
speaking into their wrists. For a public gathering the
mood almost seems ominous. Creasy and Pinta exit the
Mercedes. Pinta watches wistfully as her fellow STUDENTS
stream toward the water with their PARENTS.

             What's so important in Los Angeles?

                          CREASY
             Your father has business.

                            PINTA
             Why today?    And why'd she have to go with
             him?

Creasy shrugs. No comforting answer for her.     He looks
around at some of the other bodyguards.

                          CREASY
             Good luck. I'll be waiting here when
             you're done.

But she's shaking her head adamantly.    Determined.

                          PINTA
             You're coming with me.

EXT.   SWIMMING MEET - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY

A big MARQUEE has been set up alongside the pool.
Coltish girls in swimsuits. Parents socialize, drink
cocktails. Richly dressed. Bodyguards and security are
outside of it, on the perimeter.

Creasy looks completely out of place.

                          PINTA
             Stand near the finish line.

Pinta starts away.

                            CREASY
             Pinta.

She turns, looks back at him.

                            CREASY
            The blocks.

                         PINTA
                   (smiles; knows)
            I'm a prisoner in them.    Until the
            gunshot sets me free.

Creasy nods. He smiles. He's serious now. As he
watches her head off for the track, Sister Anna steps up.

                         SISTER ANNA
            Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.

And now Creasy is completely out of place.

                         CREASY
                   (apologetic)
            Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles.      I
            was going to wait in the courtyard,
            but...

She takes his arm, pats his hand.

                         SISTER ANNA
            Today you are her father.

As Creasy lets this sink   in, looks out where Pinta is
warming up. Sister  Anna   smiles, heads off to a group of
parents. We're left  with   Creasy. Confused Creasy. But
clarity is creeping in.    As the sky opens up around
him...

                                                   CUT TO:

STARTER'S PISTOL

Pointed up at precisely 45 degrees.    BAAAANGG!

STARTING BLOCKS

Eyes closed serenely, Pinta surges forward, leaving
everyone behind.

CREASY

Sees it. She hasn't even hit the water and he already
knows she's won.

PINTA

SPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface.
Her head sweeping left and then right.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   55.


Wherever her competitors are, it's somewhere behind her.
And the future, everything ahead, is wide open.

TURN WALL - UNDERWATER

Pinta somersaults, kicks off and is gone.

SURFACE

And the finish line seems to come to her.

THE CROWD

Cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall.

CREASY

Watches her, satisfied with what he's done.

Pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs.

A beeline for Creasy. And the poor fucker doesn't even
understand, until she's leaping the last few feet...

Into his arms.

                          PINTA
             I won, Creasy! I won!

She loves him...   Creasy hugs her.   He loves her back.

INT.   TRADITIONAL RESTAURANT - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

A MARIACHI BAND roams. We see Creasy but not who he's
with. A date? As we come around it's Pinta. Sitting
with them, Rayburn and his wife. And a sleeping four-
year-old.

NOTE: Rethink following dialogue with reference to
Creasy / Rayburn background.

                          PINTA
             My Dad said all your friends were dead.

                          RAYBURN
             All but one. The most important one.
             When we were eighteen, we made an
             agreement to "take the world" together.

                          CREASY
             Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in
             love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said
             what happened to the plan?

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    56.


                         RAYBURN
            I said the plan was right here.

Rayburn looks at beautiful 19-year-old Alicia and their
four-year-old son sleeping.

                         CREASY
            I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I
            got it.

Alicia blows Creasy a kiss.

                         CREASY
            Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone
            to bed?

Laughter.

                         PINTA
            Okay, I think now is as good as time as
            any.

She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds
it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her
hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate
drawstring.

Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple,
but fine MEDALLION and chain into the palm of his hand.

                         PINTA
            I bought it with my own money.     I saved
            it.

Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it.    She takes
it, slips it over his head.

                         PINTA
            It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost
            causes.

                         RAYBURN
            And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St.
            Jude became a Saint in the first place.

                         PINTA
            Yeah, that's right.

Creasy looks at it, considers.

                         CREASY
            Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  57.


Pinta kisses him. As the Mariachi band drifts over,
Rayburn grabs his wife by the hand.

                          RAYBURN
             Come on, baby. I feel like a third
             wheel. Watch the kid.

They dance. A waiter steps over, refills Creasy's water
glass. As he drinks...

                          PINTA
             Could I ask you a question?

                          CREASY
             Could I stop you?

                          PINTA
             You don't drink like you used to.

                          CREASY
             That's not a question.

                          PINTA
             I know because I go in your room and
             check the bottles.

                          CREASY
             Still not a question.

                          PINTA
             My mom drinks, too...    Why do people
             drink, Creasy?

                          CREASY
             Now that's a question. I don't know
             about your Mom. For me, the problem
             isn't in the glass. The problem's in
             between my ears.

                          PINTA
             You think too much?

                           CREASY
             Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't
             think enough.

Pinta nods, thinks she understands.

INT.   AIRPORT - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Samuel and Lisa on the moving escalator. Home from Los
Angeles. They look down through the glass, see Creasy
waiting for them below. And finally, Lisa frowns.

            He has to go, Samuel.

            What?   Who?

                            LISA
            Creasy.

                           SAMUEL
            Why?    You were so pleased with him.

                         LISA
            Pinta likes him too much.
                   (a beat)
            She thinks of him as a father.

                         SAMUEL
            That's ridiculous.

                            LISA
            It's not.

Samuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic.

                         SAMUEL
            I've just been so busy, Lisa.

                            LISA
            He has to go.

Samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy.

                         SAMUEL
            The three month trial ends in a week. I
            just won't confirm the position. That
            possibility was understood when I hired
            him.

Lisa gives him a look. She wants it done today.     But for
once, Samuel is stronger than his wife.

                         SAMUEL
            I won't create bad feelings. And another
            week won't make a difference.

Off the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting
unaware.

                         SAMUEL
            It will be a hard break.

             I wasn't thinking of Pinta.

smiling big.

             will play.

As Pinta marches out of the room...

EXT. RAMOS VILLA- DAY

The sounds of Samuel's baby grand resonates throughout
the villa. An impassioned rendering of a Mozart
symphony.

Pinta is looking for Frank. Today is Saturday and on
weekends Frank is allowed to travel with them. And today
she is claiming all her rights.

             Frank.   Frankie.

Pinta whistles.

             You should break all my fingers, Creasy,
             then tape them back together. I won't be
             able to play the piano, but I could still
             swim.

                          CREASY
             Don't be a baby. You're tougher than
             that.

                          PINTA
             There's no such thing as tough, Creasy.

             Be a swimmer.

                          PINTA
             I could do it. Remember the day   you
             wanted the pencil? I know why.    And I
             saw that car again. I wrote the   license
             number in my notebook. Except I   missed
             the last number.

Creasy checks his mirror, nothing back there now.     He
then looks at Pinta. A bit amazed.

                          CREASY
             You'll have to show me that number when
             we get home.

EXT.   VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY

A wide avenue. The Mercedes pulls up parks in the only
open spot. Creasy and Pinta get out. We walks her
across the street, along the lawn to the apartment
building. They look up at the sound of piano keys
tinkling above. Then:

Creasy looks at her, smiles to himself.   Pinta looks
back.

                          CREASY

            You'll be back in the water in twenty-
            four hours.

Creasy presses the buzzer. As they wait, Pinta sees
something, reaches down to pull a DANDELION from a crack
where the sidewalk meets the wall. She smiles at Creasy.

                         PINTA
            For you, Creasy.

Creasy takes it from her. He's saved by the bell as a
second buzzer answers the first. Creasy pulls the door
open. Pinta heaves a resigned sigh.

                         CREASY
            Remember 'dyslexic.'

As Pinta nods, disappears inside...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:

2ND FLOOR WINDOW

The curtains rustle in the breeze. The sound of badly
played scales. And then sounds of frustration.

Then, the sound of the teacher playing.   Pinta appears in
the window for just a moment.

CREASY

Looking up from the window of the Mercedes. As Pinta is
called back inside, Creasy checks out, twirls the
dandelion Pinta gave him. HUMS to himself. "Blue
Bayou."

                                               CUT TO:

THE STREET

Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding
by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his
shirt.

And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the
previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy
straightens up.

A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes
eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys
who were at Zona Rosa.

Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment
building. At the same time as...

The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a
huge grin on her face. She was not accepted.

And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way.

The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from
Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.

THE COROLLA

Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to
Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat...

                           CREASY
                     (drawing his 9mm)
              Run, Pinta, run!

But she's rooted with fear.

And the men are almost on her.

Creasy raises the 9mm overhead.    BANG!

And the sound frees her.   Pinta runs!

Ducking under a flailing arm.    Quick and lithe.   Trying
to reach her bodyguard.

The cops drawing Uzi's..

Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.     He fires
twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest.

Pinta runs.   Chased by the TWO MEN.

COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten
bullet line.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        63.


Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high
in the chest and throat. Precise.

Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men
chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs.

A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the
Corolla.

Creasy fires back.    BOOM!    BOOM!

MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above
his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit
in the shoulder.

And Pinta disappears into the traffic.        Gone.

MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.

Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He
falls to his knees.

The dandelion starts to come apart.      Drifting away, piece
by piece.

Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER
heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans
for Pinta who's nowhere in sight.

She got away!   Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on
his side.

                              PINTA'S VOICE
            CREASY!

And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't
leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.

                              CREASY
            NOOO...

She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.

                              PINTA
            Creasy...

MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the
sedan. Creasy can only blink after them.

                            CREASY
              Pinta...

MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat
driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams
shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away.

We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield.
An anguished image before she's pulled back down.

Creasy makes a wish.     Not for himself, but for her.

                           CREASY
              Don't die, Creasy, don't die.

And everything goes very, very,

INT.    HOSPITAL ROOM - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Creasy hooked up. Tubes running in and out of the
unconscious man. And he's suddenly surrounded.

The CHIEF of the Judicial Police and several uniformed
OFFICERS. At the foot of the bed several NEWSPAPER
REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS.

                           CHIEF
              This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an
              American citizen, is under arrest for the
              murder of two police officers, Hector
              Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also
              the prime suspect in the kidnapping of
              Pinta Martin Ramos.

One of the officers props up Creasy's head.     The chief
puffs his chest out and flashes flash.

INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - DAY

A bedraggled-looking Samuel sits with Jordan by the

Maria cries softly in a doorway.

MONTAGE - of chaos and panic. Judicial police are trying

Video cameras.

             amount they expect...

They react as two vehicles pull up outside. Chaos as the
front door opens. MEN IN SUITS, several POLICEMEN.
Their very well-groomed leader is COLONEL TAZINARI.

                          TAZINARI
             Senor Ramos. I am Ernesto Tazinari,
             commandante of the Judicial anti-
             kidnapping division.

                          JORDAN
             We do not need or want police
             involvement. I am the negotiator. We
             feel a better guarantee of getting Pinta
             back without your involvement.

                           TAZINARI
             I have a written order from the Public
             Ministry. Two police officers were
             killed.
                     (he holds up the phone)
             This is the Attorney General Navarro

              The law requires an intervention by the
              authorities "de officio."

A ringing phone sounds like an bomb exploding in the
room. A technician answers. Jordan takes the receiver.
We hear the conversation. The kidnapper only wants to
talk to the father. Everybody is one headsets,
monitoring. Samuel listens carefully. Jordan prompts
him with hand-written replies on a notepad. Samuel
negotiates the amount via notes from his lawyer.

QUICK CUTS:

                           SAMUEL
              It's impossible. I cannot afford thirty
              million. I will need to borrow the
              money.

Samuel proposes five million.   Kidnapper gets angry.
Demands 20 million.

They settle at ten million.   The kidnapper gives a list
of instructions.

Another showcase press conference.     More REPORTERS and

                           CHIEF
              The girl is a Mexican citizen. Her
              father is Samuel Valencia Ramos.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - WINDOW OVERLOOKING PRESS
CONFERENCE

Rosanna, the woman we saw on T.V. earlier, stands
watching and listening. Incredulous and angry.

MIGUEL MANZANO the Director of AFI (also seen earlier
on TV), approaches with his two assistants and kisses
Rosanna on the cheek.

                           ROSANNA
              A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a
              9 year old. The bodyguard's American.
              Not only that he's black.

                           MANZANO
              Is that good or bad?

                           ROSANNA
              That's good. Really good. He shot and
              killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper
              died in the attack. They're saying he's
              responsible.

Manzano looks bemused, as he eats a sugary pastry.
Rosanna heads into the press conference.

INT.   ENTRY LOBBY - HOSPITAL - DAY

                           REPORTER ONE
              Beside the American in custody, are any
              other Americans involved in the
              kidnapping?

                           CHIEF
              We're looking into it.

Rosanna can't believe what she's hearing.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   68.


                          ROSANNA
             The two officers who were killed.
             Records show they were off duty at the
             time.

The Chief frowns at the sight of Rosanna, knows what a
royal pain in the ass she is. Manzano awaits his answer.

                             CHIEF
             I'm not sure.     All I know is they died
             bravely.

He turns, points out another reporter.

                          ROSANNA
             If they were off duty, why were they in a
             patrol car? What exactly were they doing
             at the scene of a kidnapping?

He stares back over at her, furious.     Rosanna smiles.

                          ROSANNA
             Were they known for their exceptional
             good luck?

It opens and out slides Rayburn. He looks down the
hallway. Press conference is still going down that way.
Rayburn heads the other way.

But as he tries to enter Creasy's room, he's met in the
door by TWO THUG COPS, in uniform.

                             COP ONE
             No visitors.

Cop two pokes a finger into Rayburn's chest.

             Who are you?

                          RAYBURN
             I'm here to see my friend.

Cop two pokes him again.     Goading him.

Rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his
wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano
is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO
PLAINCLOTHES.

Ignoring the proffered salutes, Manzano finishes his
pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards Rayburn.

                          MANZANO
             When I heard it was this hospital I was
             so pleased. There's a pastry shop
             nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it?

Rayburn shakes his head.

                          MANZANO
             The best pastries in Mexico.

Manzano holds out his right hand.

Creasy out of it still.    Rayburn and Manzano at the foot
of the bed.

                          RAYBURN
             He's not a cop killer.

                          MANZANO
             I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly
             adept at killing.

                          RAYBURN
             He was doing his job, protecting the
             girl. If police were involved, you
             figure it out. I'm here for him.

                           MANZANO
             So am I.

And Creasy stirs.   Rayburn leans into his friend, Manzano
just behind him.

                          RAYBURN
             You hear me, Crease?

Creasy's eyes slit open.

                          RAYBURN (CONT'D)

Cages of mangy looking mutts. Pull back to reveal Creasy

Rayburn sits nearby. He looks up as Creasy stirs, wakes
again. Creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the
first question on his mind. Pinta...

Rayburn looks away, can't face his friend.   And suddenly,
Creasy knows.

                           CREASY
             She's dead.   Isn't she?

Rayburn finally nods. And with that gesture, God takes
everything away. It might as well be the Old Testament.
And we are about to get Biblical.

Creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling.

                          RAYBURN
             It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the

                          NURSE
             A strange man. He has much experience of
             hospitals.

                          MANZANO
             Did he say so?

                           NURSE
             No.   But a nurse knows.

MUGSHOT

Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside
the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders.
Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy
shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   75.


                           MANZANO
            Nothing?

Creasy shakes his head.

                         MANZANO
            Excellent work by the way. Three men
            dead. Only ten rounds fired.

Creasy shakes his head at the next shot.

                         MANZANO
            If two of the men in my division could
            shoot like that, I could get rid of the
            other thirty-six.

One of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of
them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet.
Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages.

                         CREASY
            What am I doing here?

                         MANZANO
            Believe it or not, you're safe here. The
            Judicial police will kill you. If they
            can.
                   (re: book)
            This page?

                           CREASY
            No.

The adjutant reaches the last page.   Creasy shakes his
head.

                         MANZANO
            You have a rather checkered past. Mr.
            Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages
            long.

                         CREASY
            Am I a suspect?

                          MANZANO
            No.   It would be convenient, but no.

As Manzano packs up his mugshot books...

                         CREASY
            Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.
            Maybe then we'll get somewhere.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     76.


                          MANZANO
             All these photos you just saw were of
             policemen. Sadly they're protected. La
             Hermanidad. The brotherhood.

Manzano heads off.   As Creasy watches after him...

INT.   DOG PENS - NIGHT

Creasy sitting on the gurney, Rayburn buttons his shirt.

                           RAYBURN
                     (whispers)
             Okay?

Creasy nods. Rayburn gets Creasy's arm over his
shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the
floor.

Creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out.

EXT.   BACK SIDE - VETERINARIAN CLINIC - NIGHT

An SUV rolling away. Lights out, engine off. It coasts
a hundred yards before the engine turns over. Rayburn
behind the wheel. As it sweeps past camera...

INT.   SUV - ROLLING - NIGHT

Rayburn constantly checking the rear view.   No pursuit in
sight. He looks over at Creasy.

                          RAYBURN
             How do you feel?

Creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs.

                          CREASY
             Stomach's gone. But... okay.

                          RAYBURN
             I'll get you up to the border. Friend of
             mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop
             you right at the hospital.

Creasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the
passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy
sits up. A bit of an effort.

                          CREASY
             Got a thing I gotta do first.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       77.


EXT.   VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Scene of the crime. Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines'
where the policemen fell. A pyre of flowers where Pinta
was scooped up, Creasy's blood still staining the
sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up...

Rosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and
PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter
starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the
shrine.

Rosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her
eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle
beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else.

Across the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his
stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher,
surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of
Rosanna

CREASY (FLASHBACK)

Corolla.   Muzzle flashes.    Pinta screaming...

                             FEMALE VOICE
             Creasy...

Creasy wheels.   There's Rosanna.

                          ROSANNA
             A lot of people are looking for you.

                          CREASY
             I guess that makes you the smart one.

                          ROSANNA
             We're interested in the same thing.         I'm
             writing a story.

Creasy walks away from her.     Rosanna catches up and holds
out a plastic ziploc.

                          ROSANNA
             This might interest you.       I found it
             across the street.

Creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand.
A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle.
Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo.

FLASH:   Creasy at the police station.      His photo taken.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     78.


                             ROSANNA
               It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The
               religion of La Hermanidad. There's a
               curse on you.

                            CREASY
               It's a little late.

He hands it back to her, not interested.    As he turns to
go.

                            ROSANNA
               What are you going to do?

Creasy doesn't answer.

                            ROSANNA
               I can help. I have a situation Mr.
               Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le
               Hermanidad which protects both high
               ranking Government officials, corrupt
               police, and organized crime at a level
               that is very difficult for me to touch.
               I believe you were a victim of this
               organization. You and this story may
               help to unmask them.

Creasy looks carefully at Rosanna.    Right now he trusts
no one.

                            CREASY
               Thank you.

He walks away towards Rayburn.

EXT.   RAMOS HOUSE - DAWN

The SUV parked a discreet distance away. Rayburn grinds
out another cigarette, mutters to himself.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN

Bruno lets him in. Nothings been touched.     Creasy
retrieves his bullet from his shrine along   with the
'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts    his few
possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he    silently
crosses out into the hall, heads toward...

PINTA'S ROOM

He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own.
And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school
notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he
finds...

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        79.


The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he
notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page
references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I
love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy
turns.

Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes
drilling through Creasy.

                            LISA
                      (softly)
               You let them take her.     She loved you and
               you let them take her.

Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.

                            LISA
               Why are you here?     Why didn't you die?

                            CREASY
               Because...
                      (shrugs)
               I was already dead.

Eyes brimming, Lisa has no more words.       But Creasy comes
bearing cold comfort.

                              CREASY
               I want you   to know something.
                      (a   beat)
               I'm going   to kill them. Anyone who opens
               their eyes   at me.

Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is
suddenly monumental. Finally, Creasy looks away. He
picks up Pinta's battered, old TEDDY BEAR.

                              LISA
               Creasy...

He turns, but she doesn't look back at him.

                            LISA
               Kill them, Creasy.

Creasy nods.    He will.    As he continues away...

                            LISA (CONT'D)
               Kill them all.

EXT. GARDEN / POOL - RAMOS HOUSE

Creasy exits the house and stands by the pool. Frank
appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort Creasy.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       80.


Leaves blow across the surface of the water. Underwater
slow motion, a wall turn. It looks remarkably like
Pinta.

"Blue Bayou" drifts through the air. Soft, in the ether
somewhere. Creasy hears it, half raises his head.

                          PINTA'S VOICE
             Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where
             you're from?

She's standing behind him. Wearing the all too familiar
one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair.

                          CREASY
             Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta.     Like you.

                          PINTA GHOST
             Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but
             life is better.

                          CREASY
                    (smiles)
             Why are you here?

                          PINTA GHOST
             I have to watch you now.

CLOSE ON CREASY

The words are a salve, a balm.     He turns, looks back over
his shoulder. He's all alone.

INT.   SUV - NEAR RAMOS - MEXICO CITY - DAWN

Rayburn looks over his shoulder, sees Creasy walking down
the street. Clutching a teddy bear.

Creasy gets in the car.    Rayburn drives.

                          RAYBURN
             You'll be Stateside by suppertime.

No answer.   Finally, as Rayburn lights a cigarette...

                          CREASY
             I'm going to need help, Ray.

Rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what
just was asked. Creasy needs help unleashing a plague.

            Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day
            the shape you're in. Unless you stop
            bleeding you should have your spleen
            removed.

                           CREASY
            Yes or no?

                         RAYBURN
                   (after a beat)
            I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave
            that up. Anything else? It's yours.

Creasy reaches into a pocket, hands Rayburn a hand
written list. Rayburn reads, his eyes widening.

                         RAYBURN
            Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.

INT. PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY

The surface breaks as Creasy enters the water     wearing a
red T-shirt to hide the bandages. He begins      a slow
laborious stroke.  A pale attempt at getting     back into
shape. A ribbon of  maroon trails him through     the water.

INT. GARAGE - SUBURBS MEXICO CITY - NIGHT *RETHINK

Fluorescents flicker on. A Fiat up on the hydraulic
lift. A section of the garage is portioned off by heavy
steel sheeting with a padlocked door.

One of the two men unlocks it.      Creasy and Rayburn enter.

Creasy stops by the pistols.

                         CREASY
            I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.

                         RAYBURN
            I know it's old fashioned, but it's

Next he's looking at grenades.   He hefts two different
choices.

                         CREASY
            I need less than standard packing. Can
            you knock up a case for fifteen of each?

He picks up a double barrel shotgun, checks the line of
it. He flicks open the breach, snaps it shut.

                         CREASY
                   (indicating)
            Cut the stock here. The barrel here.

Creasy hangs up.

INT.   AFI OPERATION CENTER - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Manzano, Rosanna, and technicians are listening to voice
analysis tapes of various kidnappers. They're
struggling. Rosanna hands the piece of paper with the
license plate number to Manzano.

                          MANZANO
             He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death
             before he can do anything.

                          ROSANNA
             He sounded strong to me.      Stronger than
             we are.

Rosanna pauses.

                          ROSANNA
             Because he's outside. Because he's not
             tied to the same system we are.

                          MANZANO
             We did voice analysis of the last five
             high profile kidnappings, including the
             little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'.
             Listen to this.

Manzano plays back a recording of the Kidnapper.

                          VOICE
             "I used to run through the streets of
             Neza because I was scared of being fucked
             with. I swore one day I would cross the
             street walking. Now I walk."

                          ROSANNA
             He's protected by La Hermanidad.

                            MANZANO
             I know this.    Your point?

                          ROSANNA
             Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is
             he could be very valuable to us.

Rosanna waits for a response.    None.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       84.


                          ROSANNA
             Then what do you have to lose?

                          MANZANO
             It's a moral issue. On one hand you're
             cleaning up the bad guys, but in another
             way we are feeding the problem that
             produces bad guys.

Finally deciding, Manzano turns, holds out his hand.      As
Rosanna hands him the paper with the partial license
written on it.,

Creasy watches and waits.    Time lapse of the building

Jorge exits the building still trying to get the last
button of his police uniform closed. He's a cop. He
struggles to get behind the wheel of the Fiat. The car
is tiny.

Someone's getting in on the passenger side.

As Jorge starts to protest, Creasy rams a Sig into his
gut. At the same time, he takes Jorge's gun from its
holster.

                            CREASY
             Drive.

             Do you know who I am?

                          CREASY
             You are Jorge Ramirez.

Creasy jams him in the gut again.

                            CREASY
             Drive.

Jorge starts the engine.    As he eases out into traffic.

EXT.   CLIFFSIDE - MEXICAN CITY - DAY

A car graveyard sitting on top of a 300 foot cliff
overlooking a real tough barrio. Gravel crunches under
the Fiat's tires as it drives to the edge of a cliff.

                            CREASY'S VOICE
             Stop here.    Turn off the ignition.

INT.   FIAT 500 - DAY

Jorge does as he's told. Suddenly the Sig comes down
hard. WHACK! As Jorge's vision explodes...

INT.   FIAT 500 - DAY

Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes. The first thing
he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel
with his pudgy white fingers exposed. He is naked,
reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.

                          CREASY
             Can you hear me?

Jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding.

                          CREASY
             I am going to ask questions. If you
             don't answer, fully and truthfully, you
             will suffer much more than you have to.

Creasy opens Pinta's notebook to a blank page near the
end. He clicks open a pen.

Creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter.

Then he opens a buck knife.    Jorge winces at the sound of
the blade locking.

                          CREASY (CONT'D)
             I'm going to cut your fingers off.     One
             by one. If I have to.

The cigarette lighter pops back out.

                          CREASY
             That's to cauterize the stubs.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    86.


Holy sweet Jesus... Sweat drips down Jorge's forehead.
He tries to master his fear. Swallows dry.

                           JORGE
              Do you know who I am?

                             CREASY
              Who are you?

                           JORGE
              I am the President of La Hermanidad.

Without warning Creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a
flash of steel.

The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts
an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the
steering column. He is like a bucking Rhinoceros.

He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.

EXT.    FIAT 500 - DAY

The passenger side door opens and Creasy stumbles out.
Some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well.

Creasy wipes his tearing eyes. And then he turns.
Hefting the knife in his hand, he marches back toward the car.

                             JORGE'S VOICE
              No!   No!

And then a terrible SCREAM. BLOOD squirts against the
inside of the windshield. The car rocks on its shocks.
And then another terrible SCREAM.

                                                  CUT TO:

JORGE

Stares at the stump of his right forefinger, smoke rising
up off it. Creasy sticks the lighter back in its hole.

And Creasy looking at him, devoid of emotion.

                           JORGE
              Wh- wh- what do you want to know?

It takes a moment for Creasy to come back.    He picks up
the pen and notebook.

                           CREASY
              The Ramos kidnapping.   How did it work?

                         JORGE
            I don't know. We were just given
            instructions to take her.

                         CREASY
            Ordered by who?

Jorge hesitates.   As Creasy sets the pen down...

                            JORGE
            I don't know.

Creasy jerks back Jorge's middle finger, raises the
knife.

                         JORGE
                   (a mile a minute)
            I don't know! We work in parts. A    voice
            calls in a kidnapping. We deliver   the
            target to the guardians. We don't   even
            know them. They might transfer to   other
            guardians. The negotiators and the
            bosses don't even see the target.   They
            just make the deal!

                         CREASY
            Who ordered it?

                         JORGE
            The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.

                         CREASY
            Where do I find him?

                         JORGE
                   (shrugs; terrified)
            I don't know. No one knows.

CLOSE ON CREASY

Scream, as the knife comes down. Creasy tosses the finger
out the window, wipes some of Jorge's blood off his
cheek.

                         JORGE
            I don't know, I swear.

                         CREASY

             Me, too.    Tell me about the guardians.

                          JORGE
             He called me on the cell phone to set a
             time and location for the switch.

                            CREASY
             Who's he?

                          JORGE
             The one who transferred Pinta to their
             car.

FLASHBACKS: See Pinta being manhandled from the white
Fiat to the trunk of Grand Marquis. She has been bound
and taped around the mouth and eyes.

Creasy looks like he'll kill him on the spot.     Muzzles
his Sig into the palm of Jorge's right hand.

                            CREASY
             Who's he?

                          JORGE
             I don't know, but I know his face.

Creasy cocks the trigger.

                          JORGE
             I see him sometimes at the handball court
             in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.

                          CREASY
             How do I recognize him.

                          JORGE
             He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of
             his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.

Creasy closes the notebook, caps the pen.    It's over.

A gunshot echoes over the barrio. Creasy gets out of the
car, reaches back to release the emergency brake.

EXT.   VIA ARCO IRIS - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Kids playing SOCCER. One of them kicks an errant pass.
It skips down the street toward an approaching Creasy.

The kids shout for him to kick the ball back, but he
ignores them. As the kids curse him out, Creasy enters 1-
1-3...

BOOM UP alongside the building. A man steps to a third
floor window... man two who stuffed Pinta into the car.
His name is Sandri. And we're inside.

SANDRI (Italian Immigrant)

Putting his cufflinks through his shirt sleeves. Wearing
a shoulder holster. A satisfied smile as he looks back
into the room. At the bed. A 17-year-old GIRL under the
sheet.

                           GIRL
                    (nods)
             When will I see you again?

Pulling  on his suit coat, Sandri steps to the door. He
mimes a  pistol action with his forefinger and thumb. He
opens it  to find himself staring square into the eyes of
Creasy.   He rests the twin barrels of the sawed-off
shotgun  square against Sandri's chest.

                          CREASY
             Her name was Pinta.

Sandri registers the name.   Creasy swings the shotgun
down to Sandri's groin.

EXT.   PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY

Creasy swimming toward the far wall. As he rolls, kicks
off, it's Pinta who emerges from the bubbles swimming
back the over way.

Pinta swims through the a maroon cloud filtering through
the water.

                                              CUT TO:

CU of Pinta's diary. Creasy opens it up. The bullet
sits in the center crease. He thumbs through the pages
stopping on different days. Pinta's V.O. Illustrating
those pages.

EXT. CHAPULTEPEC PARK - DAY

Handball court. Intense game with big money stakes. A
sea of criminal faces cheer on the gladiators from the
bleachers. It's a close match.

A 200 pound Guardian removes his T-shirt before serving.
Turns to reveal a huge tattoo across two-thirds of his
back. Creasy registers his prey.

EXT. BARRIO SUNSET

A small Russian Taurus crests a hill and descends into
Hell. A frightening looking Barrio. Burnt out cars and
dead dogs line the sidewalks. Creasy tails the Guardian
on his moped into the center of a trash dump. The focal
point being a semi-derelict church within a gated
compound. Our 'tattooed handball genius' exits the
Taurus. Reaches in back for the groceries.

INT.   GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - SUNSET

A knock. GUARDIAN TWO steps over, carries a pistol.     He
slides back a speakeasy slot to reveal our tattooed
Guardian.

                           GUARDIAN TWO
             Hola!

EXT.   DOOR - SUNSET

Guardian One stands at the slot. Creasy is pressed up
against the wall out of sight. He holds the shotgun
wrapped in a ragged beach towel.

As the door unlocks and opens and Guardian One steps in,
Creasy slides in right behind him.

As the butt of the shotgun makes contact with Guardian
Two's mouth. Blood spouts as his front teeth are smashed
in.

As he raises his hands to his face, the pistol he holds
discharges into the ceiling. Guardian One watches as
Creasy clubs him again in the head.

Frightened footsteps running on the other side of a
plywood wall. A female voice yelling from the other
room. Creasy gauges their whereabouts.

BOOM!    Creasy fires into the wall.    Wall explodes.

Guardian Three freezes mid stride.      It's a tough looking
woman in her 40's.

INT. GRUBBY KITCHEN ROOM - DAY

The three guardians stand facing the wall. Hands bound
with tape or cuffed. Naked (like our 18 year old) other
than their dirty skivvies.

Creasy holds up a picture of Pinta.      An I.D. picture
taken from her schoolbook.

                           CREASY
              Tell me about the girl.

All three look...and with a strange defiant arrogance.

                           GUARDIAN ONE
              Who the fuck's that?

BOOM! BOOM!    Creasy kills Guardian One.

INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:

The two Guardians each bound in two different rooms.
Both have their eyes taped shut. Creasy interrogates
Guardian Two.

              Everything on the cellphone. We wait for
              calls. We have no number to call.

Creasy picks a cell phone up off the table, hits redial.
It's a blocked line.

pocket as he lies on the floor.

              He was screaming about the money and his
              dead nephew. He threw the little girl

The Female Guardian points. Creasy steps over.       There's
a smear of BLOOD against the wall.

                           FEMALE GUARDIAN
              She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw

And Creasy stands there a moment. Realizes she is
telling the truth. Lost. And the sound that snaps him
out of it... A GIRL CRYING. And Creasy is suddenly
moving down...

THE HALLWAY

After the sound.    He kicks open a door.       There!

In a 8' X 4' room.       A 12-year-old GIRL.    Bound and

the little girl's hand. She has the same lost look he
does. Female Guardian in the back of car.

                            CREASY
             Camila.

The girl looks up at the name.

                           CREASY
                    (into phone)
             I've got her.

EXT.   ICE CREAM STAND - BUSY MEXICAN CITY STREET - NIGHT

Creasy hands the girl an ice cream cone. He looks over
as Rosanna hurries over from across the street.

Creasy puts the little girl's hand into Rosanna's.

                          CREASY
             I need something. Do you have banking
             connections?

                          ROSANNA
                    (hesitates, then...)
             I have connections.

Creasy hands her the ATM card.

                          CREASY
             The PIN number is 4-7-4-7.    I need to
             know whose account it is.

Rosanna notices the blood on Creasy's shirt.    Near his
stomach.

                          ROSANNA
             Where do I find you?

                          CREASY
             I'll call you tomorrow.

Creasy looks at the girl and starts off, then looks back.

                          CREASY
             What do you know about the cop?
             Tazinari. The one who made the ransom
             drop with Samuel Ramos?

                          ROSANNA
             He's an old fashioned patrone with the
             worst reputation. He's high on my hit
             list.

                          CREASY
             Where does he live?

                          ROSANNA
             He lives in a Judicial Compound. He
             travels by motorcade. He has better
             protection than George Bush. Even more
             importantly he is part of La Hermanidad.
             His reach is far and wide.

                          CREASY
             Give me the address.

SAFEHOUSE WITH ROSANNA.

INT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ - NIGHT

A beehive. Cops. Photos of dead kidnappers on the wall:
Jorge and Sandri. Sandri emasculated, one hand missing.
Jorge behind the wheel, fingers stubs and a missing ear.

                          ADJUTANT
             Two in one day. And they died very
             badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime
             suspects in twelve kidnappings in the
             last six months.

Manzano studies the photo of Jorge.

                         MANZANO
            Whoever did this was methodical,
            unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the
            photos we showed Creasy?

                         ADJUTANT
            No, I checked. But right   after Sandri
            was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found
            naked, hysterical in the  street. She
            said it was a man fitting  Creasy's
            description who shot him.

                         MANZANO
            Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a
            very lethal human being.

                         ADJUTANT
            You don't seem very surprised?

Manzano looks at his Adjutant, pleased with his
perception. But he isn't sharing.

                         MANZANO
            What's surprising these days?

An AFI agent brings over a plate of red shredded chicken.
Manzano takes a bite, moans in pleasure.

                           MANZANO
            Your sister?    Only a virgin cooks like
            this.

SURVEILLANCE ROOM

Seen through a two-way mirror.   Manzano watches as...

Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor.
Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly,
his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as,
slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of
him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing.

Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still
closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a
laugh.

Rayburn opens his eyes, looks over as Manzano enters.
Still eating, he hands Rayburn a second plate of chicken.

                         MANZANO
            Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo
            sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in
            lemon and orange juice. It's a stew
            really.

                         RAYBURN
                   (sets it down)
            I already ate.

Manzano enjoys another bite, then...

                         MANZANO
            Tell me about your friend Creasy.

                         RAYBURN
            You just said it. He's my friend.
            Nothing else to say.

                         MANZANO
            I read the file. You and Creasy have
            seen quite a bit together.

                         RAYBURN
            Two tourists who never went home.

                         MANZANO
            You helped him get this job.

                         RAYBURN
            That's what friends do.

                         MANZANO
            Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you,
            others will do it as well. Their
            facilities are as good as my own, if not
            better.

                         RAYBURN
            I can take care of myself.

                         MANZANO
            You and Creasy both. A two man army
            according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon
            with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you
            were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt
            down elite Iraqi military commanders.
                   (laughs)

            The kind that gets divorced, but still
            stay friends.

                         MANZANO
            What happened to him?   What happened to
            Creasy?

Rayburn flinches at some bitter memory.

                         RAYBURN
            None of your business. Or mine for that
            matter. I got nothing more to say.

                         MANZANO
            This is my jurisdiction. I want these
            men as much as Creasy does.

                         RAYBURN
            He'll deliver more justice in a weekend,
            than ten years of your courts and
            tribunals. So stay out of his way.

                         MANZANO
            I plan to. I'll even help him if I can.
            He's going to lead me to the 'The
            Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly.
            But I'd like to understand him. Give me
            that.

                         RAYBURN
            Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to
            you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a
            number. One more dead.

                         MANZANO
            What was she to Creasy then?

                         RAYBURN
            Light. At the end of a long, dark
            tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was
            alright to live again.

                         MANZANO
            And they took that away.

                         RAYBURN
            A man can be an artist in anything.
            Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if
            his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is
            death. And he's about to paint his
            masterpiece.

The words sink in.   Manzano understands their magnitude.

             favor and let me the fuck out of here...

EXT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Framed commendations fall to the carpet as Rosanna slams
up against the wall of Manzano's office. Skirt up around
her waist, Manzano moves inside of her. Between breaths:

                          MANZANO
             Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl
             that was kidnapped yesterday.

                          ROSANNA
             And left three more dead men.

She bites the heel of his palm to keep from crying out.

                          MANZANO
             When you talked to him, did he look sane?

                         ROSANNA
             No. Not by the rules of polite society
             at least.

                          MANZANO
             I think he's... magnificent.

As they both climax, pressed up hard against each
other...

                          MANZANO
                    (smiles)
             You only fuck me to get information.

He kisses her, turned on again already.

             Let's put Creasy to press. There's a

                    (as he takes card)
             I should start going for your tits first.

EXT. SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Underwater as Pinta swims. As she spins, kicks off the
wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side. A plume
of red blossoming off his side.

This is done over and over, faster and faster, closer and
closer. The blood becomes darker, bigger. And we push
into that blood until it's finally obscuring everything.

EXT.   NEWSSTAND - MEXICO CITY - EARLY MORNING

A row of newspapers being set out.     Creasy's face on the
front page of every one of them.

EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING

A quaint old Mexico neighborhood. We follow a long
canvas bag being carried through the streets. Carried by
Creasy. Toward the end of the street and a ground floor
apartment. Walks past a canary yellow Coup deVille,
which has seen better days.

INT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - MORNING

An elderly couple eating lunch. The HUSBAND looks over
at a knock on the door. He stands, answers it. Creasy
slides in, eases the door shut behind him. Gun in hand.

             I'm not here to hurt you. I need to

A military operation as Tazinari is led out to his car.
Two heavy gray sedans wait. Tazinari gets in the back of

Creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two
chairs.

             If you promise to speak softly and not to
             shout, I won't have to tape your mouths.

The old man looks to his wife, then back to Creasy.
Nods.

The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls
out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a
ROCKET LAUNCHER. Next he pulls out a cone-shaped
missile. The old man is starting to look curious.

                          CREASY
             Did you know you have a dishonest
             policeman living in your neighborhood?

Creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it
back into the tube.

                          OLD MAN
             I know of you. You're the American. The
             bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.

Creasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room.

                          OLD MAN
             In the church, they say to forgive.

                          CREASY
             Forgiveness is between them and God.
             It's my job to arrange the meeting.

Creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows
and in a line to the wall with a household Catholic
alter. Christ on the cross sits front and center.

                          CREASY
             Do you have an old blanket you don't care
             about? I don't want to burn that wall.

A figure rises, framed in the window.

And Pinta stands beside him.   As she puts her fingers in
her ears...

Creasy fires the rocket launcher. A gout of flame erupts
from the back. But Creasy has hung a blanket on the
wall.

Eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them.
The driver stands on the brakes. The car explodes, is
obliterated really, from the inside out.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Tazinari's car slams into the debris of the lead car and
slides sideways against a wall wedging it in. Real
tight.

CREASY

A 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust. A
shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left
hand.

Without missing  a stride he unloads both barrels into the
drivers window.   A scary prospect even though it's bullet-
proof. The lit   Molotov explodes beneath the car.
Silence. Then a   dull impact explosion. 30 feet of
flames envelope  the car. The driver and Tazinari both
prisoners inside  their own car.

The driver exits releasing a full clip from his Uzi.
Creasy nails him with a single shot to the head.

Tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air.

There sits the canary yellow Coupe deVille. Eyes and
mouth taped shut, hands and ankles bound by flex-cuffs.
Tazinari stands there.

Creasy steps up, pulls the tape off Tazinari's eyes.     He
looks about, relatively calm considering.

             You know where you are?

            went down?

Creasy tears the tape off his mouth.

                         TAZINARI
            Do you know who I am? I am the

            Hermanidad.

                           TAZINARI
            Correct!

Creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips  it
open. As Tazinari reacts, Creasy spins him round,   slits
his clothes up from ankle to neck. The cloth drops   away,
some hanging at Tazinari's wrists. Tazinari has a   sudden
loss of attitude.

side view mirrors of the Coupe deVille.

Cut back to see Tazinari, naked other than his Calvin
Klein skivvies, spread-eagled across the grill of the
car, butt forward (Reminiscent of 'the woods scene' in

Creasy rips down his Calvins. CU of Tazinari's face
winces with either pain or extreme discomfort.

Creasy puts a tape recorder on the hood and presses the
record button.

                         TAZINARI
            I don't know him. I saw the opportunity
            and got lucky.

                           CREASY
            Lucky how?

                         TAZINARI
            That he used policemen. That you killed
            them, it made it a police matter. The

            You stole the drop.

            You done it before?

Tazinari doesn't answer.   Creasy gives the Magnum a
tweak.

                          TAZINARI
            Yes.   Many times.

            O.K.   So tell me more.

                         TAZINARI
            There was no ten million dollars.

                         CREASY
            The ransom was ten.

             Two and a half. That's how much there
             was.

             Maybe your men stole from you.

                           TAZINARI
             No. Whoever took the rest took it before
             the exchange.

             Who gave the bags to Ramos?

                           TAZINARI
             His lawyer.   Jordan Kalfus.

FLASHBACK: Ramos House. Bags of cash being switched
from the Mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd Mercedes
in the garage. See that Jordan does the switch, four
bags on the floor.

He isn't doing well. The cloud of deep red emanating
from his stomach envelopes his whole body.

INT.   DINING ROOM - EVENING

Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into
space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot
survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.

The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the
deserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a
dinner guest.

                          CREASY
                    (to Samuel)
             I'm going to talk to your wife. If you
             move or say one word, I'll kill you.

He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns
to Lisa.

                          CREASY
             I'm going to tell you a story. Your
             lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him
             talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million
             into his U.S. bank account. Colonel
             Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He
             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
             million. If my arithmetic is correct it
             means $5 million remains.

Creasy looks to Samuel.

                          CREASY
             Your husband magically had five million
             deposited in a U.S. bank account last
             Friday.

Lisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern
whether this is true or not.

                          CREASY
             They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.

                             LISA
             Planned what?

                         CREASY
            An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for
            Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm
            sure he thought she'd sit there for three
            days eating pizza and watching TV. It
            didn't work out that way. Everything got
            fucked up when I killed the cops and
            Tazinari saw an opportunity.

Lisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.

                         CREASY
            On the surface it was low risk and high
            return. This was the third autosequestra
            Jordan had organized for clients. The
            other two succeeded.

Samuel looks to Lisa.

                          SAMUEL
            Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain
            and weakness only fueled your anger and
            determination. I wasn't sure about
            whether to go through with it or not.
            Then I woke up one day and it was done.
                   (beat)
            Jordan was supposed to take care of it.

Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special
bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.     He
empties the other cartridges from his gun.

Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional
outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood
from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms
beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the
first time.

Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's
eyes.

                         CREASY
            A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells
            the truth. And the truth will set you
            free.

Creasy hands Samuel the gun.

                         CREASY
            In many ways I think this bullet should
            be shared between you and Lisa.

Creasy exits the room. Samuel kisses Lisa on the
forehead and exits onto the terrace.

A GUNSHOT.

EXT.   MEXICO CITY - NIGHT

Life moves on with its brutal inevitability.    This is a
river whose course cannot be altered.

                          PINTA'S VOICE
             From the backseat I can see   Creasy's eyes
             in the mirror. He watches    and thinks.
             He never smiles. I wish I    was back in
             the front seat with him. I    wish he would
             smile.

Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city.
And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless.

It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what
to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials
a number on a cell phone.

INT. AFI OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

Back on Rosanna. We see she's sitting in the AFI
Operations Center amongst Technicians, surveillance and
listening devices, and Manzano.

We can hear the interior of a family house, kids, a
frustrated mother, a Mexican soap playing in the B.G.,
over speakers.

                         TECHNICIAN
                   (to Manzano)
            We got the whole place wiretapped. But

                           MANZANO
            He'll show.

Manzano is carrying a 8" X 10" digital blow up of a
handsome Mexican John Gotti type in some nightclub
environment.

            Who's that?

                         MANZANO
            He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got
            into the house on the pretext of giving
            cholera shots. We had to inject the
            whole Barrio. We bugged the house and
            stole the picture of him. Manzano looks
            at Rosanna. Now's the time to really
            pressure him. Lets publish his picture
            in tomorrow's edition.

INT.   CLOSED RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The OWNER watches nervously as   Creasy approaches wearing
a wool CAP. A pale attempt at    disguising his identity.
There's a newspaper folded on   his dais, more photos of
Creasy, his dead targets, the   story of his vendetta.

Empty restaurant, chairs  on tables. An    exterior
streetlight illuminates  the darkness.    The owner leads
him down a row of empty  booths. Creasy    slows, stops as
he sees the only person  waiting for him   is Manzano. As
Manzano smiles.

            What do you want?

            The same thing as you. Except, my reach
            isn't as long as yours. My father was a
            policemen, did you know that?

                         CREASY
            I don't know shit about you.

                         MANZANO
            He was one of the original founders of
            'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it
            represented good not evil.

Manzano smiles; he likes Creasy.

                         MANZANO
            He was murdered. And now here I am.
            Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by
            bureaucracy and corruption. The

            criminals at the highest level where I
            would need a Presidential finding in

            It galls me to watch you. You can do as
            much in days as I can in years. Men like
            the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of

            Are you going to arrest me or talk me to
            death?

Manzano laughs again.   Genuine.   Creasy cracks him up.

                         MANZANO
            My country needs justice. Proper
            justice. Gunning men down in the street
            only feeds the violence. They need to
            be brought to trial. Dealt with
            properly.
            Then people will respect the law. When
            they see it works.

            So you are going to talk me to death.

                         MANZANO
            You walk out and deal justice. You're
            what I wish I could be.
                   (another laugh, then a beat)

            I want to arrest you for murder! I want
            to shake your hand and reload your gun!
            I want to kill my pride and give you my

                            MANZANO
               Account belongs to a woman we think is
               The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas,
               who is 8 months pregnant.

Creasy holds his hand out.     Manzano hesitates.

                            MANZANO
               The plan is the girlfriend will lead you
               to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll
               arrest him. Agreed?

Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the
paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it.
Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts
out.

                            MANZANO
               Creasy...
                      (Creasy turns)
               I'd have liked to have known you under
               different circumstances.

                            CREASY
               Off the top of my head, I don't know what
               they could've been.

As Creasy departs...

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

A tiered house built into the rock face that runs through
Mexico City. A scooter is parked. A man sits on it
waiting, wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well
known features. Creasy.

CREASY - VIDEO FEED

It's difficult to say where they are coming from. The
view passes from one screen to another. As Creasy's
passes, we hear the whispered crackle of radio
communications.

GROUND LEVEL

CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out.
Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is
indelibly imprinted on his brain.

It's not "The Dreamer."    Not as handsome, but there's a
resemblance.

The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first
and then enters.

Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the
magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his
shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle
approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door
from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his
bicycle through the doorway.

Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he
strides across the street. "Man on Fire."

The bicycle makes it in.    And the door is closing...

Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.

INT.   HALLWAY - DAY

The pregnant woman, Reina Rosas, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER
as Creasy fills the space behind her. Creasy follows as
she runs.

LIVING ROOM

Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two
other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to
Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets.

We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's
down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina
is screaming.

Hear a door torn open. Creasy      moves to the sound.   A
MAN has run out the back...

EXT. HOUSE - BACK COURTYARD

Creasy steps into courtyard, turns, a VW Bug coming right
at him...

Aims his weapon.

THE MAN

Ducks down... windshield shatters from the blast of
Creasy's shotgun... Bug slams into wall. The Man rolls
out... using the door as a shield.

BARRIO

The Man   flees into a labyrinth of packing-crate houses on
car-tire   foundations out into street. Running hard, too
hard for   Creasy in his condition. He is losing a lot of
blood.    He stops.

CREASY

Behind the wheel of the Volkswagon, roars out chasing.

Now through the maze of poverty... Creasy drives hard...
no sign of the Man... empty eyes of poverty looking
back... mostly women and children... They clearly see
Creasy... fully exposed... driving a car with no
windshield... He slams the car into reverse.

Someone says "Creasy" aloud... now more faces to turn...
children looking directly through his absent windshield.

One skinny kid runs ahead of Creasy. The boy points at
one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco
wall.

INT. VOLKSWAGON

Creasy pops the clutch... straight into a small house...
taking whole walls of cardboard... to the back brick
wall... The 'Man' is pinned violently between the car and
the wall.

INT.   LIVING ROOM - REINA ROSAS HOUSE - DAY

The Man badly broken and bleeding lies on the floor, flex-
cuffed. Reina screams at Creasy. Creasy's popping
Percodan's. The hysteria is peaking. Creasy chambers a
round and shoots man through left knee. Screams then
silence.

                            CREASY
             Reina Rosas.

                          CREASY
             How do you contact 'the Boss'?

Reina hesitates.

Creasy chambers another round and holds the gun to man's
right knee.

                          REINA

tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very
illogical subject.

DANIEL hangs up.

Aurillio moans on the floor. Reina says the rosary. The

               Creasy.   She calls the bear 'Creasy

Time stands still for Creasy.        Words evaporate.    Liquid
film in Creasy's eyes.

CLOSE UP of Creasy's shocked face. He pulls down his

            Then don't come.

He disconnects.   He cannot waste his ebbing strength.

EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSET

Darkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as
Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...
looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks
his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos
Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is
driving. She exits the car.

She runs to catch Creasy.

                         LISA
            Creasy... Wait.

                         CREASY
            Stay here. If you do something stupid,
            we won't get her back.

He climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his
dignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the
other side.

OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV

Creasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A
driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.
A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants
exits the car. Confused. Disoriented.

CREST OF THE BRIDGE

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     124.


Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.

OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

The driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from
under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.

The small figure is confused.

CREST OF THE BRIDGE

Creasy calls out:

                             CREASY
               Pinta.   Pinta.

She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even
under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across
the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming
train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
bridge.

Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
nothing.

She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
experience she just endured has been life changing. All
of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
body.

She wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We
glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we
do not hear the words.

She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.
Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.

Before she goes to her mother we hear:

                            PINTA
               I love you, Creasy... And you love me,
               right?

Creasy nods.    The inference is that he will see her in a
few minutes.

We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the
wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across
to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the
kidnappers' car.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          125.


There's a certain sort of calm of him.
He closes the door, he lays his head against the back
window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the
bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou"
gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is
not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the
back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.
As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay
his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down
into a dark tunnel.

Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can
hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As
"Blue Bayou" continues...

EXT.    MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY

Dark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the
roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in
blocking position. The driver turns and looks back
wanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van
right on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.

SWAT at his door.    He's pulled and proned out onto the
road.

Manzano enters the driver's seat.       Reaching back to
Creasy. Grabs his hand.

                           MANZANO
              I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.

Manzano does a U-turn.    Heading away.     On his portable
radio.

                          MANZANO
              All units. Commence the operation.
              Repeat. Commence.

He reaches back again.

                            MANZANO
              Creasy?   Creasy?

CLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.

Creasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip.         Then
no response. Manzano pulls to the curb.

Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist.       Takes his pulse.
Creasy's gone.

Beat.

Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     126.


Manzano kneels.   Still holding Creasy.   Unfolds Creasy's
fingers.

CLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his
hand.

Manzano punches the seat again again and again.

                           MANZANO
            Goddamn you.

                   (keys mic)
            Hold at the perimeter.   Until I enter.

EXT. DANIEL'S COMPOUND

Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds
the corner. Security outside the compound motions to
open the garage doors. The driver of the car is
faceless. Street light reflections across the
windshield.

The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies
appear in the courtyard curious to see this national
hero. "Hombre en Fuego."

The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.
A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The
driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.

Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An
overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the
courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.

Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.
He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the
mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in
the other.

Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'
little Jack Russell running back to his master on
instinct.

Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment
is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway
to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at
the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The

FADE IN:

INT. VOID - DAY

Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit
nervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a
needy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and
he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman
special.

Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Hallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my
	movie.
		(beat; he gets upset)
	I hoped the story of my life would
	be nice...but it turned out
	terrible!  It is all LIES!  Tings
	are mixed up... real people I knew
	play different people.  WHAT A MESS!
	So I broke into Universal and cut
	out the junk.  Now it's much
	shorter.  In fact, this is the end
	of the movie.  So tanks for comink!
	Bye-bye!

Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING
CREDITS MUSIC starts to play.  FINAL CREDITS roll.

Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience.
Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and
restarts the music.  He does that as many times as the
credits require.

Finally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in.
DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.

		ANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)
	Okay!  Just my friends are left.  I
	wanted to get rid of those other
	people... they would have laughed in
	the wrong places.
		(beat)
	I was only kidding about the
	movie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD!
	It shows everything... from me as a
	little boy until my death --
		(his eyes pop; he
		covers his mouth)
	Oops!!  I wasn't supposed to talk
	about that!  Oh.  Eh, uh, we better
	just begin.  It starts back in Great
	Neck, Long Island...

Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on.
WHIR!  He smiles at the flickering light.

		ANDY
	Oh, yes.  I remember it well...

We PUSH INTO the white light.  It fills our frame, blazing
whiter, whiter...

				      DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY

A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.  Great Neck,
1957.  An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street,
crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat
convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY
KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well-
meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.

Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his
son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack!
-- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles.

		STANLEY
	That's my boy!  Good swingin',
	kiddo.
		(warm beat; then a
		look)
	Hey -- Michael... where's your
	brother?

		MICHAEL
	He's inside.

Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.  He frowns angrily,
then snatches his briefcase and marches in.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY

Baby CAROL is crying.  Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels
carrots, trying to get dinner made.  Stanley marches past.

		STANLEY
	Is he in his room?

		JANICE
	Of course he's in his room.
		(aggravated)
	All his "friends" are in there.

Stanley glowers.  He huffs upstairs.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY

Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door.  We hear little Andy
doing VOICES.

		ANDY (O.S.)
		(as WORRIED GIRL)
	But professor, why are the monsters
	growing so big?
		(now as BRITISH
		PROFESSOR)
	It's something in the jungle water.
	I need to crack the secret code.

Stanley rolls his eyes.  He opens the door...

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY

...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall.  Andy is
happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting.

		ANDY
		(as BRITISH
		PROFESSOR)
	Maybe I should talk to the natives.
		(as dancing NATIVES)
	Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo
	ba --

		STANLEY
	Andy!

		ANDY
		(startled)
	Oh!

The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward.
Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son.

		STANLEY
	Andy, this has to stop.  Our house
	isn't a television station.  There
	is not a camera in that wall.

Andy glances over at the wall.  Hmm.

		STANLEY (cont'd)
		(trying to cope)
	Son... listen to me.  It isn't
	healthy.  You should be outside,
	playing sports.

		ANDY
	But I've got a sports show.
	Championship wrestling, at five.

		STANLEY
		(he blows his top)
	You know that's not what I meant!
	Look, I'm gonna put my foot down!
	No more playing alone.  You wanna
	perform, you GOTTA have an audience!

		ANDY
		(he points at the
		wall)
	B-but I have them.

		STANLEY
	No!  That is NOT an audience!  That
	is PLASTER!  An audience is people
	made of flesh!  They -- live and
	breathe!  Got it?!

Andy thinks, considering his options.  Then, he nods.
						CUT TO:

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY

Baby Carol sits in her crib.  Andy's hands suddenly YANK her
out.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY

Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor.  She
dutifully sits there, deadpan.

Andy returns to the center of the room.  He resumes his
show.

		ANDY
		(as KIDDIE SHOW
		HOST)
	And now, boys and girls!  It's time
	for... TV Fun House!
		(he makes an
		APPLAUSE SOUND)
	Hi, everybody!  Are you ready for a
	singalong?  I'll say the animal, and
	you make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay!
		(he starts to SING)
	"Oh, the cow goes........."

Carol stares, unblinking.  Then --

		CAROL
	Moo.

		ANDY
		(he smiles, pleased)
	"And the dog goes......"

		CAROL
	WOOF!

		ANDY
	"And the cat says......"

				      DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

TIGHT on ANDY, now GROWN UP.  26-years-old, still performing
the song.

		DRUNK AUDIENCE
	MEOW!!

WIDE - It's a small, hip New York nightclub.

		ANDY
	"And the bird says..."

		DRUNK AUDIENCE
	TWEET!!

		ANDY
	"And the lion goes..."

		DRUNK AUDIENCE
	ROAR!!

		ANDY
	"And that's the way it goes!"
		(he grins)
	Thank you.  Goodbye!

Andy waves and bows.  There's faint scattered applause.

Andy sighs.  An irritated MANAGER steps onstage.  He shoots
Andy a disgruntled look, then takes the mike.

		MANAGER
	The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman,
	Ladies and Gentlemen!

In the b.g., Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets,
conga drums, a phonograph... it all goes into a big bulky
case.

					  CUT TO:

INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT

The club is empty.  At the bar, the manager cleans up.  Andy
eagerly comes over.  Offstage, his presence is soft, placid
-- his voice barely above a whisper.

		ANDY
	So, Mr. Besserman, same slot
	tomorrow...?

		MANAGER
		(awkward)
	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm...
	thinkin' of letting you go...

		ANDY
	You're firing me??
		(beat)
	You don't even pay me!

		MANAGER
	Look -- I don't wanna seem
	insulting.  But... your act is like
	amateur hour: Singalongs...
	puppets... playing records...

A stunned beat.  Andy is hurt.

		ANDY
	What do you want?  "Take my wife,
	please"??

		MANAGER
	Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the
	traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a
	little blue material...

		ANDY
	I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what
	everyone else does!

		MANAGER
	Well, everyone else gets this place
	cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to
	move the booze when you're singin'
	"Pop Goes The Weasel."

Andy stares, disheartened.
		   MANAGER (cont'd)
	I'm sorry.  You're finished here.

An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying.

The manager is dumbfounded.  He doesn't know what to do.

Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks.  The manager
is confused -- totally disoriented.  Shamed, Andy covers his
face, then runs out.  Silence.  The manager stares after
him... having no idea what just happened.

EXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

Sobbing Andy bursts out the door.  He steps onto the
sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING.  Just like that.

Andy lifts his big case and starts walking.  Andy shakes his
head angrily.

He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an
unsavory New York neighborhood.  But then... TWO MEN
appear... silently approaching.  Andy stops uncertainly --
debating whether to turn around.  But in that second -- the
thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.

		THUG #1
	Give us your wallet.

Andy stares fearfully.  An anxious moment.  He thinks...
considering his options.

Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	I -- doo not unterstand!!

		THUG #1
	Give us your money!

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	What??  What mooney?  Abu daboo!  I
	do not have mooney!

The thugs glance at each other.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	Pleaze!  I just move to America
	yezterday!  I do not know!

		THUG #1
	What's in the case?

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	NO!  Eeet, eet is just perzonal
	trifles from my homeland --

		THUG #2
	Shut up!  Gimme that thing!

The guy snatches the case.  He impulsively BREAKS the
lock... and clothes, congas and records fall out.

The thugs are dismayed.

		THUG #1
	Goddamn immigrants!

		THUG #2
	This guy's pathetic.  Let's go.

Harsh glances.  They angrily turn and leave.

Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things
off the street.  He shouts after the guys:

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Tank you veddy much...!

					 CUT TO:

EXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT

The Improv, the biggest comedy club around.  People are
lined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a
Hollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx
accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness
that is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and
waves George in.

INT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT

The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.  A few
turn and smile -- "George!"  "Hey, George!"  George takes a
couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into
the...

INT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT

Where the show's in progress.  Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees
George and gives him a bear-hug.  Then he hustles George to
a table.

George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention.
Up there is a WISEASS COMIC.

		WISEASS COMIC
	So I'm getting my mother-in-law a
	special Christmas present: A pre-
	paid funeral!  The mortician asked
	me if I wanted her buried, embalmed
	or cremated.  I said, "Make it all
	three!  I'm not takin' any chances!"
		(the crowd LAUGHS)
	Thank you.  Good night!
The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely
claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.

We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly
steps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink
jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in
headlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various
junk, and arranges it on chairs.

The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is.
Andy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Now?  Now...?
		(looking around)
	Tank you veddy much.  I am very
	happy to be here.  I tink -- this is
	a very beautiful place.  But one
	ting I do not like is too much
	traffic.  Tonight I had to come
	from, eh, and the freeway, it was so
	much traffic.  It took me an hour
	and a half to get here!

Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline.

Silence.  The crowd is baffled.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	But -- talking about the terrible
	things: My wife.  Take my wife,
	please take her.

Yikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS.

Andy gestures, as if they got the joke.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	No really, I am only foolink.  I
	love my wife very much.  But she
	don't know how to cook.  You know,
	one time, she make a steak and
	mashed potato.  Ehh, and the night
	before, she make spaghetti and
	meatballs.  Her cooking is so bad...
	is terrible.

People are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple
hipsters laugh mockingly.

George leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow.
		     ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	Right now, I would like to do for
	you some imitations.  So first, I
	would like to imitate Archie Bunker.
		(no change in his
		voice)
	"You stupid, everybody ees stupid!
	Ehh, get, get out of my chair
	Meathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat
	get into the kitchen, making the
	food!  Ehh, everybody ees stupid!  I
	don't like nobody, ees so stupid!"
	Tank you veddy much.
		(pleased, he proudly
		bows)
	Now I would like to imitate Jimmy
	Carter, the President of the United
	States.
		(no change in his
		voice)
	"Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the
	President of the United States."

Some people BOO and walk out.  A few giggle, getting into
the groove.

George is intrigued.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	And now... I would like to imitate
	the Elvis Presley.

A woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns
his back to us.  He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER...
and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.

House lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls
tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his
pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.

He combs his hair.

Then he brushes his hair.

Then he combs his hair some more.

Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins
around.

He is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT.

The crowd is blown away.

Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis
swaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage
right and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for
another bow.

Music STOPS.

		ANDY (AS ELVIS)
	Thank you very much.

Wow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.  This man is Elvis.

Suddenly -- "JAILHOUSE ROCK" guitar kicks in.

		ANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd)
		(SINGING)
	"Warden threw a party
	In the county jail!
	Prison band was there
	And they BEGAN to WAIL!"

ANGLE - GEORGE

He is astonished.  George cannot quite figure out what's
going on... but he wants in.

He waves Budd over.  Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS.

		GEORGE
	Pst.  What's the story with this
	guy?

		BUDD
	I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us
	can understand him.

George nods admiringly.

		GEORGE
	He does a hell of an Elvis.

					  CUT TO:

INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is packing up his things.  He very methodically folds
each item of clothing, then checks the creases.

George strolls up.

		GEORGE
	Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Tank you veddy much.

		GEORGE
	So I understand you're from
	Lithuania?

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	No.  Caspiar.

George is puzzled.

		GEORGE
	Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	It's a veddy small island in de
	Caspian Sea.
		(beat)
	It sunk.
		 GEORGE
	Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.
		(beat)
	Well, look, I'm probably out of my
	mind -- but I think you're very
	interesting.  If you ever need
	representation... we should talk.

George hands him a BUSINESS CARD.  Andy reads it -- then his
eyes pop.  He DROPS the accent.

		ANDY
	Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!

George realizes it's all been an act.  He laughs heartily.

		GEORGE
	Caspiar, huh?!

					  CUT TO:

INT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie
waitresses in sandals.  Andy and George sit together, trying
to get a sense of each other.

		ANDY
	You see, I want to be the biggest
	star in the world.

George is surprised at this hubris.

		GEORGE
	People love... comedians.

		ANDY
	I'm not a comedian.  I have no
	talent.
		(he shrugs)
	I'm a song-and-dance man.

George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant
MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril.

George cringes.  He doesn't know what to say.

A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD
-- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy
beams.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Mmm!  I particularly recommend the
	Lotus root.

Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands.
Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little
piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles.

George peers at the bizarre food behavior.
		   GEORGE
	You show a lot of promise... but...
	my concern is I don't know where to
	book you.  You're not a stand-up...
	your act doesn't exactly translate
	to films... help me... where do you
	see yourself?

		ANDY
		(bright)
	I've always wanted to play Carnegie
	Hall.

George is unsure if that's a joke.

		GEORGE
	Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny.

Andy dips his silverware in the water glass.  Two dunks,
then he dries it with his napkin.

George stares, perplexed.  He looks back up -- and Andy's
booger has suddenly switched nostrils.

Huh?

		ANDY
	See, I don't want easy laughs.

Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent
prayer.  George raises an eyebrow.  Andy snaps his head back
up.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I want gut reactions!  I want that
	audience to go through an
	experience.  They love me!  They
	hate me!  They walk out -- it's all
	GREAT!

Andy triumphantly eats a bean.  George peers, unable to take
the booger anymore.  He hands Andy a napkin and points to
his nose.  Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and
carefully puts it in a little box.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	After I'm famous, I can sell these
	as "Worn by Andy Kaufman."

And at that... George is won over.  He smiles broadly.

		GEORGE
	You're insane.
		(then sincere)
	But -- you might also be brilliant.
	Alright, Andy... let's do it.

George warmly extends his hand.

Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.  The men
shake.  A moment of supreme importance.
EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

The glitz strip of Los Angeles.  Money.  Beauty.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

Real working showbiz offices.  No glamour at all.  It looks
more like an insurance agency.

George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone.

		GEORGE
	Sammy, opening for David Brenner is
	a fine gig.  You'll be on the
	road... get some exposure...

O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out.

		SECRETARY (O.S.)
	Tony Clifton on the phone!

		GEORGE
	Who?

		SECRETARY (O.S.)
	He says he's an associate of Andy
	Kaufman's.

		GEORGE
	Oh.
		(back to the phone)
	Sammy, think about it.  I gotta go.
		(he punches a line)
	Hello?  George Shapiro here.

On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares.

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?

		GEORGE
		(beat)
	Er, yes.  Speaking.

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking,
	creaking... Freaking!

George is baffled.

		GEORGE
	Can I help you with something?

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy
	Kaufman, if you know what's good for
	you!

		GEORGE
		(stunned)
	Who is this?
		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	You -- you know damn straight who it
	is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to
	respect.  A name to fear.
		(beat)
	Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.

		GEORGE
	Look... I don't know what your
	problem is...

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you
	sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!

CLICK.  Clifton hangs up.  George is bewildered.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY

The light is magical.  Soothing SITAR music plays.  Andy and
fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi-
circle.  Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they
are all meditating.

Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian
YOGI.  At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a
teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice.

		LITTLE WENDY
	Now, while continuing your deep
	breathing, slowly open your eyes.
	You should feel rested, relaxed, and
	alert.

The students all open their eyes.

		YOGI
	Do any thoughts come...?

		STUDENT #1
	My mind is clear.  I feel great.

		YOGI
	Good...

		STUDENT #2
	All the tension is gone from my
	body.

The Yogi's eyes go to Andy.  Andy smiles sweetly.

		ANDY
	I want to thank you, your Holiness.
	My heart is radiating with pure
	energy.

The Yogi nods kindly.

		YOGI
	You always had a good heart.  But
	I'm proud of the progress you've
	made in your discipline.
		  ANDY
	Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact,
	my manager got me a TV gig!  It's
	just some new show with no budget,
	but I'm still excited.

Oh.  The Yogi peers intently.

		YOGI
	Are you at peace with your family?

		ANDY
	Um, yes.  I haven't fought with
	them, since I started here.

		YOGI
	Goals are important.

		ANDY
	I stopped drinking.  I gave up
	drugs.  And I'm meditating three
	hours a day.  It's the center of my
	life...

		YOGI
	We are all impressed.

Andy smiles beatifically.  This means a lot.

		LITTLE WENDY
	Okay.  Anyone else --?

		ANDY
	Oh, wait!  I have a question.
		(beat; working up
		his nerve)
	Is there... is there a secret to
	being funny?

Huh?  The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face.
Then... he finally speaks.

		YOGI
	Yes.  Silence.

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

An AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end.
TECHIES tweak lights.  CAMERAMEN get ready.

Sitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY.  Stanley and Janice
are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's.
They're all anxious.

		CAROL
	I still can't believe my brother's
	gonna be on TV...!

		JANICE
	I hope he doesn't get nervous.
		    STANLEY
	What's the difference?  This thing's
	on in the middle of the night -- no
	one's even gonna see it.

The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks.  The
crowd APPLAUDS.  An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up.

		HOST
	Welcome back to Saturday Night Live!
	And now, as a special treat on our
	first show... musical guest ANDY
	KAUFMAN!!!

The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song.  Andy enters
the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of
the microphone.  When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy
doesn't open his mouth.  Instead he looks around --
frightened.  The band stops... and starts again.  Andy
remains mute.  The Band stops again.

INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT

The SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	What's happening to him?

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it
loudly.  The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" plays -- but Andy
just blankly stands there.

He's purposefully doing nothing.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)
	"Although we are in danger,
	 We never despair,
	 Because we know where there is
	danger
	 He is there!"

The audience is puzzled.  The Kaufmans are alarmed.

INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT

Lorne Michaels is panicked.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	Oh my God, he's doing nothing.  It's
	dead air...!

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

BACK ON ANDY.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)
	"We're not worrying at all.
	 We're just listening for his
	call..."
Then SUDDENLY -- Andy comes to life and triumphantly LIP
SYNCS.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)
	"Here I come to save the day!"

Shocked, the crowd HOWLS with LAUGHTER.

Then instantly -- Andy resumes his blank expression.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)
	"That means that Mighty Mouse is on
	the way!"

The audience SCREAMS with glee.  The tune ENDS, and the
audience APPLAUDS CRAZILY.

Delighted, Andy grins and bows.

The Kaufmans clap the hardest.  Stanley locks eyes with
Andy... and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George jumps from his desk.  Andy is walking in.

		GEORGE
	Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin'
	out here!!

		ANDY
	The stewardess let me keep my
	headphones.

		GEORGE
	That's... terrific!  But I got
	something better.  This is BIG...
		(giddy; milking the
		moment)
	You are getting a once-in-a-
	lifetime, unbelievably lucrative
	opportunity to star on... a
	PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!

Andy's smile drops.  He freezes up.

		ANDY
	Sitcom...?

		GEORGE
	And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the
	guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore
	and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes
	place in a taxi stand!  And you're
	gonna be the Fonzie!

		ANDY
		(confused)
	I'm -- Fonzie?
		     GEORGE
	NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout
	character!  The guy that all the
	kids impersonate and put on their
	lunchboxes!

		ANDY
		(soft)
	George, I hate sitcoms.

		GEORGE
	HANG ON, you ain't heard the best
	part!  ABC has seen your foreign man
	character, and they want to turn him
	into --
		(he checks his
		notes)
	"Latka," a lovable, goofy
	mechanic!!!

Long pause.  Then -- Andy responds.

		ANDY
	No.

		GEORGE
	"No"?  "No" to which part??

		ANDY
	No to the whole thing.  None of it
	sounds good.

George is flummoxed.

		GEORGE
	Andy... this is every comedian's
	dream.

		ANDY
	I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And
	sitcoms are the lowest form of
	entertainment: Stupid jokes and
	canned laughter.

		GEORGE
		(shocked)
	B-but, this is classy... they did
	Bob Newha--

		ANDY
	I'm not interested.  I want to
	create my own material.

Beat.  George glares.

		GEORGE
	You have to do it.

		ANDY
	I refuse.

		   GEORGE
		(he explodes)
	LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've
	been in this business for twenty
	years!  I know!  If you walk away
	from this opportunity, you will
	never, NEVER see another one like it
	again!!!!

Long pause.  Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion.

Then Andy gets up and looks around the office.  He stares at
the awards... the gold records... emblems of success and
experience.

Andy thinks -- then nods.

		ANDY
	Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.
		(beat)
	But I have a few terms.

		GEORGE
		(relieved)
	Of course!  That's what negotiations
	are for.

Andy starts to write on a piece of paper.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	What are you doing?

		ANDY
	Writing down my terms.

George watches patiently.

Andy clicks his pen, done.  George smiles and takes the
list.  He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled.

		GEORGE
	Are you makin' fun of me --?  This
	is RIDICULOUS!

		ANDY
		(blasй)
	Those are my terms.

		GEORGE
	They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!
		(he points at one
		item)
	I mean -- "two guaranteed guest
	shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is
	this TONY CLIFTON?!

		ANDY
	He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to
	do impressions of him.  We sorta...
	got in a fight over that.

George gets a look.

		GEORGE
	This Clifton called me up.  He's a
	loon!  He HATES you!
		     ANDY
	Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe
	him one.

Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	If I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just
	gonna have to give me what I want.
		(a sarcastic FONZIE
		IMPRESSION)
	Heyyyyyy!

George winces.  He stares at the list.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

George sits across a conference table from three NETWORK
SUITS.  He stoically reads the men his demands.

		GEORGE
	Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half
	the episodes.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed
	90 minutes of meditation prior to
	filming.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman gets his own network
	Special.

The execs are stupefied.  Finally -- George delivers the
clincher.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	And Taxi must guarantee two guest
	appearances to... Tony Clifton.

		NETWORK GUYS
	WHO???

		GEORGE
	Tony Clifton.

		NETWORK GUY #1
	Who is he?!

		GEORGE
		(solemn)
	I don't know.

Long pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his
mind.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	But Andy says he's fabulous.
		(awkward)
	He also says, these are the terms.

The execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly.

		    NETWORK GUY #2
	Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money,
	like everyone else?

George slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No.

Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns.

		MAYNARD (cont'd)
	George, we don't book phantom
	performers.  The deal's off.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

GEORGE throws his attachй case on the desk, then slumps into
his chair.  He picks up the phone and dials.

		GEORGE
	Andy?

		ANDY (O.S.)
	Hi George!

		GEORGE
	Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony
	Clifton... is he performing
	anywhere?

		ANDY (O.S.)
	Of course.
		(beat)
	But only on Monday nights.

		GEORGE
	That's alright.  Where...?

INT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT

Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise
guys, and cigarette smoke.

The Maitre'd guides George to a booth.  A small BAND fills
the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room.

The lights dim.  A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And now, Mama Roma's is proud to
	present International Singing
	Sensation... a man who has sold more
	records than Elvis and the Beatles
	combined...

George is skeptical.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
	Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr.
	Entertainment... TONY CLIFTON!

The DRUMMER starts a drum roll.  Patrons APPLAUD.  A LIGHT
SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters.  The spot
is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum
roll slows down and stops.  The announcer BOOMS again.
		     ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
	Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect
	for Mr. Clifton's vocal demands,
	could everyone please extinguish
	your cigarettes and cigars.

The crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies.  One
ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass.

		ANGRY GUY
	Goddamn, I paid five dollars for
	this.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And now!  A man who needs no
	introduction... TONY CLIFTON!

The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE".  And then,
obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out.  Tony has a rubbery
face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly,
and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping.

Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a
cigarette.  He blows smoke rings at them.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'?

The crowd is furious.

		ANGRY GUY
	Fuck you!

People light back up and start talking.  Tony ignores the
ruckus.  He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key.

		TONY CLIFTON
		(singing)
	"Volare!
	 Whoa, whoa.
	 Cantare,
	 Whoa whoa whoa whoa."

George winces.  He's horrible.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
		(singing)
	"I got the wings of your love,
	 I got the wings of a dove.
	 I got the... uh...
		(forgetting the
		words)
	 ... the chicken wings from
	 Eh, Kentucky Fried..."

The band is lost.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	 Oh.  Whoop do doo,
	 Whoop de di,
	 Stick a needle in your eye...

The band gives up and stops.
		    TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Eh, the hell with that song.

One person CLAPS.  Most BOO.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	So how ya doin'!
		(leering)
	How ya doin' over here?  How ya
	doin' over there?
		(he approaches a
		WOMAN)
	How's that pasta carbonara?

		WOMAN
	Leave me alone.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Okay!
		(he spins around)
	So, you havin' a good time, sir?!

Tony approaches a LONELY SAD SACK sitting at the bar.  Tony
thrusts his mike at the guy.

		SAD SACK
	Sure...

		TONY CLIFTON
	What's your name?

		SAD SACK
	Bob.

		TONY CLIFTON
		(he reacts as if
		this is enormously
		funny)
	"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.
		(beat)
	Bob what?

		SAD SACK
	Bob Gorsky.

		TONY CLIFTON
	"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?

		SAD SACK
		(meek)
	Yes.

Tony gets indignant.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Are you tryin' to do some of that
	Polack humor?  Well if that's so,
	you can just get the hell out of
	this restaurant!

		SAD SACK
		(timid)
	It's my name.

		TONY CLIFTON
	SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!

People are embarrassed.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	I do a clean show!  Like, I wouldn't
	do that one... oh, you know it...
	"What do you call a pretty girl in
	Poland"?

		SAD SACK
		(he giggles
		stupidly)
	A -- a tourist.

		TONY CLIFTON
	See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin'
	about!
		(enraged)
	Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!

Tony snatches Bob's water glass and POURS IT over his head!

George is appalled.  The crowd is aghast.  Bob is wet.
People BOO AND HURL THINGS.

Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the
building.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	And stay out, Fatso!

The room erupts, outraged.  George covers his face, looking
ill.  Suddenly, Tony snaps at him.

		ANDY
	And YOU.  I wanna see you backstage!

George is rattled.

INT. MAMA ROMA'S, KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

The kitchen staff is working.  George wanders around... then
finally spots Tony, back to us, eating pasta at the
employees' table.  Aggravated, George aggressively steps up.

		GEORGE
	Alright, I'm here.  What do you
	want?

Tony puts down his fork.  He pauses... slowly turns
around... and is Andy.

George GASPS.  His eyes bulge.

Andy smiles innocently.  He gestures to an empty seat.

		ANDY
	Are you hungry?

George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a
heart attack.  His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a
chair and sits.  George glances down.  Lying alongside the
food is Tony's rubber face.

		GEORGE
	I... I-I don't understand this act.
		   ANDY
		(in jolly spirits)
	It's good old-fashioned
	entertainment.  Everyone loves a
	villain.

		GEORGE
	Yeah?  Well tell that to the poor
	schlub who you humiliated!

Beat -- then Bob strolls over.  His real name is BOB ZMUDA.

		ZMUDA
	Hey Andy, good show.

		ANDY
	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob
	and I have been buddies for years.

George gapes.  On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof,
and conniving.  He and Andy grin naughtily at each other.

		ZMUDA
	That was a really hot house!

		GEORGE
	So your name's not Gorsky.

		ZMUDA
	Don't believe everything you hear.

George thinks about this -- then laughs.

					  CUT TO:

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

Maynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized.
George is confidentially whispering to them.

		GEORGE
	This has to stay in the room... but
	here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And
	Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up
	and down, but I swear to God,
	they're the same person!
		(with urgency)
	It's smart business!  You'll get two
	Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!

Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and
then he cracks a smile...

INT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

1 a.m. in the supermarket.  Just a few people linger...
including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame.  Andy
stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers
hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians.  Andy is
oblivious to all around him.

In the b.g., George suddenly enters.  He looks around the
market, then spots Andy.  He feverishly runs up.
		   GEORGE
	Andy!

		ANDY
		(still playing the
		game)
	What's up?

George grins crazily, ecstatically.

		GEORGE
	Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed
	to it all!  They thought your terms
	were a shining example of your
	"irreverent wit" -- and precisely
	why they want you!
		(beat)
	You're getting EVERYTHING!

Whoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station
EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and
slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely.

		ANDY
	Well thank you very much...!

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET - DAY

The first week of "TAXI."  The CAST rehearses on the Taxi
set.  PRODUCERS watch from the bleachers.

(The actual TAXI scene will be determined.)  JUDD HIRSCH,
TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines.

Then... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line.

The cast glances around.  Tony Danza loses his temper.

		TONY DANZA
	Man, this is bullshit!
		(he marches up to
		the PRODUCER)
	Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he
	here??

One producer stands.  This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER.

		ED
	You'll see him on Friday when we
	shoot.  Now run the lines with
	Rodney.

An angry beat.  The actors resume...

INT. TAXI SET - DAYS LATER

The AUDIENCE is filtering in.  They fill the studio
bleachers.

INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

Actors mingle outside the dressing rooms.

		     JUDD HIRSCH
	I'm taking bets we do the show with
	the stand-in.

		MARILU HENNER
	No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is
	he's locked inside his dressing
	room.

Judd is surprised.

INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Andy is meditating.  He's tranquil, at total inner peace.

Silence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS.

Andy snaps his eyes open.  He exhales a few calm breaths,
then sits upright.  Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips
it open, and removes a SCRIPT.

Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages
like a speedreader.

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

Bleachers are full.  They're now filming TAXI (the same
scene as earlier).  On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide-
eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls.

Andy is hilarious.  The crowd HOWLS with laughter.

MONTAGE - TAXI

In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments.
He's beloved.  The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER...

INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

TAXI curtain calls.  The whole cast takes bows, then runs
offstage.  Everyone is grinning -- except Andy.

He soberly strolls up to Zmuda.

		ANDY
	I'm gonna quit.

		ZMUDA
	What?!?

		ANDY
	Each show is worse than the next.

		ZMUDA
	Are you nuts?!  40 million people
	watch you every week!

		ANDY
	So?  What do they know?

		ZMUDA
	Absolutely nothing!  That's the
	beauty!
		(he lowers his
		voice)
	It's credibility.  You make them
	love you... and then later, on your
	special, you'll screw with their
	heads!

Hmm?!  Andy raises an eyebrow.
					 CUT TO:

INT. MAYNARD SMITH'S OFFICE - LA - DAY

The power office of Maynard Smith, the powerful ABC exec.
He shouts into a phone.

		MAYNARD
	I don't care!  Travolta signed a
	contract, he's a Sweathog for
	life!... Oh yeah?  Just try to sue
	us.

He HANGS up.  His ASSISTANT peeks her head in.

		ASSISTANT
	Sir, they're having a problem down
	on the Kaufman Special.  They say
	he's not following the... technical
	requirements.

Maynard is baffled.

		MAYNARD
	"Technical"???

INT. "KAUFMAN SPECIAL" SET, TECH BOOTH - SAME TIME

Andy is in a booth, arguing with a HEAVYSET TECHNICIAN.
Zmuda watches and eats a banana.

		ANDY
	It's my show!  Now make it roll!

		TECHNICIAN
	NO!

Maynard strolls up, buttoning his suit jacket, irritated as
he walks around Little Wendy meditating in front of a ring
of candles.

		MAYNARD
	Andy, I hear fabulous things about
	the Special...
		(a delicate pause)
	Eh, I understand we've hit a teeny
	speedbump?

		TECHNICIAN
		(harried)
	Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess
	with the horizontal hold!  He wants
	the picture to roll!

Maynard doesn't exactly understand.

		MAYNARD
	Show me.

The technician pushes a button.  ON THE MONITOR - Andy's
image briefly appears.

			  ANDY (ON-SCREEN)
	And now... in her television debut,
	the incredible Chubby Rosalie!!

At that moment, Andy's image starts rolling across the
screen, until it disappears into a blur of static...

		ANDY
		(happy)
	It'll be great.  The viewer will
	think their TV is broken.  They'll
	get out of their chair, they'll
	twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV,
	but they won't be able to fix it!

Maynard stares at the monitor.  The totally indecipherable
picture still rolls.  A glum pause.

		MAYNARD
	Andy... we don't want the viewer to
	get out of their chair.  They might
	change the channel.

		ANDY
	But it's funny!  It's a practical
	joke.  They'll get frustrated!

Andy beams giddily.  Maynard gazes dully, struggling to
reason.

		MAYNARD
	Andy... uhh... this network has a
	long-standing policy: The viewer
	must be able to see the program.

		ANDY
	But it's only for thirty seconds!

Beat.

		MAYNARD
	Five.

		ANDY
	Twenty!

		MAYNARD
	Ten.

		ANDY
	Deal.

Both men quickly extend their hands and shake.  Maynard nods
and leaves.

Beat.  Then, Andy pulls out a Handi-wipe and cleans his
palm.

A STUDIO PAGE walks over.  He has a huge MAIL BAG.

		STUDIO PAGE
	Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?

Andy looks up -- and his face lights up like Christmas.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap
furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the
Maharishi.  Andy lies on his bed, which is covered with
THOUSANDS OF LETTERS.  He happily chats on the phone.

		ANDY
	... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!...
	Really! ...I got your fan letter...
	So you like the show?  Your letter
	said I was silly.  Did you think I
	was too silly?... Oh good.  I'm
	glad.

Andy holds a letter which has a GIRL'S SNAPSHOT stapled to
it.  He is very nervous.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	It was real nice of you to send your
	picture, Mimi... 'Cause you knew
	what I looked like... and now, I
	know what you look like!

Andy flips the letter over.  He glances at the return
address.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	So, um... San Bernardino...
		(beat)
	That's just a couple hours away,
	isn't it...?

EXT. SAN BERNARDINO, DOWNTOWN - DUSK

The sun is setting.  In an ugly shopping district, Andy
walks along with sexy, wholesome MIMI.

		MIMI
	... so after I finish junior
	college, I'll go to work for my
	dad's accounting firm.  Unless, I
	decide to live with my friend
	Valerie, but she wants to move to
	Anaheim, and I don't want to do
	that.

A disinterested beat.

		ANDY
	Oh.

Another beat.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	So do you wanna wrestle?

		MIMI
	Excuse me -- ?

ANDY
	Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good
	way of breaking the ice.
		(pause)
	That instant physical intimacy
	really brings two people together.

Mimi is bewildered, and offended.

		MIMI
	What are you talking about?!  We
	just met an hour ago.

		ANDY
		(calm)
	No no no, it's not sex!  I mean --
	it can lead to sex... but really,
	it's just wrestling.

		MIMI
	I don't wanna talk about it!

An awkward silence.  They continue walking.  She points up.

		MIMI (cont'd)
	The sunset is really beautiful.

		ANDY
	What do you mean?

		MIMI
		(a bit offput)
	I mean -- uh -- the colors in the
	sky are so vibrant.  I love this
	time of day.

		ANDY
		(he shrugs dully)
	I've never understood that.  It's
	just... getting dark.
		(pause)
	But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we
	fill the car with gas, drive to
	Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???

ANGLE - MIMI

Fear.  She shivers, then hoarsely speaks.

		MIMI
	I think I wanna go home.

					  CUT TO:

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

George screens Andy's TV Special for Maynard and his team.
The network execs look constipated.

ON THE TV - Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody.
		ANDY (ON TV)
	You know... I was once in your
	gallery.  I was just sitting there
	and I wanted to touch you.  I was
	kind of depressed because I could
	see what everyone was like, and I
	was wondering if, now, maybe I
	could... touch you.

Very gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping.

THE EXECS -- are horrified.

	ANDY (ON TV)
	(cont'd)
Howdy, I've been
watching you ever
since I was a little
boy...
    (choked up,
    nervous)
You're the first
friend from television
I ever had.  I always
wanted to meet you...
and now ...I finally
am.

				     EXEC #2
			 This is NOT funny.

				     EXEC #3
				(ominous)
			 "Artsy Fartsy shit"...

				     GEORGE
				(worried at this
				response)
			 No... eh, the Special
			 isn't all like this...
			 just wait... it will be
			 hysterical.

At that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW.  Maynard
scowls.

		MAYNARD
	Christ!  We're the Number One
	Network -- can't we afford decent
	TVs?!

Maynard angrily jumps and POUNDS on the TV.  BANG, BANG!
George winces -- then mutters awkwardly.

		GEORGE
	No, um... it's part of the snow.

An awful beat.

Maynard is embarrassed.  Finally -- he explodes.

MAYNARD
	Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this
	program!!

INT. JERRY'S DELI - NIGHT

A delicatessen.  Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans
tables.  He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food.  Two
BLUE COLLAR GUYS gesture from a booth.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 1
	Excuse me, could I please have more
	coffee?

		ANDY
	Yeah, yeah, in a sec'.
		(he lugs the dishes
		to the kitchen)
	That was decaf, right?

The guy nods.  Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and
starts pouring.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 1
	You know, you look just like Andy
	Kaufman.

		ANDY
	Yeah, I get that all the time.

Andy hurries off.  The guy's buddy leans in, whispering.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 2
	I'm telling you, it's him.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 1
	You wanna bet??  If that was him, he
	wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my
	coffee!

NEAR THE KITCHEN

Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds.  He is sweating.  In the
b.g., George enters the restaurant.  He sees Andy, sits at a
table and YELLS OUT.

		GEORGE
	Hey!  Could you clear this table and
	bring me a piece of poundcake?

Andy turns.  They stare down each other.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Andy, this is ridiculous.  Take off
	that apron.

		ANDY
		(infuriated)
	NO!  I'd rather work here, than at
	ABC.  There's no lying in a
	restaurant.  They don't promise you
	a job as a cashier, then suddenly
	make you a frycook!

Andy hurries off with a water pitcher.  George chases him.
		GEORGE
	Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes!
	But we work in a creative business.
	You can't predict what people are
	gonna like --

		ANDY
	The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I
	could have my own Special!

		GEORGE
		(trying to calm him)
	Tell you what.  I'll book you on
	some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll
	show the Special around... see if
	somebody wants to buy it --

		ANDY
		(bitter)
	Yeah, we can have a garage sale.
	"Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a
	network TV Special for only fifty
	cents!"

A glum moment.

Andy fills water glasses.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	How long is left on my Taxi
	contract?

		GEORGE
	You signed for five years --
		(awkward)
	So four years, seven months.

		ANDY
		(he looks up)
	Okay... I'll go back.  But just let
	them know, first they ain't gettin'
	Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!

EXT. TEXAS A&M COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A marquee says "TEXAS A&M PRESENTS - ANDY KAUFMAN"

Inside, a ROAR of APPLAUSE surges.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - SAME TIME

Andy is walking onstage.  The excited CLAPPING swells.  He's
a gigantic presence to these people.

Andy smiles and bows.

		ANDY
	Thank you.  It's great to be here.
	We're going to have a very nice
	time.  We'll sing some songs --
				SORORITY GIRL
	DO LATKA!!

Andy reacts, perturbed.  He struggles to stay composed.

		ANDY
	Uh, we'll play with puppets --

		DRUNKS IN UNISON
	LATKA!  LATTTTKAAAA!!!

Andy scowls.  Then -- he loses it.

		ANDY
	Excuse me one moment.

Andy angrily hurries offstage.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Zmuda is with the congas and props.  Andy runs up.

		ANDY
	Give me the book.

		ZMUDA
		(startled)
	No!  Andy, don't do it --

		ANDY
	They're asking for it.

Andy fiercely GRABS a small book from Zmuda.  Zmuda cringes.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Andy strides back out.  He gazes at the crowd.

		ANDY
	Since you're such a special
	audience... I'm going to reveal, for
	the first time ever, the real me.
		(he goes into a
		CLIPPED BRITISH
		ACCENT)
	I'm actually British.  I was raised
	in London and educated at Oxford.
	And though I dabble in clowning, I
	do find it so boorish.  So...
	American.
		(beat)
	I prefer the fine arts.  Henceforth,
	tonight,  I'd like to grace you with
	a reading of the greatest novel ever
	written!
		(he holds up the
		book)
	"The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott
	Fitzgerald!!

BEAT.

Heh?  The crowd isn't quite clear if this is good or bad.  A
confused murmur.
		     ANDY (BRITISH)
		(he cracks open the
		book)
	Chapter One.
		(he starts READING)
	"In my younger and more vulnerable
	years, my father gave me some advice
	that I've been turning over in my
	mind ever since.  'Whenever you feel
	like criticizing anyone,' he told
	me, 'just remember that all the
	people in this world haven't had the
	advantages you've had.'"

There's a little NERVOUS LAUGHTER.  Is he really gonna read
this?

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	"He didn't say any more, but we've
	always been unusually communicative
	in a reserved way, and I understood
	that he meant a great deal more than
	that..."

Suddenly, somebody from the audience screams:

		FRAT BOY IN AUDIENCE
	LATKA!!!

The audience ROARS approvingly.  Andy stops reading and
looks at the student.  He smiles.

		ANDY (AS LATKA)
	Tank you veddy much!!!!

The audience APPLAUDS enthusiastically.  Andy waits until
the applause dies and goes back to the book.

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	"When I came back from the East last
	autumn, I felt that I wanted the
	world to be in uniform and at a sort
	of moral attention forever; I wanted
	no more riotous excursions with
	privileged glimpses into the human
	heart..."

People start BOOING.  Andy looks up.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	Please, let's keep it down.  We have
	a long way to go.
		(he resumes reading)
	"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
	name to this book, was exempt from
	my reaction - Gatsby, who
	represented everything for which I
	have an unaffected scorn..."

The crowd is incredulous.
INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	Chapter Two.

The crowd is horribly bored.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The clock says 11:30.  The PROMOTER glares at Zmuda.

		PROMOTER
	Is he ever going to stop?

		ZMUDA
		(dour)
	Sure.  When he reaches "The End."

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

People are streaming out.  Maybe fifty are left.  Andy
realizes this -- but is committed.  He must continue.

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	"Tom was evidently perturbed at
	Daisy's running around alone, for on
	the following Saturday night he came
	with her to Gatsby's party.  Perhaps
	his presence gave the evening its
	peculiar quality of
	oppressiveness..."

A weak VOICE feebly shouts:

		WEAK VOICE
	Do Latka.

Andy looks up, shocked.  Insulted, he "blows his temper."

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	Look!  I don't have to tolerate this
	impoliteness!  Forget it -- I'm
	gonna stop the show.  GOODBYE!

He slams the book shut.  People CHEER.  Andy starts to storm
off -- then turns.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	No, no, I'm only fooling.

The audience GROANS.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	I'll tell you what.  Would you
	rather have me continue reading or
	would you like to hear the
	phonograph record?

The audience ROARS for the record.  Andy smiles, puts the
needle on and to everyone's horror more "Gatsby" comes out.
		ANDY (BRITISH-FROM THE RECORD)
	"His presence gave the evening its
	peculiar quality of oppressiveness -
	it stands out in my memory from
	Gatsby's other parties that
	summer..."

				      DISSOLVE TO:

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

There are six people left in the audience.  Andy reads on.

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	"Tomorrow we will run faster,
	stretch out our arms farther... And
	one fine morning - So we beat on,
	boats against the current borne back
	ceaselessly into the past."

Andy somberly shuts the book.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	The End.

A moment of quiet personal euphoria.  Andy looks enraptured,
the man who has just climbed Everest.

A pause -- but no applause.  It's dead silence.  Andy looks
out... and realizes the few audience members are asleep.

Andy shrugs, then shuffles off-stage.

In the wings, Zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair.

EXT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - DAWN

Andy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily.  They
drag the suitcase containing the props.  They walk slowly
towards their rental car, the campus totally deserted.

		ZMUDA
	Nobody likes anarchy more than me...
	but this is science fiction!

Andy nods uncomprehendingly.

		ANDY
	Let's get some breakfast.

					  CUT TO:

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George is yelling at Andy and Zmuda.  They are seated on his
couch, heads bowed in shame.

		   GEORGE
	What kind of show was this??!
		(angrily reading off
		a LIST)
	There were three-hundred walkouts!
	The promoter wants a refund!

Andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper.

		ANDY
	I'm sorry, George...

		GEORGE
	You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!
		(turning on Zmuda)
	And you -- you're the road manager!
	You should be watchin' out for him!

		ZMUDA
		(a guilty sigh)
	We might have lost our focus...

George paces furiously.

		GEORGE
	When you play the Midwest and South,
	you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE!
	It's not postmodern -- it's rude.
		(beat)
	If you wanna perform in Texas, you
	give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em
	Elvis!!

		ANDY
	But George, I like to push the
	boundaries...

		GEORGE
	And that's great.  But do it in LA
	and New York!  There you experiment!
	Show up with a sleeping bag and take
	a nap on stage!  I don't care!

Hmm.  Andy thinks.

		ANDY
	How long would they let me sleep?

		GEORGE
	I don't know!
		(he composes himself
		and lowers his voice
		to a hush)
	Andy... you need to look inside: Who
	are you trying to entertain?  The
	audience... or yourself?

ANGLE - ANDY

He doesn't know the answer.

					  CUT TO:

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST, BATHROOM - DAY

Andy is manically washing his hands.  Using liquid soap from
the dispenser, then rubbing his hands under the water.  Then
more liquid soap.  More rubbing.  Then more liquid soap...

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George sighs at Zmuda.

		GEORGE
	I'm worried about Andy.  His stress
	level is affecting his work.

		ZMUDA
		(he thinks)
	Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi
	soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.

		GEORGE
	Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if
	you can get him away from all this.
	Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find
	something special.  Something
	nice...

Zmuda mulls this over.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. MUSTANG RANCH, NEVADA - DAY

A tattered sign says "Welcome to the MUSTANG RANCH."  The
world-famous whorehouse sits behind a barb-wire fence.
Dusty connected trailers sit in the sand.

A CAR idles out front.  Zmuda and a scared Andy sit inside.

		ANDY
	I dunno about this...
		(worried)
	What will my mother think?

		ZMUDA
	She'll say, "Now my son is a man."

		ANDY
	It's so dirty.

		ZMUDA
	Nah.  The girls sponge off between
	johns.

Andy nods.

		ANDY
	Okay.

INT. MUSTANG RANCH - DAY

The reception room -- wood paneling and black-lite posters.
Music is playing.  Twenty deadpan HOOKERS are lined up.
Andy, nervous as a high school kid, points at one... then
another... then the first...
		ZMUDA
	Which one?

Beat -- then Andy becomes GERMAN, with a monocle and stiff
walk.

		ANDY (GERMAN)
	I vill haf both!  I vill haf dat
	fraulein... unt... the vun vith the
	big strudels!

The two chosen girls take Andy's hands and lead him off.  He
reaches the door -- then gives Zmuda a nervous look.  Zmuda
smiles reassuringly.  Andy gulps, and goes in...

Beat.  Zmuda turns to the older, jaded MADAM.

		ZMUDA
	This is a big day.  It's my friend's
	first time with a prostitute.

		MADAM
		(mocking)
	What're you talking about?  Andy
	comes here almost every weekend.

Zmuda's jaw drops, stupefied.

		ZMUDA
	You're talking about... Andy?

		MADAM
	Oh, he doesn't always call himself
	that.  Sometimes he's Tony, and
	wears a tux.

Disbelief -- then Zmuda LAUGHS sharply.  He's been conned.

INT. MUSTANG RANCH, BEDROOM - DAY

Andy and the two hookers are WRESTLING.  They grapple and
roll around, all three of them in their underwear.

Suddenly Andy flips the girls over and pins them with his
arms.

Breathing hard, he stares down.

		ANDY
	You let me win.

		HOOKER
		(she giggles sexily)
	What if we did...?!

Andy grins and leans down...

		ANDY
	Hey.  If I give you three-hundred
	dollars, will you come to LA and
	help me destroy a TV show?

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET, REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

The Taxi cast sits irritably around a big table, holding
scripts.  Ed Weinberger enters.

		TONY DANZA
	Where is he?

		ED
	He just arrived.

		CAROL KANE
	He's an hour late.

		ED
	Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a
	little eccentric.  You're all just
	gonna have to roll with the punches
	this week.

Suddenly -- the door SLAMS open.  Tony bounds in, filthy
drunk, clutching a bottle in a brown bag.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Taxi!  Laxy!  Just the factsy,
	Maxie!  Them's all the words that
	rhyme with taxi!... Right, girls?

Little Wendy and the Hooker sashay in, dressed as tarts.
Tony feels them up, and they SQUEAL.  The cast stares in
horror.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Eh, why the blue faces?  You musta
	read the script!
		(he chuckles)
	Well, don't worry!  Your pal Tony
	stayed up all night, writin' some
	fixes on it.
		(he pulls out some
		SCRIBBLED PAGES)
	I added me a musical number, cut out
	Judd Hirsch, and changed the
	location to Mardi Gras!

Ed's expression goes ashen.

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

An attempted rehearsal.  Tony is tap-dancing on top of a car
hood.  He does a "fancy" move, and his booze bottle suddenly
flies away and CRASHES against the wall.

The cast watches, pissed and bored.

		TONY CLIFTON
	And now, the new theme song!
		(he starts SINGING)
	"Oh yes, we drive a taxi,
	 And we're havin' fun.
	 Yeah, we work together,
	 And we get the freakin' job done."

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY

Beleaguered Ed sits with George.

		ED
	George, we've lost two days.
	Filming is on Friday.  We HAVE to
	let him go!

		GEORGE
		(worried)
	I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take
	this...

		ED
	So we'll go downstairs and tell him!

He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set.  George
shakes his head.

		GEORGE
	But that's Tony down there.  That's
	not Andy.  Trust me, it's like
	"Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the
	premises!

Ed glares.

		ED
	Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm
	firing him!

		GEORGE
		(he sighs)
	Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy
	first.  I think he's up in San
	Francisco, doing a concert.

Heh?  Ed raises his eyebrows.

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - SECONDS LATER

George is on the phone.  Ed hovers.

		GEORGE (INTO PHONE)
	Hi, Diane, this is George.  I'm
	trying to reach Andy up in San
	Francisco.
		(a stilted pause)
	Yeah, I'll wait.

Ed glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no
longer there.  He's magically vanished.

Beat.

George turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK!  Andy's happy
voice pops on the line.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!

		GEORGE
	Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up
	there?

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always
	foggy!

Ed looks totally off-balance.  George winks at him.

		GEORGE
	I'm here with Ed over at Taxi.
	There's been some trouble with Tony.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Oh no!  Did he get hurt?

		ED
	No, no, Andy, nothing like that.
		(nervous beat)
	But... Tony's not fitting in.  His
	style of performance is too...
	burlesque.

					INTERCUT:

INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Tony is on the phone.  Little Wendy is busily refilling his
whiskey bottle with canned ice tea.  He looks up, insulted.

		TONY CLIFTON (AS ANDY)
	"Burlesque"?

					 BACK TO:

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY

		ED
	Andy, I'm calling you up like this
	because I have the utmost respect
	for your artistry.  But -- I need
	your permission to fire him.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Oh dear!
		(upset)
	George, this is gonna kill Tony.
	He's waited his whole life for this
	break.

		GEORGE
	There'll be other shots.

		ED
	Andy, I have to do it.  He's a
	terrible actor.

Andy thinks about this.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	I guess I understand.  But Ed --
	please... let him down gentle.

		ED
	Yes, Andy, I will.

Andy hangs up.  A relieved Ed turns to George.

		ED (cont'd)
	Thank you.

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

Tony SCREAMS insanely.

		TONY CLIFTON
	FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!!

WIDE

Ed is stupefied.  The cast stands nervously behind him.

		ED
	We had a deal!!

		TONY CLIFTON
	I don't know what yer talkin' about.
	You musta talked to someone else --

		ED
	Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!

		TONY CLIFTON
	I don't know nothin' about no
	Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my
	coattails, smearing my reputation.
	Been usin' my good name, to get
	places.

Ed is livid.  He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning
eyes piercing through the rubber features.

		ED
	Get off my stage!  You're fired!

		TONY CLIFTON
	I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take
	you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!

Suddenly -- FLASH!  Ed looks over.  A REPORTER has a camera.

		ED
	Who're YOU?!

		REPORTER
	I'm from the LA Times.  We're doing
	a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman arranged it.

UP IN THE BLEACHERS - George enters.  He looks down at the
growing debacle, and winces.  Uh-oh.

ONSTAGE - Enraged, Ed blows up.

		ED
	Security!  Escort this man off the
	lot!!

ONSTAGE - Studio SECURITY GUARDS run over.  They GRAB Tony.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Stop!  GETCHER HANDS OFF ME!

Tony scuffles.  The camera FLASHES.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	LEMME GO!  I'M A BIG STAR!

IN THE BLEACHERS - George stares at this mess... and starts
giggling.

ONSTAGE - Two guards drag Tony to the door.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	You'll be SORRY!  One day I'm gonna
	OWN this town!!

Tony SCREAMS and gets removed.  Dead silence.  Then --

		ED
	I don't want those pictures getting
	out.

		SECURITY GUARD
		(to the reporter)
	This is a closed set.  You'll have
	to give me the film in that camera.

The Guard reaches for the camera.  An uncertain moment...
until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.

		ZMUDA
	I'll take care of this.

Zmuda takes the camera.  He casually starts to make his way
for the exit... when Ed suddenly HOLLERS.

		ED
	Wait -- he's one of THEM!

Zmuda gasps.  Two guards go running for him.

Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape.  The guards chase.
Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera
into George's arms.  The guards whip by, oblivious.

George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties.  He sweatily
peers at the timebomb in his hands.

And then -- George thrusts it under his jacket.  He bolts
for the door and feverishly scampers out.

EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY

George runs for his life.  He knocks aside a rack of
costumes and serpentines between people.

At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Stop!  HELP!  You wouldn't do this
	to Wayne Newton --

The guards toss Tony out the gate.  He lands in a heap.

In the b.g., George crazily flies by.  He gets out the exit.

EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT, OUTSIDE THE GATES - DAY

George doubles over, trying to catch his breath.  He glances
down... and Tony is lying next to him.  Little Wendy and
Zmuda run up, out of breath.

They all look at each other.  There's a moment of
understanding.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Hey.  Good hustlin'.

George slowly smiles.

INT. TAXI OFFICES - SAME TIME

Ed storms in, insanely angry.

		ED
	That asshole!  That FUCKING
	BASTARD!!
		(he SLAMS the door
		behind him)
	We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT
	COCKSUCKER SHAFTED ME!!

Ed is seething.  His SECRETARY timidly speaks.

		SECRETARY
	Um, Ed... you have a phone call --

		ED
	I'M NOT IN!

		SECRETARY
	Well, um... it's Andy Kaufman...

Heh??!  Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone...
then slowly picks it up.

		ED
	Yeah???

A long pause... then Andy's voice calmly speaks.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	You were brilliant.

A flabbergasted beat.

		ED
	Huh?

		ANDY (V.O.)
	You were in the moment.  You became
	a producer losing his mind.
		(sincerely joyful)
	It was the best improv I've ever
	seen.

TIGHT - ED

He thinks intently about this.  And then... amazingly, a
magnificent smiles comes over his face.

		ED
	Well -- thank you.

Pause.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Okay.  See you next week.

Andy hangs up.  Ed just sits there, astounded.

Andy, Zmuda, George and Little Wendy are squeezed in a

a PHOTO of Tony being thrown off the Taxi set.

They all HOWL.

		ANDY
	This is great!  It makes Tony REAL -
	- three-dimensional!  It's very good
	for his career.

Zmuda reads one paragraph.

		ZMUDA
	"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman?
	And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy
	Kaufman crazy?"

		ANDY

	Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm

Hmm.  A few awkward glances.

George on the phone.

		GEORGE
	Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like

	Oh.

Disappointed beat.  The booker thinks.

		BOOKER (O.S.) (cont'd)
	What about Tony Clifton?

		GEORGE
		(startled)
	Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to
	headline Harrah's Tahoe??

		BOOKER (O.S.)
		(being tricky)
	Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand
	our audience base -- and I know the
	college kids really love Andy
	Kaufman.

George winces.

		GEORGE
	Look -- I gotta be clear with you.
	Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.

		BOOKER (O.S.)
	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!
		(he LAUGHS merrily)
	Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!

		GEORGE
		(frustrated)
	No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony,
	do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.

		BOOKER (O.S.)
		(LAUGHING harder)
	I'll take my chances!!

George rolls his eyes in annoyance.  Finally, he shrugs.

		GEORGE
	Fine, be my guest!  Book him.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

George is driving in his convertible.  Suddenly, something
catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes.  Three
cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each
other.

George is oblivious.  He's staring up at a BILLBOARD.
The BILLBOARD: It says "HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY
KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON!  TOGETHER ON STAGE!  ONE NIGHT
ONLY!"

George is flabbergasted.

George is shouting into a payphone.

	Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're
	not getting BOTH of them!

	It's physically impossible!

	Why's that?  You said over and over

	Kaufman --

		GEORGE
	Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But --
	trust me, it's not gonna happen!

		BOOKER (O.S.)
	Sure it is.  Tony called me himself.
	He yelled at me, insisting that his
	dressing room be bigger than Andy's.
	They're both going on tonight,
	believe me!

George is stupefied.  He looks at his watch.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - DUSK

Magnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline.  The marquee
blares "TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!"  George screeches up
in a rental car.  He jumps out and runs inside.

INT. HARRAH'S SHOWROOM - NIGHT

The showroom is packed.  It hums with curiosity.  WAITERS
clean off the dinner tables.  George rushes in and is seated
in a far booth, with some STRANGERS.  He overhears a heated
conversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE.

		PUSHY MAN
	You're not listenin'!  It's a VERY
	simple concept.

		WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
	You're making no sense.  How can
	they be the same person --?

		PUSHY MAN
	Trust me!  You'll never see them on
	stage at the same time!

The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare.  LIGHTS DIM.  Sharp
SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage.  Suddenly -- Tony
swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph.

Thunderous APPLAUSE.  Tony beams.  The music stops.

George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of
this.

Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra,
and waits.  The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not
entirely.  Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until
suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS
FURIOUSLY.

		TONY CLIFTON
	SHUT UP!!!!!!

Everybody looks up, alarmed.  The general murmur almost
dies.  Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all
the unruly people.  As they quiet down... Tony turns back to
the orchestra and raises his arms.  The MUSICIANS lift their
instruments.  Silence is total -- except for the clank of
china.

Waiters are serving coffee.

Tony spins back around, livid.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	THAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO,
	PENGUINS!!!

People signal "shh"!  The waiters realize Tony's addressing
them, and they stare back in disbelief!  This is their job!

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Yeah!  Yeah!  YOU!  I'm talkin' to
	YOU!!  And you better freeze, or
	I'll get your asses fired!!!

Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze.  The
waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror.

Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his
arms.  Again, the musicians lift their instruments.  In
anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about.
Audience members start whispering.  Tony hears this -- and
drops his arms and head in despair.

The musicians lower their instruments.  Tony waits for
absolute silence.  Only then does he signal the musicians to
get ready again.  They do.  And then at that precise moment
-- somebody DROPS a spoon.
Tony jolts, as if hit by a current.  He drops his hands
again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look.
Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits.  And waits.
And waits.

The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.

		PUSHY MAN
	He's never gonna start!  Kaufman
	thinks this is funny!
		(beat)
	We've paid forty bucks for a show
	that's never gonna start!

George grins stupidly.  The silence is now deafening.
Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms.  Slowly... the
musicians get their instruments ready.  Tony stands there,
and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything...
to disturb the silence.  In vain.  Somebody COUGHS.  The
whole scene repeats itself.

Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence.
Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would
become unbearable), he begins to move.  Tony pivots around,
looks at the audience...

And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Tony
starts LAUGHING hysterically.  The audience's reaction is
mixed:

Some people LAUGH.  Some BOO.  Some ask perplexed questions.
Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES.  Some even APPLAUD.

Tony is very happy.  He turns to the orchestra, raises his
baton -- and commences the downbeat!  The MUSIC BEGINS.

A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT.

George's jaw drops.

		WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
	You see!  I told you!  They're not
	the same person!

The whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  Life is back to
normal.  Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a
prepared row of congas.  He starts to play.

Tony Clifton grabs the microphone.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Thank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this
	tune for my friend Frank Sinatra.
	He had a nice little success with
	it... but forgot to thank me on the
	album.

He starts to BELT "I Gotta Be Me".

George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"Whether I'm right
	 Or whether I'm wrong
	 Whether I find a place in this
	world
	 Or never belong!
	 I gotta be me!  I gotta be me!
	 What else can I be, but what I am?"

Tony's singing is awful.  Andy happily accompanies on
congas.  The audience doesn't know what to think.

Tony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Let's bring it on home --
		(he hits his
		screeching CLIMAX)
	"I GOTTA BE MEEEEEE!"

The BAND ends with a brassy punch.  The crowd responds with
LOUD BOOING.

INT. HARRAH'S, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

George wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms.
He turns and finds a door marked "KAUFMAN".  Next to it is a
door marked "CLIFTON".

George stares.  He thinks, then opens the "KAUFMAN" door.

Andy is inside alone, gathering his things.  He's pleasantly
surprised to see George.

George doesn't enter.  He goes to the "CLIFTON" door.  Andy
follows.  George opens the mystery door...

INT. HARRAH'S, CLIFTON'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

and inside, taking off the rubber Tony makeup, is Zmuda.

George starts hyperventilating.  Shaking, he tries to sit
himself down.  Andy enters, beaming.  George is amazed.

		GEORGE
	You're so proud.  You're like some
	retarded kid comin' home from
	school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"

		ANDY
	But wasn't it funny?

		GEORGE
	"Funny"?  I dunno.  But
	"intriguing"... "mindboggling"...
	perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.
		(softening)
	Like, that moment, when you both
	came onstage...

Andy excitedly jumps up and down.

		ANDY
	Uh-huh!  See, with all these
	articles, people think they're
	insiders.  They see Tony Clifton,
	and they say, "Ah, that's really
	Andy Kaufman."  But that spoils it.
	So NOW, Tony denying being me is the
	truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he
	is!  The audience will never know...
		(giddy)
	They'll think they're laughin' at me
	-- but actually I'll be laughin' at
	them, because they're wrong and I'm
	right!

George is dazed.

		GEORGE
	So you've got this big elaborate
	joke, which is really only funny to
	two people in the universe.
		(dry)
	You... and you.

		ZMUDA
	Sure!  But WE think it's kickass!
	Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump
	the glass of water on someone else's
	head!

		GEORGE
		(he turns serious)
	But what's the POINT?  How will any
	of this make you the biggest star in
	the world?

Hmm.  Andy contemplates this.

		ANDY
	George... I'm at a stage where the
	audience expects me to constantly
	shock them.  But short of faking my
	death, or setting the theater on
	fire, I don't know what else to do.
		(thoughtful)
	'Cause I've always got to be one
	step ahead of them.

		GEORGE
	But I feel you're extending this
	philosophy to real life.  It's
	obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the
	level anymore.

A perplexed beat.

		ANDY
	George, it never was.
		(pause)
	Didn't you know that?

					  CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder,
on the cover of a magazine.  Magazines are everywhere.  Body-
building.  Women's.  Wrestling.

ANDY is sifting through them.  Zmuda watches, worried.

		ANDY
	Look at this!  An evil Russian!
	Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes
	to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil
	Japanese guy!

		ZMUDA
	What is this, World War Two...?

		ANDY
	You know, I always wanted to be a
	bad-guy wrestler...

		ZMUDA
	No offense, pal, but I just don't
	think you're built for it.  These he-
	men'll kick your ass!!  They're
	huge!

Andy's face drops.  He realizes Zmuda's right.

Beat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a
picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiancйe on the
cover.  He slowly lifts it up, intrigued.

		ANDY
	Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller
	than me...!

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY

CLOSE UP on Andy and Merv Griffin.  Andy wears a goofy
wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear.  He is
shouting like a wrestler.

		ANDY
	... And I vow to continue wrestling
	until I am BEA TEN, in a three-
	minute match, with my shoulders
	pinned to the mat!!

		MERV
		(nonplussed)
	By a woman.

		ANDY
	Yes!  BY A WOMAN!
		(emphatic)
	I'm doing this because I feel that a
	woman cannot beat a man in
	wrestling.  Even if they train with
	weights... it requires a certain
	mental ability --
		(a clumsy pause)
	And, uh -- I just don't feel they
	have that...

The audience MURMURS uncomfortably.  Andy laughs and
backpedals.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	No no!  Women are superior in many
	ways.  When it comes to cooking and
	cleaning, washing the potatoes,
	scrubbing the carrots, raising the
	babies, mopping the floors, they
	have it all over men.  I believe
	that!

An appalled silence.

Merv winces.  Some people start BOOING.  We can tell Andy is
pleased.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	But when it comes to wrestling,
	forget it!  If there's a woman that
	can prove me wrong, come up here.
	I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500
	dollars.

Merv baitingly turns to the crowd.

		MERV
	Any... volunteers...?

WIDE

All the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up!

We move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty
woman, LYNNE.  She mutters, half hateful, half laughing --

		LYNNE
	I wanna kill that jerk.

					  CUT TO:

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - MINUTES LATER

Andy and Lynne stand in the ring.  She scornfully watches
him preen about.  Zmuda is in a referee's uniform.

		ZMUDA (AS REFEREE)
	Will you please shake hands, go to
	your corners, and come out
	wrestling.

Lynne extends her hand.  Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely
refuses and struts away.  The crowd HISSES.

DING!  It's the bell.  The match begins.  Lynne barrels at
him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this
experience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and
flips her over.

WHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this.

Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official.
Lynne struggles and slithers away.

She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER.
His torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he
rolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The
crowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a
stern warning.

Andy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around
the ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins
her into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They
struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One!
Two!  Three!

And DING!  It's OVER.  Andy jumps up and sneers at the
crowd.

		ANDY
	I'm the winner!  I've got the
	BRAINS!
		(he points at his
		head)
	Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get
	back in the kitchen where you
	belong!!!

Lynne glares.

Out of the blue, and old RECORDING OF BOUNCY PIANO MUSIC
starts playing.  A chicken CLUCKS to the music, and Andy lip-
syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the
ring.

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY

Lynne is escorted by a GUEST COORDINATOR.  Lynne is dazed.
The Coordinator hands her a bunch of crap.

		GUEST COORDINATOR
	Here's your complimentary photo with
	Merv.  Here's your Turtle Wax --

		LYNNE
	I don't need Turtle Wax.

		GUEST COORDINATOR
	Every guest of Merv gets it.  And
	here's your dinner-for-two voucher
	at Red Lobster.

Lynne takes her junk and hobbles off.  She passes Andy, who
sees her and grins.

		ANDY
	Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those
	goodies!

		LYNNE
	Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody
	else.

Lynne coldly hurries away.  Andy chases after her.

		ANDY
	Hey, I hope you didn't take that
	stuff I said seriously.  It was just
	part of the show!
		(eager to impress)
	It's like the old days, when a
	carnival barker would try to rile up
	the crowd.

		LYNNE
	Oh.  So you were just pretending to
	be an asshole.

Andy nods, pleased.

		ANDY
	It's what I'm good at!

Lynne stares -- then begrudgingly cracks a smile.

INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY

Jumbo-sized BEEFY MEN work out, sweating and groaning.  In a
corner, Andy lifts huge barbells.  George stares, pained.

		GEORGE
	Merv Griffin has received 2000
	pieces of hate mail.  Andy, Merv
	Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.


		ANDY
	That means it was a success.  I woke
	up the audience -- like punk rock!
		(he hands him a
		BARBELL)
	Here, take this.

		GEORGE
	No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I
	take it I'll break my back.

He crosses his arms.  Andy frowns and lowers the weight.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Buddyboy, they detest you!  Next
	time you make an appearance, women
	are gonna picket.

		ANDY
	They're having a laugh...

		GEORGE
	WRONG!  You haven't given them any
	clues that it's a parody!

		ANDY
	That's because they've only seen it

steps -- Lynne.

	Hi...

	Hi... am I late?

	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

Andy gives Lynne her ticket.  They enter the theater.

Andy hurries up to the candy counter.

		ANDY
	Popcorn?

		LYNNE
	No thanks.

		ANDY
	I really want one.

	One large tub of popcorn, please,
	extra butter.

The CANDY GIRL makes Andy his popcorn.  He pays... then
heads to the exit.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Okay.  Let's go.

Lynne is baffled.

		LYNNE
	Andy, the theater's that way!

		ANDY
	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn...
	but that doesn't mean I have to sit
	through "On Golden Pond."

Lynne stands in place.  Andy smiles.

	C'mon.  We'll go for a walk.

	Fine.

She throws down her ticket and runs after him.

Andy is shocked.

	Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

	I'm here, ain't I?

A charged moment.  Andy's eyes widen.  His speech gets

	Do I wanna go to Memphis and get

	Because Memphis is the wrestling

	come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, MEMPHIS - NIGHT

The arena is filled with furious BOOING SOUTHERN WRESTLING
FANS.  Ladies in hair nets.  Men clutching beer cans.  This
is a rougher crowd than we've seen before.

Andy stands in the ring, unshaven in a torn green robe.
He's screaming at them.

		ANDY
		(screaming)
	SHUT UP!
		(more BOOS)
	SHUT UP!  Show some respect!  I want
	SILENCE when I speak!

People BOOO louder and throw debris.  Andy is pleased.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	If any woman can defeat me, I will
	pay her 1000 dollars!  Then I'll
	shave my head bald!  And then as a
	bonus -- that lucky lady will get to
	marry me!!

Screeching JEERS and CATCALLS.  Down front... Lynne jumps
up.

		LYNNE
	Look here, Andy Kaufman!  I'll take
	you on -- SISSY!

The mob LAUGHS harshly.

		ANDY
	Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well
	I say -- get back in the kitchen!

		LYNNE
		("outraged")
	No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm
	gonna make you dry my dishes!

The crowd APPLAUDS.  Lynne grins and starts to climb in the
ring.  Andy's eyes are ablaze.  But suddenly -- an oversized
Southern MAN jumps in and snatches the mike away.

		MAN
	STOP IT!  This woman's a FAKE!
	She's nothing but Kaufman's
	girlfriend!

Andy and Lynne are startled.

		ANDY
	T-that's not true --

		MAN
	It's a set-up!  And I won't allow
	our great sport to be degraded by a
	fix!!

The crowd angrily starts to HISS.  Lynne whispers to Andy.

		LYNNE
	Andy... who is that...?

		LAWLER
	I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of
	Memphis wrestling!!
		(this gets HUGE
		CHEERS)
	So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've
	brought a real wrestler!  She's
	trained and she's READY!!  Kaufman,
	do you think you can handle... FOXY
	JACKSON???!!!

At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands -- FOXY.

The coliseum SCREAMS with excitement.  People POUND their
seats.  The roar is deafening.  Lawler gleams cockily.
Lynne looks worriedly at Andy -- he's concerned.

					  CUT TO:

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

DING!  The bell rings.  Foxy comes out, ready to brawl.  But
Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock.  He
nonchalantly peels off his robe.  Foxy dances around
impatiently.  Andy casually removes a towel from his neck.
People BOO.  Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch.

People SCREAM so furiously they're red-faced.  Andy is
tormenting them.  A TATTOOED GUY jumps up.

		TATTOOED GUY
	Are you scared???

Andy sneers.  He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over...
and commences a WINDMILL.  Absurdly, he spins his arms
around and around, daring Foxy to get near him.

She rolls her eyes and waits.  The REF jumps out of the way.
A minute has counted down.  Finally, Andy stops -- and the
real wrestling begins.  Foxy lunges at him and immediately
goes for a choke-hold.  The crowd CHEERS, relieved.  Lawler
motions signals.  Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away.

Andy is intrigued.  She's coming to play!  Andy gestures to
the Ref and points UP.  The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS
Foxy.

The crowd furiously JEERS.  The Ref spins around, and Andy
shrugs innocence.  He then runs at Foxy and theatrically
pushes her into the ropes.  She bounces off, stumbles back -
- and Andy drops to his knees.  She trips over him and hits
the mat.

Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her.
The Ref counts:  One!  Two!  Three!  DING!!

It's over.  But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering
rudely.  Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.

		LAWLER
	Alright, you won.  GET OFF HER!

Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken.

THE BOOING grows.  Louder.  More emotional.

		ANGRY VOICES
	Jerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do
	something!

Lawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and
lifts Andy off!  Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down.

Andy is flabbergasted.

		ANDY
	W-what are you DOING?  I don't fight
	men!

Lawler snickers and walks away.  Completely overreacting,
Andy grabs the mike.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'm gonna SUE YOU!
		(he starts RANTING
		berserkly)
	Let me tell you something, Lawler!
	I am not a hick -- I'm a national TV
	star!  And I DON'T like a dumb
	cracker pushing me around in the
	ring!  I never agreed to wrestle
	you!  So you know what I'm gonna
	do???
		(seething)
	I'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you
	for every cent you've got!  This was
	assault and battery!  In a court of
	law, I'm gonna kick your Southern-
	fried rump!!!

Lawler snatches the mike and bellows.

		LAWLER
	YEAH?!  Well I got news for you,
	Andy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a
	serious sport to me!  I don't like
	anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate
	anyone insultin' the South!  So we
	can settle this two ways: We can go
	to court... or you can get in the
	ring with a man, and wrestle for
	REAL!

Andy watches, fuming.  He is INFURIATED.

		ANDY
	He -- can't get away with this.
		(to Lawler)
	YOU!  You think I'm CHICKEN?!

Andy grabs back the mike.  He sticks his face in shocked
Lawler's.

		ANDY (cont'd)
		(sarcastic SOUTHERN
		ACCENT)
	You wanna "wraaastle" me?!  You
	wanna "WRAAASTLE" me???  Okay,
	Lawler -- let's rumble!  Yeah, I've
	only wrestled women, but they were
	bigger than you!  In fact, they're
	probably smarter than you, 'cause
	you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!"
		(back to his regular
		voice, he points at
		his head)
	I'm from Hollywood.  I have the
	brains.  That's how I win.  And Mr.
	Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry
	"Mama!"

Andy bears his teeth.  Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing
at him.  HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men.

EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, TUNNEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

We hear NOISE from the main event above.  Andy and Lynne
hurry along.  She is disgruntled.  He swaggers arrogantly,
still in his fighting outfit.

		LYNNE
	Is this an act -- or are you
	addicted to causing trouble??

		ANDY
		(he jokingly
		impersonates a
		drunk)
	I can shtop whenever I want...

She's unamused.

		LYNNE
	Then stop treating me like a fucking
	prop.

		ANDY
		(he drops the act)
	I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the
	action...!

She shoots him a stern look.

Andy laughs.

	First, you piss-off women.  Then you
	piss-off the South.  Then you get
	killed!
		(dry)
	And I did the bookings.

Andy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Andy, look... there's a job I want
	you to take -- guest-hosting the TV
	show "Fridays."  It's not so hot...
	but this is a great opportunity for
	you.  The show's live, they'll give
	you carte blanche, and you can get
	back to the business of making
	people laugh.

Andy gets a strange gleam.  He only heard one thing.

		ANDY
	You said -- live?

INT. FRIDAYS SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

The FRIDAYS CAST prepares.  In a corner, ANDY is arguing
with director JACK BURNS.

		ANDY
	I'm not comfortable with the last
	sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!

		JACK BURNS
	Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what
	we're known for!
		(playing "stoned")
	"Maui?  "Wowie!"

		ANDY
		(losing his temper)
	You're not listening to me --

		JACK BURNS
	Don't worry!  The kids will love it
	--

		ANDY
		(he BLOWS up)
	But I don't do drugs!  And I don't
	enjoy making light of them!
		(YELLING)
	I was promised creative control!

Andy storms off.  Eavesdropping cast shake their heads.

		ACTOR
	What a prick!

INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

Up in the control booth is -- Maynard.  He smiles strangely.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

Stanley sits in front of his TV.  The Fridays JINGLE and
CREDITS come on.  We hear dishes being washed in the
kitchen.

		STANLEY
	It's on!  JANICE, IT'S ON!

Janice rushes in, still holding some dishes.

(THE FOLLOWING IS INTERCUT: Between the studio and the show
on tv at Andy's parents.)

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

The show is going, live.  A SNIGGERING NARRATOR steps out
front.  (During his monologue, the CAMERA PANS the
audience.)

		NARRATOR
	In this next sketch, two married
	couples are out to dinner.  Now...
	everybody has secretly brought along
	a joint --
		(crowd WHOOPS, he
		grins)
	So, when each person leaves the
	table, they sneak into the restroom
	to get a little high...

The crowd CHEERS rowdily.

					  CUT TO:

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

		JANICE
	I saw Michael!

		STANLEY
	Where?

		JANICE
		(points to the set)
	There!

					  CUT TO:

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

In the front row, Michael sits with a girl.  He whispers.

		MICHAEL
	Afterwards, I'll take you backstage.
	You can meet my brother.

The girl smiles excitedly.

The SKETCH is on a French restaurant set.  ANDY sits at a
table with actor RICHARDS and actress MELANIE.  Another
actress, MARY, tiptoes back over, GIGGLING stupidly, playing
stoned.

		MARY
	"Gee, restaurants are amazing,
	aren't they?  All these strangers
	sitting around... stuffing dead
	animals in their faces!  It's just
	incredible!"

She GIGGLES more.  The other three play baffled.

		MELANIE
	"If you say so."

		ACTOR
	"Excuse me, I'll be right back."

Andy stands and walks out.

					 CUT TO:

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

		JANICE
	Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy
	much to do.

		STANLEY
	He said he's coming back!

					  CUT TO:

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

Actors read the menus.  Suddenly Andy returns, a strange
grin on his face.  He's swaying on his feet.

The audience WHOOPS:  "Yeah!  All right!"

Andy awkwardly sits.  He has a strange hesitancy.

		ANDY
	"Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--"

Suddenly he STOPS.  The actors glance up.

Andy purses his lips, fretting.  An endless pause.

Uh-oh.  Andy won't finish the line.  The cast looks around
worriedly.  Live TV is beaming out... Finally, Melanie
covers.

		MELANIE
	You okay, honey?  Something wrong,
	Carl?

		ANDY
	I can't, um...

Andy shakes his head.

The crowd laughs nervously.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I can't play stoned.

INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

The TECH DIRECTOR and his crew are bewildered.  They flip
through script pages.

		TECH DIRECTOR
	Shit...!  What's he doing??

But Maynard raises a calm hand.

		MAYNARD
	It's okay.  Stay with it.

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

Silence.  Andy is torn up inside.

		RICHARDS
		(whispering to Andy)
	Just read the cue cards!

		ANDY
		(he shakes his head)
	I can't play stoned.  I feel really
	stupid.

More silence.  The actors are trapped and upset.

		MELANIE
	You feel stupid?  What about us?!

The tension is awful.

Unsure beat -- then fed-up Richards jumps up and storms off
the set.  A CAMERAMAN hesitantly pans, confused what to do.

Mary is lost.  She continues giggling, "stoned."

Richards returns... with the CUE CARDS.  Irked, he dumps
them over Andy's head.

The crowd CHEERS stupidly.

		ANDY
	You didn't have to do that!

Andy gets enraged, grabs his prop water glass and THROWS it
in Richard's face.

		RICHARDS
	Hey!  CUT IT OUT!

		MELANIE
	You JERK!

Melanie slaps her prop butter in Andy's hair.

WIDE - Jack runs up from the floor.  He gestures at the
booth.

		JACK BURNS
	Go to commercial, man!
		(he turns to Andy)
	Get off the stage!

		ANDY
	I said I didn't want to do the
	sketch.

		JACK BURNS
		(he JABS him)
	GET OFF!

		ANDY
	DON'T TOUCH ME!

Andy HITS Jack.  Jack recoils and SLUGS him.  They start
FIGHTING.

BURLY CREWMEN run in.  The crowd WHOOOOOS.

Chaos.  Andy swings wildly.  The brawl goes wild.  Actors
duck.  Crewmen struggle to separate Andy and Jack.  Everyone
gets dragged in.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Michael tries to run up and help.  A
SECURITY GUY blocks him.

INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

The tech crew is freaking out.  Maynard is oddly calm.

		TECH DIRECTOR
	Go to three!  Eh, go to four!

					  CUT TO:

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

Stanley and Janice are flabbergasted.  Jaws wide.

On their TV - fists are flying.  Suddenly, the BAND kicks in
and the show abruptly cuts to COMMERCIAL.

They stare at the TV.  Until --

		STANLEY
	I shoulda made him play outdoors.

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

Andy and Jack are socking each other.  A FLOOR DIRECTOR
screams at the top of his lungs.

		FLOOR DIRECTOR
	We've gone to commercial!  I said,
	WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!!

Andy turns.  He notices the red lights are off -- and...
instantly stops fighting.  Just like that.  Jack instantly
stops too.  They glance at each other -- hold a beat -- then
break into GUFFAWS.  They laugh and joyously kid each other.

In the audience, Michael is STUNNED.

		MELANIE
	Oh my God --!

All the commotion stops.  The audience doesn't know whether
to laugh or boo.  The actors are flabbergasted -- then
furious.

		MELANIE (cont'd)
	He's a fuckin' psycho!

		MARY
	Why didn't someone tell us???

Suddenly Maynard runs out of the booth, beaming.  People
watch curiously.

Andy seems discombobulated.  Maynard shouts out to EVERYBODY
assembled.

		MAYNARD
	Excuse me!... I have an announcement
	to make!  You've all just
	participated in a "happening."  To
	make it real, some of you knew, and
	some of you didn't.

The audience LAUGHS and APPLAUDS wildly.  The actors stare
in disbelief.  One laughs hysterically.  Most are pissed.

		MAYNARD (cont'd)
	But we don't want to upset the folks
	at home.  So now Andy is now going
	to apologize and explain that it was
	all a prank.  Right, Andy?

		ANDY
		(very quiet)
	Right...

		MAYNARD
	Okay, great!  So let's reset!

Crew members start moving things around.

In the audience, Michael locks eyes with Andy.  An odd,
knowing moment between the brothers.  Michael whispers,
getting worried.

		MICHAEL
	Andy...!

					  CUT TO:

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

Stanley and Janice feel as if the commercials are lasting
forever.

		JANICE
	Why is Andy doing this?  Why?...
	Why?

The Fridays JINGLE starts, and Andy's face fades in on the
TV.  He looks directly into the camera, nervous, stiff and
serious.

		ANDY (ON TV)
	During the commercial, the people at
	ABC asked me to apologize... and to
	tell you the truth.  They wanted me
	to explain that this whole fighting
	episode was staged...

INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT

The sign above blinks "APPLAUSE".  The audience obediently
APPLAUDS.  In the booth, Maynard grins.

		ANDY
	And... um...
		(choking up)
	I can't do this.
		(beat)
	I-I can't say it.
		(upset)
	It's a lie!  A cover-up!

Maynard is suddenly very confused.  The crowd laughs
nervously.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Why are you laughing?  I'm not
	trying to be funny!  They threatened
	to fire me from Taxi, unless I gave
	in to their demands!
		(shaken)
	But... I won't!  Because what you
	saw was REAL!!

INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

Maynard looks like he's gonna faint.

		MAYNARD
	Cue the commercial!

		ANDY (ON TV)
	These kinds of things go on everyday
	at the networks, only you never see
	it, because they cut to commercials.
		(he talks extremely
		fast, to get in as
		much information
		before he's cut off)
	Now for sure they're gonna fire me,
	so if you want to see me again,
	you'll have to come to Memphis...

And BLINK!  Andy gets CUT OFF.

Maynard jumps up, furious.  He snaps.

		MAYNARD
	I'm gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro!

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME

The parents stare at the commercials.  They're totally
disoriented.

		JANICE
	What's in Memphis?

		STANLEY
	Who knows?!  That kid is totally
	meshuga.

					  CUT TO:

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, MEMPHIS - NIGHT

Memphis wrestling.  The announcer stands center ring,
booming into the mike.

		ANNOUNCER
	And now!  The MAIN EVENT of the
	evening!  The match you've been
	waiting for: The King Jerry Lawler,
	versus Hollywood Andy Kaufman!

The THEME FROM "ROCKY" PLAYS -- and Lawler enters from the
tunnel, wearing a shimmering hero's cape!  The crowd ROARS
with approval.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

Andy is meditating, eyes shut, at rest in his private oasis.
Suddenly -- DESPERATE BANGING on the door.

		UPSET VOICE (O.S.)
	C'MON, KAUFMAN!  Christ, you're ON!

Andy awakens.  He smiles.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - NIGHT

The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" begins playing.  Then, ANDY
strides in, a sneer on his grungy face.  The crowd SCREAMS
and BOOS pure pile.  Andy is euphoric, loving the hatred.

Down in the front row sit Stanley, Janice, Zmuda, and Lynne.
Several PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures of the parents.  They
squint, unused to all this.

Andy prances into the ring.  He takes the mike.

		ANDY
	Before we begin this event, I just
	wanna say a few things to you foul
	people.
		(beat)
	This city is filthy!  You
	Southerners live like pigs!  So I'm
	going to teach you some lessons in
	hygiene... bring you out of your
	squalor.

Holy cow.  The crowd is flabbergasted.  Women in K-mart
dresses gape.  Ruddy men in trucker caps glare.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Are you listening?
		(audience BOOS)
	OKAY!!!

Lynne snickers.  But Stanley and Janice are ashen-faced.

		JANICE
	Why is he saying these things?!

		STANLEY
	They're gonna lynch him!

		ZMUDA
		(he shakes his head)
	Nah.  He's just engaging a passive
	audience.

Andy reaches in his pocket and removes... a bar of SOAP.

		ANDY
	People, this is a bar of soap.  Does
	it look familiar to you?  If you wet
	it, it'll clean your hands.

Stanley's eyes bulge.

The crowd is enraged -- rumblings of imminent violence.

Andy smiles helpfully.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	And now, for your next lesson: This
	-- is toilet paper.

Andy holds up a ROLL OF TISSUE.

That's it.  The crowd goes NUTS.  Jerry Lawler races over
and snatches the mike, trying to maintain his dignity.

		LAWLER
	Kaufman, we've had enough!!  Let's
	you and me do what we came here for
	-- WRESTLING!

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - SECONDS LATER

And DING!  That's the bell!  Andy strikes a threatening
pose.  Lawler takes a step forward -- and Andy instantly,
cowardly, runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring.

BOOOOO!!!  Andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain:
I'm smarter.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And Kaufman's left the ring!
	Lawler's waiting for him to return.

		LYNNE
		(to Zmuda)
	Is this a strategy?

Lawler disparagingly frowns.  The REF checks his watch.
Andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring, gauging his
rival... then slowly climbs in --

Until the second Lawler moves.  Then Andy leaps back out!

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And Kaufman's left the ring again!
	He doesn't seem interested in
	actually making contact with his
	opponent.

Andy struts around the floor, pointing to his brain.  He
smirks at various spectators... until he finds himself face-
to-face with -- his parents.

An unexpected moment.  Andy's finger frozen on his brain.
Janice shakes her head despairingly.

		JANICE
	Andy, please.  Let's go home!

Cameras FLASH.  The paparazzi love these moments.

		ANDY
	Don't worry, Mom.  I'll make you
	proud...!

Beat -- then Andy gets HIT in the head with a cup.

People HOOT.  Disoriented, Andy returns to the ringside.
Lawler is losing his patience.

		LAWLER
	Hey!  Did you come down here to
	wrestle, or to act like an ass?

Andy paces around, unsure of his next move.

		LAWLER (cont'd)
	Look... if you get in here, I'll
	give you a free headlock.

Lawler leans down and offers his neck.

Andy peers skeptically.  People JEER.  Andy looks at waiting
Lawler... then tentatively climbs in.

As promised, Lawler doesn't move.  So Andy crosses over and
grabs Lawler's head!  Andy grins triumphantly.  He squeezes
his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment.

Until -- Lawler stands and flips him over.  Andy SLAMS DOWN
on his back.  CRUNCH!

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	It's a side suplex!!

Andy lies on the mat, unmoving.  Lawler doesn't care.  He
picks up Andy's prone body and grips it upside-down.  Janice
covers her eyes.  Stanley is worried.

		REFEREE
		(frantically
		gesturing)
	NO!  NO!

Lawler disregards the Ref and slams Andy's head in a pile-
driver!!

A horrible THUD.

DING!  The BELL immediately RINGS.

JANICE opens her eyes and SCREAMS.

		JANICE
	JESUS CHRIST!!!!!

		STANLEY
	Why isn't he MOVING??

Andy's parents' reaction is a fiesta for photographers.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER,
	which is an AUTOMATIC
	DISQUALIFICATION!  Match goes to
	Kaufman by disqualification, after
	two minutes, twelve seconds!
Andy is splayed unconscious.

Raging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his
head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on.

Lynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help.

		LYNNE
	ANDY!!!
		(frantic)
	Somebody get a DOCTOR!

		ZMUDA
		(yelling)
	WE NEED A STRETCHER!!

Stanley, totally numbed, holds Janice.  They're on the verge
of collapsing.  Tons of commotion.  Cameras FLASH
BLINDINGLY.  A stretcher is lifted into the ring.  Andy is
loaded on.  MUSIC fights the deafening NOISE.

BEDLAM.  Andy is carried through the crowd, followed by his
entourage.  A soft object HITS Stanley on the head.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Andy is being carried by the Coliseum EMPLOYEES into the
dressing room.  The entourage follows.  Zmuda pushes out the
crowd of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, and ONLOOKERS.  He slams
the door and locks it.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Janice runs to Andy's side.  She's crying.

		JANICE
	Andy!!  Are you okay?!?

Andy opens his eyes.

		ANDY
	I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.

A confused beat.

		STANLEY
	B-but... we saw... your neck...

		ANDY
	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked
	the whole thing.
		(beat)
	It didn't hurt at all.  It was just
	a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

Deadpan, Andy sits up.

Total silence.  Stanley stares... then a FURY comes over
him.

		STANLEY
	Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we
	knew, you were DYING!  Look at your
	mother -- she's still shaking!

Andy is splayed unconscious.

Raging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his
head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on.

Lynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help.

		ANDY
	But that's it.  I needed you to
	believe!  Our family will be in the
	newspapers.  People will look, and
	they'll be touched.  Because your
	emotions were honest!

Stanley has a blank expression.  But Janice starts to cry.

		JANICE
	Andy, I love you!  I love you,
	whatever you do...!

She hugs Andy tightly.

Andy is genuinely shocked.  He looks at his quivering
mother... and then his voice softens, truly remorseful.

		ANDY
	Geez, I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't
	have put you through all that...
		(quiet)
	Well, from now on, you'll always
	know the rule of thumb: Anything
	that happens to me... IS NOT REAL.

EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - NIGHT

A crowd of reporters parts.  They make way for Andy, who is
carried out on the stretcher and loaded into a waiting
AMBULANCE.  He is "unconscious."

Cameras CLICK and FLASH.  The ambulance speeds away, siren
WAILING.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Andy sits watching an OLD DOCTOR examining a number of x-
rays clipped to light panels.

		OLD DOCTOR
	I don't see any injury to your neck,
	Mr. Kaufman.

		ANDY
	Are you sure?

		OLD DOCTOR
	Positive.

		ANDY
	But my neck hurts... and I have a
	slight cough...

		OLD DOCTOR
	It's probably just a strained
	muscle.

		ANDY
		(intent)
	Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.

The Doctor gives up.

		OLD DOCTOR
	If it makes you happy...

George, Zmuda and Andy are looking through hundreds of
clippings from the newspapers.

		ZMUDA
		(reading aloud)
	"... has been rushed to a nearby
	hospital, where doctors are checking
	him for possible paralysis.  His
	parents are at his bedside.  Fans
	will best remember Kaufman as
	lovable Latka on television's
	Taxi"...

		ANDY
	It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my
	death, they'll really miss me.

		ZMUDA
	It's working for Elvis.

		GEORGE
		(sarcastic)
	Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin'
	for his comeback.
		(he sees an article
		and winces)
	God, listen to this!  "It was
	morally wrong to take advantage of
	such an unstable individual..."

		ZMUDA
	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of
	publicity!

George rolls his eyes.

		ANDY
	George, let's not drop the ball on
	this.  I've made some kind of cosmic
	career move.

Somebody KNOCKS outside.  Andy jumps up, puts on his neck
brace, and transforms himself into a shuffling invalid.  A
DELIVERY BOY drags in an enormous basket of flowers and
goodies.  Andy takes the card.  It reads "Andy, we're all
praying for you.  Your friends at Taxi."

Andy chuckles.

EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

George is eating with the Saturday Night Live Producer,
Lorne Michaels.  They're eating lunch in an outdoor cafe.

		GEORGE
	Thanks for seeing me on such short
	notice.
		(he takes a careful
		beat)
	I... I wanted to talk to you about
	booking Andy on "Saturday Night
	Live."

Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably.  He chooses his words.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	George -- I don't know if Andy works
	for our show anymore.  That
	wrestling stuff... is such a
	turnoff.

		GEORGE
	We agree completely.
		(tactfully begging)
	Andy has to reconnect with his core
	audience.  So I got him on Letterman
	tonight.  He's gonna apologize to
	Jerry Lawler, then repent for all
	his bad guy shenanigans.

Lorne Michaels mulls this over.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	That's smart.

		GEORGE
	He's very sincere.
		(quietly emphatic)
	And he needs your show...

Beat.  Lorne Michaels nods.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	Okay.  It'd be good to have the old
	Andy back.

INT. DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW - NIGHT

Andy and Jerry Lawler are on DAVID LETTERMAN'S show.  Andy
is pallid, hair shaggy, in a neckbrace and tweed jacket.
Husky Lawler wears loud red pants and gold chains.

Andy speaks timidly, seeming a bit dazed and regretful.

		ANDY
	I apologize for all the wrestling
	I've ever done.  I'm sorry for all
	the abuse I've ever given...
		(soft)
	I was just playing bad guy wrestler.
	That's not me... it's just a role.
	But Jerry took it personally.

Lawler and Letterman are unimpressed.

		LETTERMAN
	You said some pretty inflammatory
	things.

		LAWLER
	He thinks everything's a joke -- but
	it's not.
		(to Andy)
	Did you laugh when you were layin'
	in the hospital??

The crowd WHOOOOS.

Angst flickers on Andy's sweaty face.  He stammers.

		ANDY
	T-there wasn't a reason to purposely
	hurt me --

		LAWLER
	You're a wimp.

		ANDY
		(upset)
	My father said I should've gotten a
	lawyer --!

		LAWLER
	Then your father's a wimp.

		ANDY
		(losing it)
	And you're just poor white trash!

Lawler's had enough.  Enraged, he wildly stands and SLAPS
Andy.

BAM!

Andy crashes over and falls from his chair.

THUD.  He's on the floor.

Dead silence.  Everyone is astonished.

They're all slack-jawed.  Even PAUL SHAFFER.  Trying to
cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a ROCKABILLY TUNE.

Andy jumps up, crazed.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT!

Lawler freezes in his seat.  Letterman hides behind his
desk.

Andy storms over, out-of-control.  From a safe distance, he
starts SCREAMING at Lawler.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I
	WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING
	ASSHOLE!
		(he POUNDS the desk)
	FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU
	FOR THIS!!!

Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out.

		LETTERMAN
	You said some pretty inflammatory
	things.

	He thinks everything's a joke -- but

cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a ROCKABILLY TUNE.

Andy jumps up, crazed.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT!

Lawler freezes in his seat.  Letterman hides behind his
desk.

Andy storms over, out-of-control.  From a safe distance, he
starts SCREAMING at Lawler.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I
	WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING
	ASSHOLE!
		(he POUNDS the desk)
	FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU
	FOR THIS!!!

Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out.

The crowd CHEERS rowdily.

An unsure moment.  Dave glances at Lawler.

Until, Andy stumbles back in.  He tries to calm himself.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I am sorry.  I am sorry to use those
	words on television.  I apologize!
	I'm sorry!
		(demented)
	But YOU -- you're a MOTHERFUCKING
	ASSHOLE!!!!

Andy slams Dave's desk.  Dave jerks nervously.

Crazed, Andy looks down at Dave's coffee cup.  Uh-oh.
Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and DUMPS it on Lawler!

Lawler jumps, burned.  A SECURITY GUARD runs in.

Andy screams and hurtles away.  He slams open the stage door
and barrels out of sight.

INT. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE - ONE WEEK LATER

A SMUG COMIC stands on stage, speaking into camera.  The
show's going out live.

		SMUG COMIC
	Hi.  Um, we were supposed to have
	Andy Kaufman on our show this week -
	- but now our producers aren't sure
	if it's such a good idea.
		(beat)
	Some of us at Saturday Night Live
	think Kaufman's a comic genius.  But
	others disagree... they say he's
	just not funny anymore.
		(beat)
	So we're putting the decision up to
	you.  Please call up and vote.  To
	keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618.  To
	DUMP him, call...

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

Tight on Andy, staring at the LA Times.  A small headline
says "JOKESTER ANDY KAUFMAN VOTED OFF 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'"

He is bothered.

		ANDY
	This is bad... I only got 28
	percent!  I'm like McGovern in
	'72...

George sighs.

		GEORGE
	And this wasn't "Merv."  This was
	the hippest audience on television.
		(grim)
	They've turned on you.

At that... we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to
Andy.  But only the back of his head is visible.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	It's like you two guys wanted to
	destroy Andy's career!  Upsetting
	all those people... putting out that
	toxic venom...
		(helpless)
	What did you THINK would happen?!

		ANDY
		(guilty)
	We were just trying to push the
	envelope --

		GEORGE
	You're BLIND!  There is no envelope
	anymore!!
		(beat)
	It hurts me to say this... but
	there's only one solution --
		(pained)
	I don't want you two to ever work
	together again.

We WIDEN...

And the other person is JERRY LAWLER.  He feels bad.

		JERRY LAWLER
	I'm sorry.  We thought it was
	funny...

		ANDY
	Jer', it's not your fault.  You were
	terrific.
		(sad)
	But maybe George is right...

		JERRY LAWLER
	That's fine.  But I wouldn't have
	traded it for anything...
		(poignant)
	Because for one brief, shining
	moment... the world thought that
	wrestling was real.
Andy gulps emotionally.

		ANDY
	We'll stay in touch.  Next time I'm
	in Memphis, I'll stop by the house,
	and Noreen can make me her double
	chocolate cake.

		JERRY LAWLER
	Alright, buddy...
		(choked up)
	Stay good.

Andy and Jerry hug.

A touching beat... until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam.

		ANDY
	Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I
	can go back on the show, and say it
	was rigged.  Demand a recount...

		GEORGE
	Andy!  You don't get it!
		(somber)
	They don't want you back.

Andy's face drops.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

The Yogi slowly walks down the corridor, deep in thought.  A
few DISCIPLES IN TURBANS mill around.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY

NINE STUDENTS, sitting in the Lotus position, are listening
to a teacher.  The teacher is Andy.

		ANDY
	Open your eyes... close your eyes...
	open your eyes... close your eyes...
	open your eyes... close your eyes...

Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are
blinking their eyes faster and faster.

The door opens.  The Yogi sticks his head in.

		YOGI
	Excuse me, Andy...

		ANDY
	Yes, your Holiness?

The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

Andy steps out.

		YOGI
	This is very difficult for me to
	say... but -- perhaps it would be
	best if you didn't attend the
	retreat.

		ANDY
		(surprised)
	Why??  I... I attend every year.

		YOGI
	Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion
	to TM.  But we feel that perhaps...
	you and the program have grown apart
	philosophically.

Andy is stunned.

		ANDY
	"Philosophically"?

		YOGI
		(he sighs)
	The wrestling... the sexist
	remarks... the foul language...
	these things are not becoming of an
	enlightened individual.
		(beat)
	It seems you have no respect for
	anything.

Andy is stupefied.  He doesn't know how to respond.

		ANDY
	Of course I do...

The Yogi shakes his head.  Andy can't believe it.  He looks
around -- men in turbans staring at him.

Andy cracks.

		ANDY
	Please!  You've GOT to let me take
	the classes!  It's how I keep myself
	BALANCED!!

		YOGI
	It is apparently not working.

		ANDY
	So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is
	MEDITATE!!

		YOGI
		(pained)
	Andy, don't raise your voice.  We
	don't wish your presence here.

Andy is broken.

He fights to bottle his rage -- then notices Little Wendy
down the corridor, peering helplessly.  Beaten, Andy waves
goodbye to her.

Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Middle of the afternoon, Andy lies in bed.  Covers pulled up
to his face, expression glum, he's like a tragic still-life.

Suddenly DING-DONG!  It's the doorbell.

Andy ignores this.  Beat.  Another DING-DONG!  Then
KNOCKING.

		ANDY
	Go away.

		LYNNE (O.S.)
	It's me.

		ANDY
	Oh, it's open.

The door opens.  Lynne enters, holding a carton of ice
cream.

		LYNNE
	I brought you Haagen Dazs.
	Chocolate.

		ANDY
		(mournful)
	I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a
	horrible person.

		LYNNE
	Andy, you're not horrible.  You're
	just... complicated.

		ANDY
	You don't know the real me.

		LYNNE
	Andy... there is no real you.

TIGHT - ANDY

An astonished silence.

And then... he slowly smiles.

		ANDY
	You're probably right.

They both giggle.

Andy studies her... looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes.
Pause.

		ANDY
	Do you wanna move in together?

Lynne smiles slyly.  She leans down and kisses him.

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

A moving van outside a funky 60's house.  MOVERS carry boxes
in.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Andy sits disoriented in the living room.  Movers bustle
around him.  Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls --
and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of
himself.

In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out.
Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll.  He
smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases.

Suddenly a phone on the floor RINGS.  He grins.

		ANDY
	Hey!  Our first phone call!
		(he scrambles for
		the phone)
	Hello?

		GEORGE (V.O.)
	Andy... it's me.  I've got some
	crummy news.
		(long beat)
	Taxi's been canceled.

Silence.

Andy has no response.

		GEORGE (V.O.) (cont'd)
	Do you want me to come over?  Talk
	about it?

		ANDY
	Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right
	now.  Thanks.  We'll get together
	next week.

Andy hangs up.  He just sits there... confused... unsure how
to react.

Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd.  He
goes over to the mirror.  On the back of his neck... is an
inflamed red pimple.  Andy grimaces.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Yuck!

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT

Very late -- a clock says 1:15.  A YOUNG COMIC is onstage,
performing to the DOZEN audience members left.

In back walks... Andy.  Unshaven, morose, he quietly
approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN.  Budd sees him,
grins, and gives him a hearty hug.  Andy points at the stage
and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods.

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Budd is onstage.

		BUDD
	And now we have a treat for you late-
	night diehards.  The star of Taxi --
	here in person, Andy Kaufman!

The sparse crowd APPLAUDS.  Budd leaves, and Andy shuffles
up.

		ANDY
	Actually, Budd, you're wrong.  I
	found out today that Taxi's been
	canceled.

The crowd AWWWWS sadly.  Andy blinks.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Yeah, that's how I felt too...
	though I don't know why.  'Cause for
	years, all I wanted to do was get
	off that show.
		(quiet, very
		confessional)
	But now that nobody will hire me,
	and nobody thinks I'm funny... I
	guess it was probably a pretty good
	job.

One guy LAUGHS sharply.

Andy gives him a look -- thinks -- then continues.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Not to mention that my wife has left
	me.  And she took the kids.
		(he sighs)
	I don't know what I'm gonna do with
	myself.  My options are sorta
	limited...
		(beat)
	This morning, I noticed I've got a
	cyst, or some kind of boil, on the
	back of my neck.  It's really
	disgusting.  Look.

Andy turns.  The red lump is bigger, grosser.  The crowd
GROANS, revolted.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	So I was thinking, since I'm sort of
	a quasi-celebrity, that I could
	charge people to touch it.
		(candid)
	Does anybody want to pay a buck to
	touch my cyst?

A couple stoners GIGGLE and CLAP.  Andy COUGHS, then frowns.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'm serious.

A pause... then a few curious people walk up to the stage.
The first taker is a GOOFY BLONDE WOMAN.  She starts to
reach for the cyst -- when Andy stops her.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	No, no, you gotta pay first.

She nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse...

A BUSBOY sweeps up.  Budd counts money in the cash register.
Andy shuffles out of the showroom.  He waves some bills.

		ANDY
	I made six bucks.  That's good
	money.

Budd stares sadly.

		BUDD
	This is a comedy club -- not a
	medical sideshow.
		(trying to be kind)
	If you wanna perform here, take a
	shower, get some sleep, and pull
	yourself together.  Come back and do
	the material that people love: Do

George is driving down Melrose, listening to the radio.  He

It says "ANDY KAUFMAN - 9 P.M."

INT. LA IMPROV, LOBBY - THAT NIGHT

Puzzled George hurries inside.  COMICS greet him: "Hey
George!"  "George, you got a second?!"  George distractedly
waves and moves through.  At the showroom door, he finds
Budd.

	Hey, what's going on here?

		BUDD
	George, you won't believe it... I

	And he's killin' them!

Inside, there's HUGE LAUGHTER.  George's eyes widen.
Piqued, he goes in...

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - NIGHT

And it's packed!  Andy is onstage, playing struggling,
lovable Foreign Man.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	... but one ting I do not like is
	too much traffic.  Tonight I had to
	come on de freeway, and it was so
	much traffic...
		(giggling)
	It took me an hour and a half to get
	here!

Foreign Man chuckles pathetically.

The crowd HOWLS.  Andy's rockin'.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	But talking about the terrible
	things: My wife.  Take my --

		INTERRUPTING JERK
	"Take my wife, please take her."

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	T-take my wife, please take her...

The rhythm is thrown.  A couple laughs.

A flustered pause.  Andy glances down, then continues.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	No really, I am only foolink.  I
	love my wife very much.  But she
	don't know how to cook --

		INTERRUPTING JERK
	"Her cooking is so bad, is
	terrible."

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	H-her cooking...
		(Andy stumbles
		uncomfortably)
	Uh, cooking is so bad, is terrible.

The laughs are weaker.  The act is getting wrecked.

IN BACK - George grimaces.  Who the hell's doing this??

Angry, George hurries down front, looking for the loud jerk.
He scans the tables... and it's Zmuda.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	But right now --

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	"But right now I would like to do
	for you some imitations.  First, the
	Archie Bunker."

Andy freezes up.

The audience is embarrassed.

A frazzled confusion, then Andy drops the accent.  He glares
at Zmuda.

		ANDY
	Sir, do you have a problem?

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	Yeah, my problem is you're tired.

Andy winces.

		ANDY
	I, I was asked to do this material -
	-

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	Sure, because your new stuff's a
	bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are
	sick of you.  The wrestling... the
	hoaxes...

		ANDY
		(defensive)
	Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in
	the papers --

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!

GEORGE - is dumbfounded.

		GEORGE
		(to himself)
	Why...?  Andy, why...?

ON ANDY AND ZMUDA

		ZMUDA
	I used to think you were original.

		ANDY
	I was very original!

		ZMUDA
	Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now,
	you're creatively bankrupt.
		(he gleams cruelly)
	In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen,
	Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me
	to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant.
	It's just a fresh coat of paint on
	an old broken-down routine.
		(back to Andy)
	Isn't that true???

Andy shudders.

The audience averts their eyes.

A painful silence.

"Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed.

EXT. LA IMPROV - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy and George walk sadly down the street.  There is a
horrible gloom over them.

		ANDY
	The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks.
	So I was just giving 'em what they
	want...

		GEORGE
		(sadly)
	Andy, they don't think you suck.
	They've just... lost a reason to
	love you.

The guys stop walking.  George gently speaks.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	You've gotta make the public embrace
	you again.  You have to win back
	their sympathy...

He nods.

	Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been
	worried sick... NOW??... Where do
	you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call

Lynne's baffled.

INT. DENNY'S - DAWN

Late-night Hollywood weirdos mill about.  Andy sits with
bleary Lynne, Zmuda, and George.  Zmuda admires the menu.

		ZMUDA
	Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs,
	two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes
	-- $2.99!  How do they do it?

		LYNNE
	They get you on the coffee.

		GEORGE
		(irritable)
	Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us
	why we're here???

All heads turn.  A long pause.

Then -- Andy stiffly speaks.

		ANDY
	I have cancer.

Beat.  Zmuda nods.

		ZMUDA
	Hey, that's good!  We can make that
	play.

	And we'll really drag it out.  You
	get better, you get worse... you

	FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste!
	I want nothing to do with this.

Pause.  Lynne is puzzled.

		LYNNE
	Andy, are you serious?

		ZMUDA

	Serious like a heart attack!  Hey,
	maybe I can push you around in some
	goofy wheelchair!

Andy softly shakes his head.

		ANDY
	No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.

		GEORGE
	That's ridiculous.  You don't even
	smoke.

		ANDY
		(emphatic)
	I -- I got some freaky rare kind.
	It's called large-celled carcinoma.

Lynne's eyes tear up.  She hugs onto Andy.

		LYNNE
	Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?

		ANDY
	They don't know... they've gotta run
	more tests.

		LYNNE

	Have you told your family?

		ANDY
	No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad --
	I've jerked 'em around so many
	times.

George and Zmuda glance skeptically at each other.  Hmm...
Confused, George leans in to Andy.

	Andy... you look me in the eye, and
	tell me this is true.

Andy gulps.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

Andy is doing laundry.  He empties the clean clothes, puts
them in a basket, and carries them to the rug.  Then he sits
down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly
symmetrical patterns.  Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly
orders the socks like the world depended on it.

Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked.  She stares in
frustration at Andy's behavior.

		LYNNE
	How can you be so casual??!

		ANDY
		(he shrugs)
	Even if I'm dying -- I still need
	clean socks.

		LYNNE
	You're NOT DYING!

		ANDY
	Okay.  You're probably right.

He keeps working.  Lynne loses it.

		LYNNE
	God, you're so detached!!

Lynne storms out.

Andy finishes his socks.  Satisfied... he turns on the TV.

ON THE TV: It's "Lassie."  Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed,
with a broken leg.  Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book.
Lassie places the book on his lap.  The boy smiles
gratefully.

		TIMMY (ON TV)
	Thank you, girl.  You're my best
	friend.

Timmy warmly embraces the dog.

ANDY - is terribly touched.  Tears start rolling down his

Michael and Carol listen to a BLAND DOCTOR in a white coat.

		DOCTOR
	The cancer started in Andy's left

	initiated an aggressive radiation
	program... see if we can eradicate
	the affected cells.

	Excuse me.  I'll be right back.

The doctor leaves.  A somber silence -- and then Janice
bursts into tears.  Stanley hugs her tightly.

Carol watches the doctor with great hostility.  His old
tennis shoes are grabbing her attention.  He leaves, and she
frowns.

		CAROL
	What a crock.

		STANLEY
		(angered)
	How dare you make light of this!

		CAROL
	Dad, I cried when he broke his neck.
	He's not gettin' me again --

		STANLEY
		(impassioned)
	Jesus!  He's got lung cancer!

A standoff moment.  Carol loses it.

		CAROL
	See, that's exactly it!  He picked
	lung cancer, because he doesn't
	smoke.  That makes it weird!  If
	he'd picked leukemia, it'd be
	totally believable, and we'd all be
	going, "Poor Andy, he's really
	sick."  So he chose lung cancer,
	because he WANTS us to be scratching
	our heads, saying, "Is this real?"

		JANICE
		(trying to convince
		herself)
	Of course it's real.  We're in a
	hospital...

		MICHAEL
	Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a
	showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio
	friends probably run this place!

		CAROL
	He plans these things out.  He takes
	over, hires actors...
		(beat)
	Personally, I didn't think that
	"doctor" was very convincing.

		MICHAEL
	Did you notice his costume had the
	wrong shoes?

		CAROL
		(excited)
	Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes!

A moment of total silence.  All four of them look at each
other.  Is there... a glimmer of hope?

	We all know he's talked about faking
	his own death...

	Sure -- but what if he isn't?

The house is dark.  Lynne leads George into the shrouded

	What was that all about?

		ANDY
	It's visualization therapy.  He's
	helping me turn inward and fight the

Long beat.

	He's an actor.  I remember him in

	Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's

ON ANDY - An unspoken tension.  Then suddenly, he breaks
down.

	George, what am I supposed to do?!
	I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get

	You must take a little pleasure in

	Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop!
	Because if these bad vibes get

	-- I'm dead.

Andy struggles to remain composed.  George sighs.

	So how can I help you...?

	I wanna go back to work and put on a

	Carnegie Hall...!

George gently smiles.

INT. NATIONAL ENQUIRER OFFICES - DAY

A STAFF meeting at the National Enquirer.

		REPORTER #1
	I'm working on a great cover story:
	I've got a guy in the lab at Cedars.
	He says Andy Kaufman is dying of
	lung cancer.

Beat.  The room GROANS.

		EDITOR
	What bullshit!  No.  No more Kaufman
	stories!  He's burned us too many
	times!

		REPORTER #2
	Yeah, he's definitely not dying.
	He's playing Carnegie Hall next
	month!

The Reporter frowns.

		REPORTER #1
	Jesus.  Only Kaufman would use
	cancer as a publicity stunt.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - NIGHT

A 16mm PROJECTOR runs a scratchy 1930's movie short on the
wall.  Smiling fake COWBOYS and COWGIRLS dance, the cowgirls
straddling hobby horses.  They all SING.

		COWBOYS AND COWGIRLS
	"I've got spurs
	 That jingle-jangle jingle..."

WE WIDEN

Andy, George and Zmuda watch.  Andy's face is enthralled
like a kid.

		ANDY
	This is great.  The crowd's gonna
	love this!
		(giddy; thinking)
	Hey... do you still think any of
	those cowgirls are still alive?

		ZMUDA
	I dunno.  If they were, they'd be
	pushin' 80.

		ANDY
	Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get
	one on the show.
		(excited)
	I want the evening to build and
	build.  It's gonna have the most
	incredible ending: Singers, dancers,
	the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the
	sky opens, and Santa Claus comes
	flying down!

		ZMUDA
	And you say, "Santa, what am I
	gettin' for Christmas?"  And he
	says, "Cancer!"

		ANDY
	No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I
	want this show to be positive!

		GEORGE
	That's great... but this show's
	gonna cost a fortune.  Even if it
	sells out, you'll still lose eighty
	grand.

Andy smiles.

		ANDY
	I don't care about the money.  I
	just want the show to deliver.

		GEORGE
	So who's gonna pay for it?

		ANDY
	Tony Clifton.

		GEORGE
		(beat)
	You know Tony doesn't have that kind
	of money.

		ANDY
	Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony
	better than you do.  Even if he has
	to work another ten years to pay it
	off, he'll do it!

Pause.  George considers this -- then slowly nods.

		GEORGE
	Okay, Andy.  Will do.

INT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY

Andy silently sits.  The doctor and two NURSES administer a
chemo drip into Andy's body.

He stares at the needle in his arm.

The chemo begins.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

A dressy NEW YORK CROWD pushes into Carnegie Hall.  The
marquee says "ANDY KAUFMAN."

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

The show is on.  Andy effusively PLAYS his conga drum and
SINGS nonsense words to "Allouette, Gentille Alloutte."

		ANDY
	Abbu daba, abi abbu daba!  Abbu
	daba, abu dabu do!
		(to the crowd)
	Abbu dabbu da ba do...!

Everyone repeats.  In the audience, George sings along too.

		AUDIENCE
	ABBU DABBU DA BA DO!!

		ANDY
	A ba du ba ti la ma na go!

	A BA DU BA TI... LA... MA NA GO...

	Abbu da ba du ba ti lama na gobo abi

		AUDIENCE
	ABBU DA BA DU...

The crowd hopelessly breaks out LAUGHING.

ANDY laughs along.  They're all having a good time.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

The corny "Jingle Jangle Cowboy" MOVIE is playing on a big
screen.  It finishes.  Beaming Andy grabs the mike.

		ANDY
	Ladies and Gentlemen!  I'm pleased
	to announce that we have with us the
	one surviving cowgirl from that 1931
	film, Eleanor "Cody" Gould!!

Crazed APPLAUSE.  Frail ELEANOR GOULD, 75, comes onstage.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	It's such an honor to have you here.

		ELEANOR
		(squinting into the
		lights)
	Andy... this is so overwhelming...

		ANDY
	Well, it's gettin' even better!
	'Cause we found one of the original
	hobby horses!  Do you -- do you
	think you could treat us to a few
	steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"?

Eleanor starts to protest -- but Andy hands her the HOBBY
HORSE.  She blushes.  Andy turns away, goes to the band, and
starts conducting.  They begin to PLAY "JINGLE JANGLE
JINGLE."  Eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles.

Andy gets excited and conducts FASTER.  Eleanor is sweating.
She dances faster.

Andy impatiently SPEEDS UP the MUSIC MORE.  Eleanor
desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up... when
suddenly she grabs her heart.

Eleanor stops -- and collapses.  She's down.

A horrified GASP from the crowd.  The band stops playing.
CREW MEMBERS run on from backstage.  One checks her heart.
She's not moving.  Zmuda runs out, horrified.

		ZMUDA
	Is there a doctor in the house??!

The crowd is stunned silent.  Pause -- then one man stands.

It's Michael.

Straight-faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the
aisle, and goes on stage.  Michael checks her pulse and
loosens her blouse.  He presses Eleanor's chest, trying to
restart her heart.  But then -- he shakes his head sadly.
She's dead.

The crowd MOANS sadly.  Michael covers Eleanor with a
jacket.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Andy watches, pleased.  Suddenly, he COUGHS harshly.  Andy
drinks some water.  Pause... then he puts on a goofy Indian
headdress and runs back out.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

Eleanor lies dead.  Andy skips over and starts doing an
Indian war dance around her body.  The crowd is baffled.
Andy WHOOPS, he CHANTS... and then Eleanor starts to rise!

He WHOOPS triumphantly.  She lives, like Frankenstein
reborn!  The crowd CHEERS, surprised and giggling.

		ANDY
	Ladies and Gentlemen, she's alive!

Huge APPLAUSE.

		CHOIR (O.S.)
	HALLELUJAH!  HALLELUJAH!

		ANDY
	Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon
	Tabernacle Choir!!!

Rear curtains part, and the MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR belts
out the "Hallelujah Chorus"!

It's spectacular.  The crowd goes nuts.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Oh my gosh, it's the Rockettes!

Yes indeed, TWO DOZEN ROCKETTES rush in from the sides, legs
kicking high.

The crowd WHOOS.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Girls and Boys, it's Santa Claus!!

Snow start falling, and SANTA ON HIS SLEIGH drops from
above.

The crowd screams with excitement.  It's unbelievable.  They
leap to a standing ovation.

In front are Stanley and Janice.  They start crying.

Beaming Andy embraces Eleanor.  Then he takes the mike.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	And it's not over yet!!  'Cause I'm
	taking you all out to Milk and
	Cookies!!

The crowd laughs.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'm serious!!!!!!!

EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - MINUTES LATER

A thousand people file out -- and THIRTY-FIVE SCHOOLBUSES
are parked up and down Fifth Avenue!!!  The crowd is AWED.

Andy euphorically marches out, pushing his endurance.  He's
the Pied Piper.

		ANDY
	Single file!  Don't rush!  There's
	enough cookies for everyone!!

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER THAT NIGHT

The schoolbuses pull up to a school.  The disoriented
passengers step out, not sure what to expect...

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - NIGHT

The audience crowds inside... and LADY CAFETERIA WORKERS in
hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies.  It's remarkable.

At a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne.  Andy's face is
pure joy.  He watches all the adults munching on their
cookies, everyone giddy at the silliness of it all.

Andy smiles beautifully.  He squeezes Lynne's hand, then
whispers.

		ANDY
	I don't want this to ever end...

EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY

A stucco SPA RESORT sits in the middle of the rocky desert.

INT. SPA - SAME TIME

A room with soft lighting and billowing curtains.  A New Age
HEALER is laying crystals upon Andy's body.

Andy COUGHS.  His hat is off, revealing he's bald.

		HEALER
	Now we'll place a blue crystal.
	Very high vibrations.  It's
	wonderful for it's healing powers.

		ANDY
		(spellbound)
	Okay.  Let's try two of those... and
	one of the pink ones.

EXT. SPA - DAY

Zmuda stands with a swarmy ADMINISTRATOR.

		ADMINISTRATOR
	Your friend is doing four crystal
	sessions a day, but it's just not
	helping.

		ZMUDA
	I know...
		(beat)
	The cancer's terminal.

		ADMINISTRATOR
	Yes.  That wasn't made particularly
	clear to us when he checked in...

		ZMUDA
		(irked)
	Look, personally, I think rubbing
	rocks on people is a load of
	horseshit.  But if it makes Andy
	happy, that's all that matters.

The man purses his lips.

		ADMINISTRATOR
	I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we
	don't want to be "that health resort
	in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman
	died."
		(beat)
	I'm going to have to ask you to
	leave.

Zmuda is speechless.

INT. SPA, ANDY'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Zmuda angrily packs Andy's bags.  Zmuda is seething.

But Andy is strangely calm and unaffected.

		ANDY
	It's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really
	working.
		(a gentle smile)
	We'll find something better.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Lynne and Little Wendy are cooking Andy lunch.  Lynne mashes
up strange unidentifiable plant products.

		LITTLE WENDY
	What is this stuff?

		LYNNE
	It's all macrobiotic.  Millet,
	burdock root, kelp... Andy says
	it'll purify him.

Suddenly -- a SHARP VOICE.

		TONY CLIFTON (O.S.)
	What is that crap?  Looks like
	somethin' my dog would puke up!!

The women turn.  It's Andy -- dressed as Tony Clifton.

A spooked moment.

Tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there... but Andy
is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude.

		TONY CLIFTON
	How 'bout me and you dolls go get
	some REAL food:  French fries and a
	Porterhouse steak!

		LYNNE
		(not sure what to
		say)
	...Andy...?

Little Wendy's eyes pop:  Oh no she broke the rule!  Tony
gets very indignant.

		TONY CLIFTON
	I ain't Andy!  I'm Tony!  Andy's
	sick -- pick, chick, kick, lick!
	The doctor says he's a goner.
		(rousing himself)
	But Tony's built like a mule!  Andy
	asked me to be his pallbearer!  I'll
	do it for him!  I'm getting stronger
	and stronger!  Here, watch this!

Tony picks up a CHAIR and starts lifting it:  Up, down, up,
down.  Worried, the women rush to stop him.  They take the
chair.

		LYNNE
	Stop it!  C'mon, put that down.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Yeah, you're right.  We better get
	movin'.  We don't wanna miss Happy
	Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's
	you can drink for $4.99.

Tony jauntily turns to exit.  He gestures to the ladies.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Let's go!
		(he starts SINGING
		"New York, New
		York")
	"These vagabond blues,
	 Are washin' away.
	 I'll make a brand new start of
	it..."

Tony reaches the doorway -- and collapses.

He clutches himself in pain.

		LYNNE AND LITTLE WENDY
	Andy!!

Shocked, they run over.

Tony lies huddled on the ground.  He mutters sadly,
defeatedly.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Dammit...

					  CUT TO:

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DUSK

The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills.  Andy
and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out.
Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight.
He is a shadow of himself.

		ANDY
	I can't move my arm.

		GEORGE
		(awkwardly)
	You've got good days and bad days.

Andy softly sighs.

		ANDY
	My hair is coming out.

		GEORGE
		(whispers)
	Yeah...

George silently pats Andy.  Andy's energy is sapped, but he
forces himself to be upbeat.

		ANDY
	I've got an idea for a new TV show
	for me to star in.  It's called
	"Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be
	a Saturday morning thing where I can
	goof off with the kids.  You know,
	puppets, magic tricks...

George is choked up.  He goes along with it.

		GEORGE
		(long pause)
	I think we can sell that.

Silence.

George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.

Andy smiles gratefully.

		ANDY
	Hey... thanks for always backin' me.

George clenches Andy's hand.

		GEORGE
	Did your -- doctor say it's okay for
	you to go back to work?

		ANDY
	Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he
	had his way, I'd be stuck in the
	hospital, running tests all day.
		(beat)
	And anyway, I've found a new guy
	who's gonna be able to instantly
	remove the cancer.

		GEORGE
		(startled)
	Really?

		ANDY
	Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the
	Philippines, and he's amazing!  He
	rubs you and sucks the disease right
	out!

Andy beams.  George stares sadly.

		GEORGE
	The Philippines?  I dunno... Andy...
	he sounds like one of your
	characters.

TIGHT - ANDY

His voice gets hushed.

		ANDY
	No... this guy's special.
		(very sincere)
	He performs miracles.

George doesn't know how to respond.

Andy looks up pleadingly.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	He's my last chance.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY

Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city.

Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the
sky.  It hits a dirt runway.  Dust flies.  Chickens squawk
and run.

INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY

Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city.

Andy stares in amazement.

EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY

They reach a brick building.  A sign says "CLINIC," with an
eye over a triangle.

INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY

A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms.
Money is handed over.

Andy's clothes are stripped off.  They're thrown in a
locker.

INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY

A large white tiled room.  Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid
Andy, his limp body unmoving.

Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE.
Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their
underwear and barely able to stand.

They have a look of desperation and reverence.

At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A
bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels.

A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively
presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach,
kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY
GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The woman cries out.

Andy gasps.

The woman is helped away.

Jun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a towel
to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up...

Andy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear.
Nervousness.  Hope.

Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head.  He
concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The man shakes.  He is helped away.

Andy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer...

More patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing.

Andy's excitement builds.

Then -- he reaches the front.

A moment.

Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his
total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're
saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda
starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly.

Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the
wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench.

Andy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead.

He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the
previous patient.

Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle.

Jun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off.

Andy relaxes, readying for it all...

He glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- and
under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal
intestines.

Jun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake.

CLOSEUP - ANDY

A moment of stunned disbelief.

He is shocked.  Outraged.  Disappointed.  Flabbergasted.

The faith is meaningless.  The joke is cosmic.  The con man
has been conned.

Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to
LAUGH.

It's sidesplittingly funny.  Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and
LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy
releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks.

His face flushes with color.  Life sparkles in his eyes.
Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse.  This is the best
gag of them all.

				 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Andy lies in peace in a casket.  He has died.

His expression is pleasantly bland.  Almost Latka-like.  But
his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it
almost looks like a mask.

We slowly widen.  The casket is surrounded by beautiful
flowers.  We TILT UP... and high above... is a MOVIE SCREEN.

On the SCREEN is a projection of Andy, silently staring at
us.  There's a gentle smile on his face.  It's the image
from the opening of this film.

ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS.
All are in black.  Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock.

Andy's family is huddled.

Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying.

George gives Zmuda a hug.  Little Wendy comes over... and
they comfort each other.

Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays
cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger,
Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on...

And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions.  They
stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.

		ANDY (ON FILM)
	Well... My show is over.  I did my
	best, and I just want to say, until
	we meet again... please remember:
		(he begins to SING)
	"In this friendly, friendly world...
	 With each day so full of joy.
	 Why should any heart be lonely."

Some gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING.

		ANDY (ON FILM) (cont'd)
	So everybody!  Put your arm around
	the person next to you, even if you
	don't like that person.  Come on!
		(he resumes SINGING)
	"The world is such a wonderful
	place,
	To wander through,
	When you've got someone to love,
	To wander along with you.
	With the sky so full of stars,
	And the river so full of songs,
	Every heart should be so thankful,
	Thankful for this friendly, friendly
	world..."

The curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with
Andy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS.

The curtain closes.  The FILM ENDS.

And all goes silent.

Some people cry.  Some begin to leave.  Most of them are
just staying, numbed.

George and Zmuda whisper.

		GEORGE
	It's a perfect Kaufman audience.

		ZMUDA
	Yeah.  They don't know whether to be
	sad, or angry.

The Taxi cast are flustered.

		CAROL KANE
	Why are people leaving?  The
	curtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna
	come out... I know it!

		TONY DANZA
	Sure, the body was just made of
	wax...!
		(a very long beat)
	Wasn't it......?

Silence.  They look to the front.

The closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.

					FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT

A SUPER slowly appears:  "EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER"

On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards.
Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY.  Traffic on Sunset is
jammed.  HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.

Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes
pop.

		DUDE #2
	Oh my GOD.
		(stupefied)
	That's the freakiest thing I've ever
	seen!!  Look!

He points.  His friend turns -- and gasps.

AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!"

		DUDE #1
	Man, we were right!  He's not dead!

		DUDE #2
	He's just been lyin' low for a year!
	WE GOTTA GO!

Hysterical, the guys race up to the club.  But outside,
there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB.  People are screaming.
Police have barricades.  Everybody cries to get in.

INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME

It's packed.  Every square inch is filled with glittery
Hollywood VIPs.  People make chit-chat... but there is a
squeamish excitement in the air.  A brooding unease.  Nobody
knows what to expect.

Suddenly -- the lights go black.  A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Ladies and Gentlemen!  Please put
	your hands together for... Tony
	Clifton!

The THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.  "DAAAAA, DAAAAA,
DAAAAA!  DA-DAAAAA"!

A small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo.  The light grows
bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people
gasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is
revealed onstage!

It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response.
The crowd has no idea what to do.

Tony smirks.

		TONY CLIFTON
	How ya doin'?

Dead silence.

Tony struts downstage.  He waves to the crowd.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	How you doin' back there?!
		(to the front rows)
	How you doin' up here?!

Still no response.  Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.

		VOICE
	Andy!

Whoa.  The crowd rustles nervously.

Tony grimaces.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Don't know nothin' about no Andy.
	Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my
	coattails.
		(to the BAND)
	Let's HIT IT, boys!  One, two, anda
	one two three four!

The BAND kicks in with disco anthem "I WILL SURVIVE."  Tony
starts SINGING the schmaltzy opening:

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"First I was afraid
	 I was petrified.
	 Kept thinkin' I could never live
	 Without you at my side."
		(he wipes away a
		pretend tear)
	"Were you the one that tried to
	 Hurt me with goodbye?
	 Did you think I'd crumble?
	 Did you think I'd lay down and
	 Die...?"

We PAN the room full of enthralled spectators.  At a front
table are George and Lynne.

Tony attacks the chorus.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"Oh no not I!
	 I WILL SURVIVE!
	 As long as I know how to love,
	 I know I'll simply stay alive!"

In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling...
frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a
man in the very last row.

Bob Zmuda.

Enjoying the show more than anyone.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"I've got all my life to live
	 I've got all my life to give.
	 I will survive..."
		(he hits his big
		finish)
	"I -- WILL -- SURVIVE!!!"

The music CRESCENDOS, and the song ENDS.

Zmuda grins and APPLAUDS proudly.

					FADE OUT.

MAIN TITLES


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach
with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see
much of the background which is receding from us.
THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at
each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the
aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They
are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with
an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The
CAMERA STOPS at the end of the bus.


EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The French driver and a couple of his companions, Arab.


EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS,
photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the
screen is the destination board. By the time we get
opposite the window out of which the McKennas are
looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA --
MARRAKESH."


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window.
Jo's interest seems only casual.

                      HANK
          Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa
          before? It looks familiar.


INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

Shooting through the McKenna's window at the landscape
moving by. It is semiarid desert. A line of blue-
grey mountains in the distant.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo studies the landscape.

                      JO
          We saw the same scenery last summer
          driving to Las Vegas.

Hank turns, and smiles slightly.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus     is
entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and    plaster
building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys    and one
camel. A  few pedestrians, mostly Arab men, few    women.

Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.

                        JO
            This isn't really Africa, Hank.    It's
            French Morocco.

                         BEN
                (To her)
            Northern Africa.

                        HANK
            Still seems like Las Vegas.

                        BEN
                (Slightly indignant)
            We're only a hundred miles north of

          Dark Continent.
              (He squints)
          It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!

Jo and Ban smile at Hank.

                      BEN
          Just wait till you see Marrakesh.

                       HANK
          Marrakesh.   Sounds like a drink.

Ben runs his tongue across his lips.

                      BEN
          You bet it does.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open
desert once again. It looks parched and grim.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank
grows, restless. He looks about for something to do.
Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes.
Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her
place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the
bus and test its possibilities for adventure.

The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly
makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab
village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to
bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better
than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a
particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger.
In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to
grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only
succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman.
Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her
face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,

With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers
a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the
woman's veil.

The woman still covers her face, but from the seat
next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and
makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's
robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining
twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The
Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank,
repeating his demand.

People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the
reason for the trouble.

The bus driver scans his rear vision mirror for the

Hank looks up at the oncoming Arab, and retreats
uncertainly, not realizing he is still holding the
veil.

The Arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy
in furious Arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.

Two Arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats
apparently disturbed by what the brown-clothed Arab is
saying. They being talking among themselves.

Ben and his wife, Jo, are straining from their back
seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong.
Ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating
that Hank is involved.

Still staring straight at the Arab, both frightened
and fascinated by his verbal attack, Hank retreats.

Except for the French passengers, everyone in the bus
is in a state of disturbance. The Arab continues to
advance on Hank keeping up a steady tirade of Arabic.

Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his
son and the oncoming Arab.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother,
still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab
who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's
benefit.

                       BEN
          Now wait a minute.     Wait a minute.
          Simmer down.

The Arab continues pointing, talking.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes
rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the
Arab. He pushes in between the pair.

                         LOUIS
              (To Ben)
          Pardon me.

He turns to the Arab, moves him back   a little, sharply
silences his attack, and then begins,   in Arabic, to
explain firmly that the boy meant, no   harm. It was an
accident. The Arab isn't convinced,    points to Hank.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he
is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the
Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The
Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS
him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats,
growing quiet.


INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Hank and Jo relax. Ben addresses the Frenchman, a
pleasant-looking young man. He is LOUIS BERNARD.

          help, anything might have happened.

                      LOUIS
              (smiles pleasantly)
          A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments
          in life when we all need a little help.

                      BEN
          May I introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.

Louis turns pleasantly to Jo.

                      LOUIS
          How do you do, madame.      My name is
          Louis Bernard.

She returns his smile.

          Thank you, Mr. Bernard.

                      BEN
          And this is our son, Hank.

                         LOUIS
          Hallo, Hank.

He holds out his hand to Hank, who takes it.

                      HANK
          You talk Arab talk.

                         LOUIS
          A few words.

                      JO
          Why was he so angry?      It was an
          accident.

                       LOUIS
              (Half shrugs)
          The Moslem religion allows for few
          accidents.
              (To Ben)
          May I be permitted to sit down?

Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who
moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so
that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In
the rear windows behind them we see the retreating
landscape of French Morocco.

                      LOUIS
          How different.

                      BEN
          For Josephine. Called her Jo so long,
          nobody knows her by any other name.

                       HANK
          I do.   Mummy.

She smiles at Hank, rubs the back of his neck.

                      LOUIS
          Now about the "accident." You see, a
          Moslem woman never takes off her veil
          in public under any circumstances.

                      HANK
          They feed her intervaneously?

Louis looks at the boy with some surprise.

                      LOUIS
          Quite a big word for such a small boy.

                      BEN

          That's all right. We tried everything
          to got rid of them. We never thought
          of a Frenchman.

Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues
on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good

helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,
to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage
of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped
bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to
take the people to their various destinations in the
city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.

bags, and one belonging to Louis. Louis turns to Ben.

carriage. He picks up his own small bag.

Jo shakes her head.

          He was asking, you were telling. You
          might as well have handed him your
          passport.

                      BEN
          What difference does it make?    I have
          nothing to hide.

                      JO
          Maybe Mr. Bernard has.

                      BEN
          Jo. I know this is mysterious Morocco.
          Inscrutable natives gliding through
          twisted, narrow streets, but --

          Oh, Ben!

                      BEN
          Then relax. You're just mad because
          he didn't ask any questions about you.

She looks at him briefly without any expression.    Then
she malts into a smile.

                      JO
          Bitter medicine, doctor.   But I'll
          swallow it.

The carriage swings into the driveway of the Hotel
Mamounia. It is a rich-looking building, elegantly
landscaped. The CAMERA PANS it to the entrance of the
hotel. Several hotel employees move quickly to meet
it. They help the McKennas descend, and assemble the
baggage.

pushes her ahead of him   into the hotel. THE CAMERA

It is now evening, and we are in the double bedroom
and single bedroom of the McKennas in the Hotel
Mamounia. We are able to see through into the single
room where Hank is, brushing his teeth while his mother
supervises his getting ready for bed. Jo is already
dressed for the evening in a smart-looking outfit.
Ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror. He just
lust finished putting on his shirt.

At the far end of the room there is a   balcony over-
looking the hotel gardens. By a small    table stands
Louis Bernard dressed with unobtrusive   good taste. He
is looking into the garden beyond. On    the table are
glasses and a shaker of martinis.

In the single room occupied by Hank. Jo is putting

pajamas, but still has his shoos on.

                      HANK
          How about it, mummy?   One chorus.

                      JO
          I'm a little out of form, Hank.

                      HANK
          One chorus, and that's all.

                       JO

He tap dances a vamp introduction to the song. He's
quite professional. Then he stops, takes a pose, and
begins singing in a small, but not untalented voice.

                      HANK
          When I was lust a little boy
          I asked my mother "What will I be?"
          Will I be handsome?
          Will I be rich?
          Here's what she said to me:

Jo takes up the song. Her voice is obviously
professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful.

                      JO
          Que Sera Sera, whatever will

There is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on

          I asked my teacher "What should I try"

          Should I sing songs?
          This was her wise reply:

Hank looks up happily to his mother, as she sings to
him with love. Hank whistles a harmony accompaniment
to the next verse.

                      JO
          Now I have children of my own
          They ask their mother "What will I
          be?"
          Will I be handsome?
          Will I be rich?
          I tell them tenderly:

They sing the chorus in harmony together.

Just before they finish the song, there is a loud
knocking at the outside door. The song trails off.

          There goes our sock finish!

Ben goes to the door, tightening his tie on the way.
He opens it. A waiter is there with a tray of food.

from the back bedroom.

The waiter comes out of the bedroom, followed by Jo.

          of serving you a drink.

Jo takes a seat, and Louis leans against the railing.

                        JO
            Yes, I was on the American stage, and
            the London stage, and even the Paris

            The theater, requires time, and for me
            time is often a luxury.

                        JO

            What do you do for a living?

                        LOUIS

            What?

                        LOUIS
            Whatever gives the best profit.

She puts down     her drink with some exasperation. As
she does, she     glances back toward Ben. He's getting
his coat, but     pauses to give her a slight smile and a
look that says     "You're wasting your time."

                        JO
                (More firmly)
            Just what are you buying, or selling,

She opens it, and standing in the corridor is a
silhouetted figure. We cannot see the face. Jo
switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious

toward Louis Bernard for help in translating the French.

As the McKennas turn, the man in the doorway lifts
himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in
the direction of Louis Bernard.

The man immediately turns his attention back to Ben,
and begins talking in broken English.

                      RIEN

As Ben closes the door, we see that Louis Bernard has
been advancing into the room for a better look at the
man in the doorway,

                (To Ben)
            May I use your telephone?

Ben gestures that the phone is his. The CAMERA PANS
Louis to the phone, which he picks up, and begins
talking in French asking first for the operator, and a
certain number. Beyond that his conversation is a
mystery, because his face reveals nothing. (Possibly
speaks Arabic.)


INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT

As Louis Bernard talks on the phone, Ben goes to   pick
up his drink. He comes back into the room, as JO    enters
once again from the bedroom. She looks at Louis,    then
at Ben who shrugs his shoulders. Louis finishes    his
phone conversation, hangs up.

                        LOUIS
            I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go
            to dinner with you tonight.

I had neglected an important matter which now requires
my attention. Perhaps, another night...

He bows briefly and moves towards the door. The
McKenna's look at each other quite bewildered.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. FULL SHOT

The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an
Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has
a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on
cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding
in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently
serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen.
The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled
with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes.
Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in
the background. The light is supplied principally
from candles.

As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO
REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

          me please.

The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant,
The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben
is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at
the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through
her face.


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions
eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are
the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel
Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had
stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man
next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass
them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking
over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.

The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions
directly behind those of the two people who stared at
them.

                      HEADWAITER
          I think you will find this comfortable.

He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around
as if trying to find another seat.

          Ben...

                      BEN
          Sit down, Jo, please.   People are
          staring at us.

She sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful
and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall
and somewhat awkward, has trouble.

First he kneels, and then with much struggle manages
to fold his long legs underneath him.

He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his
antics, but instead her face is serious, and she has a
secret look about her. She leans close to him.

                      JO
          You're right. People are staring at
          us.

                         BEN
          What people?

She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people
sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but
all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns
back.

                      JO
          They stared at us when we went into
          the hotel.

                      BEN
          Jo, will you stop imagining things?


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look
behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind
him also turns. They are staring directly at each
other.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Good evening.

Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the
man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way
around toward Jo.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          You must think me awfully rude. I've
          been staring at you ever since I saw
          you at the hotel.

Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
              (She peers at Jo)
          You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?

Another angle, featuring the man, and Ben.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my
          husband.

                      DRAYTON
          How do you do, sir!

                      BEN
          How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs.
          McKenna.

                      DRAYTON
          My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared
          at the London Palladium a few years
          ago.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Of course we hardly ever see a show.
          Edward is such an old stick-in-the-
          mud. So I have to console myself with
          your records.

                      DRAYTON
          And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not
          one for this terrible Bee Bop or
          whatever you call it.

                       JO
              (Laughs)
          Thank you, Mr. Drayton.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          When are you coming back to London?

                      JO
          Possibly never again, professionally.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Don't tell me you've given up the stage.

                         JO
          Temporarily.

                      BEN

          I have nothing against working  in New

          it's very hard for my patients  to come
          all the way from Indianapolis  for
          treatment.

Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly.

          Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying
          the wrong thing.

We now find the Draytons and the McKennas are  sitting
in a group, eating dinner together. There is   no back
to back awkwardness. All  are busily tearing  whole
roast chickens apart with their bare fingers.   Drayton
holds a piece of chicken aloft, demonstrating  the proper
Arab method of eating.

                      DRAYTON
          Only the first two fingers and thumb
          of the right hand. Never use the
          smaller fingers. And always keep the
          left hand in the lap.

                      JO
          Does it have something to do with
          religion?

                      DRAYTON
          More social than religious, I'd say.

          It seems to me if you have four good
          fingers, and a thumb, you should use
          them all.

                      J0
          Three finger -- four fingers -- for my
          money this is nothing but chicken in
          the rough. We have it at every drive-
          in back home.

                      DRAYTON
          Well, as I was saying, I was quite
          happy farming my bit of land It
          Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from
          the United Nations started worrying
          me.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Edward was a big noise at the Ministry
          of Food during the war, you know.

                      DRAYTON
          So, I pulled myself up by the roots,
          and here we are. United Nations Relief.

                      BEN
          That sounds like interesting work.

Louis Bernard is standing in the entrance of the
restaurant. On his arm is a rather elegantly dressed
woman. She is also handsome and graceful. As he stands
waiting for the headwaiter, Louis Bernard looks around
the restaurant. His eyes stop when he comes to the
McKennas. He looks directly at them without the
slightest sign of recognition.

The headwaiter comes up to Louis Bernard, exchanges a
few words with him which we cannot hear, and then leads
the couple to a set of cushions in the far corner of
the room. As he moves away from the entrance, Louis
Bernard does not look at the McKennas.


INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners
watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but
the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize
that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or
speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.

                      JO
          Well just what do you think of that?
          First he promises to take us to dinner --

          and publicly insulted.

                      BEN
          Can you blame him? Turning down an
          old married couple for a date with a
          girl like that?

                       JO
          We're not an old married couple! All

          understand him -- and I'm beginning
          not to like what he's doing to our
          whole night.

Drayton, quietly amused, is listening to Ben and Jo.
But Mrs. Drayton is embarrassed. She makes conversation
at random.

              (To Drayton)
          I must do some shopping in the market
          tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine.
          Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I
          how our English weather is awful, but
          I sometimes think we don't know when
          we're lucky. All this sunshine, day
          after day. It seems unnatural, somehow.

Ben makes as if to rise, but Jo holds him down.

                      BEN
          I want to get up.

                      JO

          By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd
          let us show you round the market place,
          tomorrow.

                      JO
          Louis Bernard, the big buyer from
          Paris, was going to take us through
          the market tomorrow.

She pushes him down again.

                      JO
          Ben, don't. Our dinner's getting cold.
              (To the Draytons)
          We'd love to go with you.

Ben glares in Bernard's direction, and then picks up a
chicken leg.

                      JO
          I don't know why Ben gets so worked up
          over unimportant things.

Ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. Then
his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter
standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only
three fingers. Ben looks down at the chicken leg. He
is holding it gripped in his fist. This is too much.
He throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.

Over in the far corner of the restaurant, the lady

            C'est les deux que cherchez? (Is that

They stop short of bumping into Hank and Mrs. Drayton.

                      HANK
          Hey, Mummy.
              (He points)
          Sewing machines! Looks like a
          television commercial.

                      BEN
          Now If we could only get four cases of
          the Seven-year itch, we could retire.
          Or, if Mrs. Yarros really has triplets,
          we could at least redecorate the house.

                       J0
              (Laughs)
          Oh, Ben, what would they say if they
          heard us?


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANNING through the market place to a line
of veiled women all working at Singer sewing machines.
Drayton saunters behind them in the distance.

                      BEN
          One of the reasons I came to a place
          like Marrakesh is so that we could say
          things like this without anybody hearing
          us.

                       JO
          I'd like to say something where nobody
          can hear us.

                      BEN
          This is the safest place.

                      JO
          When are we going to have another child?

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

                      JO
          You're the doctor.   You have all the
          answers.

                      BEN
          Yeah -- but, but this is the first
          time I've heard the question!

They stop short of bumping into Hank and Mrs. Drayton.

                      HANK
          Hey, Mummy.
              (He points)
          Sewing machines! Looks like a
          television commercial.

Jo laughs appreciatively, and rumples his hair.

                      JO
          Having a good time, Hank?

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          He's delighted with everything.

At this moment, Mr. Drayton saunters up, and for the
first time the group is all together. Suddenly there
as some shouts in the distance. Everyone's attention
is drawn to the noise. Hank moves quickly, threading
his way through some people for a better look, the
CAMERA PANNING him away.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

From Hank's viewpoint we see police chasing a white-
robed Arab figure. The police consist of a couple of
uniformed French officials and two or three others in
local Arab dress, with rifles slung over their backs.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Hank, fascinated at the drama, dishes away to got a

Jo and Ben miss Hank.   Then see him moving through the
crowd.

                       JO
          Hank!

She starts forward after him, but Mrs. Drayton moves
faster than anyone. She passes both of the McKennas
and overtakes Hank.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton reaches down and takes hold of Hank's
shoulders, and pulls him toward her.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Hank, it's best to keep away from
          trouble.

Hank is looking away toward the chase.

                      HANK
          What's going on?

Mrs. Drayton looks toward the trouble.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          It looks as though the police are
          chasing somebody.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A closer view of the chase brings us back to where the
motor coaches are loading up, and for a moment the
police as lost to view.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high view of the open air tannery with its circles
of crude stone water tanks becomes the scene of a
further part of the chase. We see the white-robed
Arab leaping between the crude tanks with the police
yelling and running after him in the distance. The
difficulty of the obstacles enables the Arab to get
ahead of them, and we see that he is now able to dodge
through an archway into the grain market.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

As the chase passes through the grain market, it
scatters grain and grain sellers in every direction.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The pursued Arab dashes through an enclosure holding
the donkeys which are used to carry grain to and from
the market. There is quite a stampede, with the donkeys
running, kicking, and braying in fright.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

Through another archway the Arab now dashes down some
of the narrow streets of the Medina. Sapling branches
are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern
on the ground below.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the
police in pursuit, progress is made difficult by the
many shoppers and bicycle riders. One bicycle rider
trying to avoid the oncoming Arab turns and drives
helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of
wreckage is enormous.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The Arab turns into another street where the rows of
brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung
along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision
between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the
street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder.
In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated
with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and
hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab
continues on past. The police dash through the street
trying to avoid the dye themselves.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The Police reach a narrow intersection where the blind
beggars as squatting, begging alms. They pause. There
is no sign of their quarry. Then one of them points
to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left.
They take up the pursuit once again.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high, overhead shot of the narrow streets showing
that the police have caught sight of their man again.
But there seems to be something strange about the chase
now. Two white-robed Arabs are running. The second
Arab we haven't seen before, but he is faster than the
first man and is gaining on him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

A closer, level shot, the CAMERA PANNING, shows, the
two breathless men closing in on each other. As they
reach an intersection in the streets, lighted by a
shaft of sunlight, the new Arab comes up behind the
original man being chased and whipping out a knife
from under his robes, plunges it into the back of the
first man. Then he turns and quickly moves away into
a street on his left. The first Arab jerks his head
up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing,
Then he staggers into the dark shadows.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out
of sight for a moment so that the police continue their
chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted
down another side turning.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife
is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands,
vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM
as he staggers out into the open market place. His
shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the
knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA
MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and
shoulders as he attempts to go forward.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and
there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his
group.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Arab hesitates for  a moment, but the attitude of
his head shows us that  he has seen McKenna. He makes
his way desperately and  painfully toward him. He is
finding it difficult to  remain upright and even take
those last few steps.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view  of McKenna shows that those around him,
including his  wife and the Draytons, become frightened.
He spreads his  arms out to move them back protectively,
waiting to see  what is going to happen.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his
back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors
to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and
his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's
cheeks.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big close up of Ben's hands as his fingers slide off
the Arab's face. He turns his hands up and we see
they are covered with black grease paint.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

The Arab's head his now dropped to the ground, and we
see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark
makeup which Ben's fingers had scraped off.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better.   The
Arab gasps out something in French.

                      LOUIS
          Ils ont trouvés... ils ont réussi à
          trouver...

Ben looks at him puzzled.

                      LOUIS
              (English)
          McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard.

Ben is quite surprised.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then
reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and
examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with
one arm and grabs Ben by the coat.

                      LOUIS
          McKenna -- listen to me -- first!

With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until
Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort
Louis whispers to him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us
to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so
much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least
enough to make any sense out of what he says.

                      LOUIS
          A man...a statesman...is to be
          killed...assassinated...in
          London...soon...very soon...tell
          them...in London...to try Ambrose
          Chappell...

Presently, the mouth stops speaking.    It remains still
and open.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open
mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the
robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly
withdraws. Ben rises.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard,
the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a
large flat cement section of the market place. The
Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash
quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis.
Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and
Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the
rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines
it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis
Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo
turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to
the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to
Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes
out a pen.

                      JO
          Ben -- who is he?

                      BEN
          Louis Bernard. Got something to write
          on?

She begins looking in her purse.

                        JO
          Is he dead?

           Yes. Yes. He's dead.

She   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it
out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book
end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches
him   with mystified curiosity.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also
seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the
notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the
pen. Before either man can comment on the writing,
the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French.

                       POLICE ONE
           Savez vous qui est cet homme?

The uniformed French policeman approaches Ben.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman repeats his question as he stops in front
of Ben.

                       POLICE
           J'ai dit: Savez vous qui est cet homme?

Drayton steps forward to help.   He addresses the police.

                       DRAYTON
           Il ne parle pas francais.   Je traduirái.

The policeman nods.   Drayton turns to Ben.

                       DRAYTON
           He wants to find out if you know this
           man.

The policeman watches their faces.

                       JO
           Of course we know him!
               (She points)
           It's the frenchman, Louis Bernard.

Her gestures, and her comments, although In English,
give the policeman all the information he needs.

                       POLICE ONE
               (Looks at body)
           Louis Bernard?

He moves away toward the body, which the other policemen
are now covering with a sheet.

He gives them some instructions in French.

Ben looks at Jo in a way that says "Who asked you to
say anything."

The French policeman returns to the group.    He addresses
Drayton.

                      POLICE MAN
          Quel est le nom de ces personnes?

                      DRAYTON
          McKenna.

                      POLICE MAN
          Dites leur que j'aimerai qu'ils viennent
          tous les deux au commissariat pour
          faire un rapport.

Drayton nods unhappily, and turns to Ben and Jo.

                      DRAYTON
          Just as I thought. He wants both of
          you to go to police headquarters to
          make a statement.

                      BEN
          Do we have to?

                      DRAYTON
          I'm afraid so.
              (He turns to wife)
          Our friends here have to go to the
          police Station. I'm going with them
          to give what help I can.

Mrs. Drayton comes up to the group, still holding on

          do you?

          station before.

          Alons-y.   Sil vous plait.

Police Two moves across the square with Drayton. Ben
and Jo precede them. Drayton begins conversing in
French with them about the crime, but we cannot
distinguish their words clearly. Jo looks back and
gives a little wave to Hank.


EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The McKenna's are walking across the square with the
Police and Drayton a few yards behind them. The CAMERA
MOVES with them. Jo moves close to Ben and speaks to
him in a surreptitious manner.

                      JO
          Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab-
          outfit, wearing makeup?

                      BEN
          What's more important -- why was he
          killed?

                      JO
          I'll bet he was a spy, or something
          like that.

Ben looks at her with some surprise.

                      JO
          Ben, what did he whisper to you?    What
          did you write down?

                      BEN
          I'll tell you later.

Ben looks at his hands.

                        JO
          What is it?

                      BEN

          said about Louis Bernard last night.

The main hallway and waiting room of the Police Station
in Marrakesh. French and Arab personnel move up and
down the wide hallway from one doorway to another.
There is a babble of voices and the sound of phones
heard off. The McKennas and Drayton are seated on a
long bench, waiting to be called into the inner office
of the Police Inspector. Drayton sits next to Ben.
It is hot. Jo has eyes for everything, but Ben seems
to be somewhat impatient. He looks at his watch for
the third or fourth time in a minute.


INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Drayton notices him studying his watch. He leans to
him, and at the same time wipes off the side of his on
face with a handkerchief.

                      DRAYTON
          Once we talk to the police inspector,
          I'll do my best to out some of the red
          tape.

                      JO
          I have to stretch.

She gets up and saunters away, looking around the police
station for whatever there is to see. Drayton speaks
to Ben with reassuring geniality.

                      DRAYTON
          I'm afraid the questions will go on
          till doomsday, if you admit knew this
          chap Bernard before.

                      BEN
          I didn't know him at all.     We only met
          yesterday on a bus.

                      DRAYTON
          They're a cynical lot, these French --
          they might refuse to believe that.

                      BEN
          They'll have to believe me.     It's true.

                      DRAYTON
          It might sound a bit odd,    from their
          point of view. They saw     the poor chap
          whispering to you ... and    then they
          saw you writing something    down...

Ben looks at Drayton, waiting for his to go on.

                      DRAYTON
          The question is, are you going to show
          them what you wrote down?

Before Ben can say any more, a policeman opens the
door leading to the Police Inspector's office. He
calls out.


INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and
Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench.

The policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police
Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He
is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile.


INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor,
stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton
speaks first.

                      DRAYTON
          Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les
          McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne
          parlent pas francais et ils m'ont
          demandé de traduire.

The Inspector answers in English.

                      INSPECTOR
          Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a
          translator will not be necessary.
              (To McKenna)
          Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame?

He stops aside, and wait.

                      INSPECTOR
              (To Drayton)
          Do to the kindness to wait. I might
          have questions for you later.

He motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first,
into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to
the bench, and watches the trio as the office door
closes on them.

He waves the McKenna to chairs, as he goes around behind
his desk and remains standing. Ben and Jo sit down.
The Inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then
holds out his hand.

                      INSPECTOR
              (Precisely)
          Your passports, please.

Ben looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse.
She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them
to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable,
Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The
inspector checks the pictures against the people he
sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports
down on his desk.

                      INSPECTOR
          You entered French Morocco four days
          ago.

                      BEN
          That's right.

          A surgeon.    A tourist, and an American
          citizen.

                      INSPECTOR
          Three good reasons why you should have
          nothing in common with Louis Bernard.

                      BEN
          I didn't have.

                      INSPECTOR
          You were recently in Paris?

                      BEN
          A medical convention.

                        INSPECTOR
          You come to   Marrakesh with him in the
          same bus.    You drank an apéritif with
          him in your   hotel room. And you ate
          at the same   restaurant last night.

                      JO
          But at different tables.

The Inspector's eyes study her briefly, as if her
comment was an unnecessary interruption. Then his
eyes return to Ben.

                      INSPECTOR
          So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to
          you?

                      BEN
          I met him yesterday -- on the bus --
          for the first time in my life.

The Inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen.

                      INSPECTOR
              (ironically)
          And yet -- out of five  thousand people --
          In a great market place  -- he comes to
          you when he is about to  die! Is that
          the action of a casual  acquaintance,
          monsieur?

                      BEN
              (Obstinate)
          I know nothing about Louis Bernard.

                      INSPECTOR
          No? Not even, I suppose, that he was
          an agent of the Déuxieme Bureau?

                      BEN
          What's that?

                      INSPECTOR
          Perhaps you have also never head of
          the American F.B.I.?
              (Sadly)
          It would be so much more easy for both
          of us, monsieur, if you would cease to
          pretend.

                      BEN
          Now, look here...

                      INSPECTOR
              (Patiently)
          The dead man found out what he had
          been sent here to discover. That is
          why he was kill-ed. He told you what
          he had discovered. Why? Because he
          placed complete confidence in you.
          Voila.

                      BEN
          Boy, you not only ask the questions
          you also answer them -- Wait a minute
          let me ask you a question.

                      INSPECTOR
          Indeed, Monsieur?

                      BEN
          Assuming Bernard trusted me as
          implicitly as you say, I would never
          reveal anything he said to me, would
          I?

                      INSPECTOR
          Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes
          find it desirable to betray a
          confidence?

                      BEN
          Let's get something straight. I'm a
          tourist traveling for pleasure. I
          somehow got involved in an unfortunate
          incident. I came down here to make a
          simple statement of fact, and not to
          be subjected to a police grilling.

                      INSPECTOR
          Monsieur, I would like....

                      BEN
              (Interrupting)
          Now hold your horses!   Just hold them.

The door opens suddenly.   The two men look up.

Ben motions to the policeman to stay where he is

                      BEN
          Wait a minute. A telephone call for
          me?

The policeman at the door looks at the Inspector
briefly. The Inspector is disconcerted, but doesn't
tell the man what to say, so he turns back to Ben and
nods.

The CAMERA PANS Ban as he follows the policeman down
the outside corridor, past Drayton who is still sitting
on a bench and watching Ben somewhat anxiously, and
into a small plain office.


INT. SMALL OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The policeman enters the small office   first. There is
a desk, more like a table, and a phone   is lying on it
off the hook. The policeman picks it    up, and hands it
to Ben. Ben holds it without speaking    a second, and
waves the policeman out.

The policeman is indifferent.    He leaves.   Ben puts
the phone to his ear.

                      BEN

There is an audible click in the receiver held in Ben's
hand.

                         BEN

There is no answer. Ben lowers the phone slightly,
looks at it a minute, then continues on downward with
it, returning the receiver to the phone cradle. He
stands a brief moment in thought, then half turns toward
Drayton sitting in the corridor outside. He motions
to Drayton to join him in the office

                         BEN
          Drayton!

The Englishman gets up and comes into the small office.

                      BEN

Ben picks up the phone, hands it to Drayton.

                      BEN
          Call her. Somebody just threatened me
          about Hank. See if he's all right.

INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

As Ben enters the office, both Jo and the Inspector
look up him inquiringly.

                      JO
          Who was it, Ben?

Ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the
circumstances. He doesn't sit down. He speaks more
to the Inspector than to his wife, avoiding her eyes.

                      BEN
          It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He
          heard we were being held by the Police
          and thought there was some way he could
          help us.

                      JO
          That was nice of him.

                      BEN
              (Looking at Inspector)
          I told him if we weren't back there in
          fifteen minutes to call the American
          Consulate in Casablanca.

The Inspector has realised that he won't get any more
out of Ben.

                      INSPECTOR
              (charmingly)
          But, Monsieur, if you had only told me
          in the first place, that you wished to
          consult with your consul!

Ben gives him a look.

                      BEN
          Let's go, Jo.

                      INSPECTOR
          There is just one small formality. I
          must request you to sign a statement
          of the facts.

                      BEN
          If it doesn't take too long.

                      INSPECTOR
          But a moment. I will send for a typist.

Reluctantly the Inspector reaches for a phone on his
desk. Jo looks at her husband somewhat puzzled.

                        JO
          Ben...

She holds out her hand more firmly.

          I'm your wife, Ben -- not the police
          inspector. Let's see it.

Reluctantly, Ben takes out the notebook, hands it to
her. Ben watches her as she reads the note he has
written.

The notebook page held by Jo on which Ben has scribbled
Louis Bernard's message. It reads: "A MAN...A

from her and replaces it in his pocket. She stares
ahead, with her own thoughts. Then she speaks.

          the American Consulate -- Why get any
          more involved?

Ben is uncomfortable, and unhappy, but he tries to
hide it. He leans toward Jo as if he's about to tell
her something important. He reaches out, places his
hand over hers.

                      BEN

                      BEN
          Jo, hold the call for a minute.

                         JO
          Why?

                      BEN
          Because I asked you to.

She puts the receiver down slowly.    She doesn't like
his manner.

                      JO
          Ben...we're about to have our monthly
          fight.

Ben takes two pills out of a small bottle.      Closes the
bottle, and his medical bag.

                      BEN
          I hope we don't.

                      JO
          Then stop playing Rasputin. I only
          said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.

She reaches for the phone again.    He turns.

                      BEN
          Wait 'til I come back.

She hesitates.   He goes into the bathroom, the CAMERA
PANNING HIM.

She is puzzled with him. Shrugs her shoulders. Slumps
to a sitting position on the bed. She ribs her face
and her eyes with a gesture of fatigue. There is the
sound of running water in the bathroom. When she looks
up again, Ben is standing in front of her. In one
hand he his two capsules, in the other a glass of water.
He holds them out to her. His manner is casual and
pleasant.

                      BEN
          Something to relax you.

She looks at the pills.

                      JO
          I'm so relaxed I'm tired.     You take
          them.

                      BEN
          Jo, they're for you.     I'm the doctor.

                       JO
          Ben...

                      BEN
          You know how you get when things happen --
          tense and upset. Now do me a favor.

She stands up.

                      JO
          Six months ago you told me I took too
          many pills!

                      BEN
          Six months ago you weren't a witness
          to a murder. You've been excited,
          fatigued -- talking a blue streak and
          going around in circles.

                        JO
          I have not.

Ben takes a deep breath.

                      BEN
          Jo, I make my living knowing when and
          how to administer medicine. You'll
          feel a lot better tomorrow if you take
          these today. But you don't think so.
          Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

                      JO
          I'm listening.

                      BEN
          There's something about Louis Bernard,
          the police station, and this whole spy
          business that I haven't told you yet.

He holds out the capsules.

                      BEN
          This is the price of curiosity.

Despite herself she's intrigued.

                      JO
          What could it be?

                      BEN
          There's one way to find out.

She reaches out, takes the capsules, pops them into
her mouth. He hands her the water, she drinks some of
it.

                      JO
          All right, Doctor McKenna.   I am now
          relaxed and listening.


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben moves away from Jo, puts the glass on a dresser.
She sits down on the edge of the bed like a little
girl waiting to hear a bedtime story.

                      JO
          Why don't I call Mrs. Drayton first.
          You can tell me while she's bringing

                      BEN
          Just a minute. This whole thing strange
          right from the very beginning.

As he talks he moves about the room first one way,
then the other, watching Jo closely, almost as if he
were trying to lull her into sleep, or hypnotize her.

                      BEN
          It was no accident that Louis Bernard
          helped us out on the bus, and struck
          up a conversation. You were right
          about him.

                      JO
          See.

                      BEN
          Yes...yes, you were right about him.
          He was...was strange.

Jo is beginning to appear a little drowsy.   Ben watches
her closely.

                      JO
          I know all that.   Get to the surprise.

                      BEN
          He got talking to us because he was on
          the lookout for a suspicious married
          couple.

                      JO
          Nothing suspicious about us.

                      BEN
          He was wrong. It was a different
          married couple.

                      JO
          And he was killed before he found them.

                      BEN
          No. He found them. In the restaurant.
          Last night. That's why he was killed.

                      JO
          You'll be telling me next it was Mr.
          and Mrs. Drayton!

                      BEN
              (Quietly)
          That's just who it was, Jo.

She rubs a hand over her face.   The drug is taking.

                      JO
          If that's a joke, I don't think it's a
          very funny one.

She stops talking. He looks at her more closely.
Then he walks over to her and sits down on the bed
next to her. He looks at her intensely.

                      JO
          Think I'll lie down.

He prevents her.

                      BEN
          Listen to me. And listen carefully.

She comes awake more, studies him.

                      BEN
          That phone call I received at the police
          station.

She nods dumbly.

                      BEN
          It wasn't from the concierge at the
          hotel. It was from somebody with a
          foreign voice who said if I told anybody
          one word of what. Louis Bernard
          whispered to me in the market place
          that something...something might happen
          to...to, to Hank.

She comes suddenly as awake as she can.

                        JO
          Hank?    Why H... ?

                      BEN
          They've taken him away.

She pushes herself to her feet. She is fighting the
drug successfully. She almost shouts at him.

                      JO
          Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the
          hotel. She is downstairs!

He stands up.

                      BEN
          Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never
          came back here! And Hank didn't either!

                      JO
          Well let's start looking for him.    Mr.
          Drayton...Mr. Drayton should...

He takes hold of her arms.

                      BEN
          Jo, Mr. Drayton, checked out of the
          hotel thirty or forty minutes ago!

She knocks his hands away from her arms in a sudden
violent gesture, and all but screams.

                       JO
          Ben!!   I could kill you!   Sedative!

He reaches for her again.    She hits him away.

                      JO
          All this time you, knew Hank was gone,
          and you wouldn't tell me.

                      BEN
          I wasn't sure, until now.

She is fighting the drug which is beginning to take
over again.

                      JO
          He's my child more than yours!    I had
          him.

He takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely,
trying to get away, to hit him, kick him.

                      JO
          Let go of me! I'll never never never
          forget this! We've got to find Hank!
          We've got to find him.

He struggles silently with her, trying to push her
down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its
work.

                      JO
          You think you're the only one strong
          enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I
          hate you, with my whole heart.
              (She starts to cry)
          Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank!
          Get him, Ben. Please. You damn

          anybody...do...


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

He has forced her down on   the bed, pinioning her arms,
even though her legs still   struggle somewhat. She is
having a hard time seeing,   or talking. Her head waves
back and forth. It's hard    work for Ben to hold her.

Her legs grow quiet. Her arm relax somewhat. She is
still straining to move her head, and talk, but all
that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half
moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a
moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down
against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to
cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts
his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss
on the cheek.

                       BEN
              (Softly)
          Darling, if somebody did this to me,
          I'd say just what you said.


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE MOT

Ben stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on
him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and
covers her up. He brushes back the hair from her
forehead. Then he turns, and the CAMERA PANNING HIM
OVER to the door. He takes one last look at Jo, then
goes out the door, closing it softly behind him.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

As the light of sunset fades into growing darkness,
the muezzin stands atop the minaret, arms raised to
the heavens and giving out his high, sing-song call to
prayer. The call is taken up by another voice somewhere
in the city, and then another, and still another --
until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting
starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then
returning.


INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The chant of the call to prayer can be heard In the
background. We are in the single bedroom, of Hank
McKenna. There is one lamp burning over the empty
bed, and another on the wall over the dresser. Ben is
despondently carrying Hank's small suits, and other
articles of clothing from the closet to in open suitcase
on the bed. As he crosses with the final armload of
clothes, he looks out of the door into the large
bedroom.

In the mirror, on the far wall, Ben can see the

to pack them.

Jo opens her eyes and looks about   her. She tries to

INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

We now see Ben's face as he packs his suitcases. Beyond
him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his
direction. He continues to talk, although he finds it
difficult to be matter-of-fact, moving back and forth
from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.

                      BEN
          Both the Draytons are definitely gone.
          The hotel register says they come from
          London. Drayton told the concierge he
          was a college professor. The only
          thing to do now is to get out of
          Marrakesh.

Her face shows a slight rise in reaction, mostly
puzzlement.

                      BEN
          As individuals we're helpless here.
          And because of that phone call, we
          can't bring the police in on it. I
          even thought of taking that chance.

He pauses, and glances at her to see how she reacts.
She just stares at his her eyes a little dull.

                      BEN
          But connect Hank's disappearance to
          Louis Bernard's murder. And the first
          thing they'd do would be to make me
          tell them Louis Bernard's message.
          That...that could be, Hank's...well,
          it wouldn't help him.

Ben goes to take some of Jo's clothes out of drawer,
and comes up with a play script. He looks at it a
moment, then back to Jo. Her eyes observe it, but she
says nothing. Ben continues on to the suitcase, where
he lays the script in with the clothes.

                      BEN
          We're going to London.

She looks a little more sharply as if in question. He
notices as he goes to the dresser for more clothes.

                      BEN
          I found out. The Draytons had a private
          plane -- that's how they took Hank
          back. It could lend anywhere -- no
          question of a passport or anything.

He Packs some more clothes away.   Jo doesn't stir, she
just stares at him.

                      BEN
          So we're going to London to find him.

He looks at her for a reaction. She turns her head
away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting
for control of her emotions. Ben crosses to her, the
CAMERA PANNING him. He sits down on the edge of the
bed, and takes out the small notebook from his coat.
He opens it. In careful, low tones, he reads Louis
Bernard's message.

                      BEN
              (Reading)
          A Man...a statesman...is to be killed...

          Ambrose Chappell...
              (Looks up)
          We're going to try this Ambrose Chappell
          and if he has anything at all to do
          with this, I'm going to offer him every
          cent I've got to got Hank back. This
          Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope.
          Understand, Jo?

Jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece
of paper, and all that it contains. Again she turns
her head away. Slowly Ben puts the paper back into
pocket. He speaks with a shade more urgency in his
voice.

                      BEN
          We've only got a few hours, Jo! We
          have to got up and start moving.

Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to  the dresser
and the suitcases. Then he pauses and   looks back at
Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns   back to look
at Ben. She is studying him now as if   she has just
seen him for the first time. Her eyes   are more alert.
Ben turns back to his packing.

                      BEN
          I've paid the bill, and there's a car
          waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack,
          we're leaving.

Slowly Jo gets off the bed, and comes over to Ben.   He
pauses, articles of clothing in his hands.

For a moment she stands there looking at him, and then
impulsively she throws her arms around him and clings
to him. Her anguish is genuine.

                        JO
            Oh Ben, Ben, Ben...where is he?   Where
            is he?

Ben kisses her on the cheek. She buries her head in
his shoulder. Ben stares off into space as if he hopes
to find in answer to her question.

There is immediate alarm in Jo's face, but she then
controls it.

                       BEN
          Yes?   What is it?

                      EDINGTON
          As things are, there's no need for you
          to go through the Customs. Will you
          come this way!

His tone and manner  of asking them leaves little doubt
that his question is  an order. The McKennas glance at
each other briefly.   They realize that this is a further
development of their  involvement.

                      BEN
          Whatever you say.

                       EDINGTON
              (Smiles)
          This Way, please.

He and the airlines official lead the McKennas toward
another entrance to the Airport Building. As she
follows, Jo seems tense and a little scared.


INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The be-spectacled, pasty-faced woman who had been
standing with the fans before, is now speaking rather
cautiously into a telephone. We don't hear what she
is saying, but the inclination of her head shows that
she is making some reference to the new arrivals.


EXT. AIRPORT BUILDING CORRIDOR - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Another man is waiting for them at a door outside the
airport building.

                      EDINGTON
          This is Mr. Woburn -- Doctor and Mrs.
          McKenna.

                      WOBURN
          How do you do?

                      BEN
          Now what do you people want with us?

                      WOBURN
          Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat
          with you, inside.

                      BEN
          Who is Mr. Buchanan?

                      WOBURN

He gestures them to enter the building. They do,
leaving Edington and tho Airline official outside.


EXT. AIRORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Woburn leads Ben and Jo into an inner office.    It is a
good-sized room, plain, but comfortable.

                      WOBURN
          This is Mr. Buchanan -- Doctor and
          Mrs. McKenna.

                      BUCHANAN
          How do you do?

Ben nods to him without speaking.

                      BUCHANAN
          Thank you, Woburn.

Mr. Woburn quietly exits, closing the door behind him.
The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do.

                      BUCHANAN
          Do sit down, won't you?

Jo hesitates, then sits down.    Ben doesn't.

                      BEN
          Why does Scotland Yard want to talk
          with us?

Buchanan sits down behind the desk.    He's sophisticated
and intelligent.

                      BUCHANAN
          Let me say at once, we're shocked...
          that you son was taken from you in
          Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.


EXT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Jo leans forward quickly, eager, hopeful, unable to
restrain herself.

                      JO
          Do you know where he is?

Ben is somewhat more reserved.

                      BEN
          What about Hank?   What have you heard?

              (O.S.)
          I only wish I could give you some
          cheerful news.

Jo settles back, unhappy, discouraged and a little
resentful of Buchanan. Ben seems irritated by the
disappointment.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Buchanan continues quietly.

                      BUCHANAN
          We might find him. Quite soon, indeed,
          if we work together...Louis Bernard
          was sent to Marrakesh by the French at
          our request to check up on an
          assassination plot -- here, in London.
          A good agent keeps on staking his life.
          He doesn't always win.

Ben and Jo watch Buchanan carefully.

                      BUCHANAN
          Bernard reckoned you were a man to
          trust. He relied on you, to come to
          us.

Jo looks at Ben.   He thinks a moment, but says nothing.

                      BUCHANAN
          Those people kidnapped your boy -- in
          order to keep your mouth shut. That's
          right, isn't it?

                      BEN
          I think they took him for money.

                      BUCHANAN
          Then why didn't you go straight to
          your Consulate in Casablanca? Why did
          you come to London?

Ben is silent.   He can't think of an answer to this
one.

          Jo...


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Buchanan seem only casually obvious of the exchange.
But he has noted it In his mind.

                      BUCHANAN
          You're convinced that these people
          brought your son to London. You're
          convinced you can find him -- off your
          own bat. You can't. It's impossible.
          But with the help we can give you,
          there's a chance. A really good chance.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Before Ben can stop her, Jo bursts in hotly.

                      JO
          They told us not to say anything!


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Buchanan turns to her and speaks gently, but with force.

                      BUCHANAN
          Anything you tell me will be in the
          most absolute confidence.

Ben starts to interrupt.

                      BEN
          That might be true, but --

Buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him.

                      BUCHANAN
              (To Jo)
          Your son is the trump card these people
          hold. He's perfectly safe -- for the
          moment.

                      JO
          And when they've done what they're
          going to do, they'll let him go. So
          all we have to do is wait.

          No, Mrs. McKenna. If they consider
          the boy a nuisance, afterwards -- I'm
          afraid --

He gestures.

                      BEN
          Now, don't try to frighten us, Mr.
          Buchanan.

                      BUCHANAN
          It's exactly what I'm trying to do --
          frighten you. I'm trying to prevent a
          man being murdered here, in London.

The Pressure on Jo is beginning to weaken her.      Buchanan
persists.

                      BUCHANAN
          If you don't tell me all you know, you
          become an accessory before the fact of
          murder. In English law, you become
          just short of murderers yourselves.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Jo, a creature of emotion, is bewildered and upset and
tired of fighting Buchanan. She is ready to give in.
She looks to Ben.

                      JO
          Ben, what can we do by ourselves?    We
          need --

          You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr.

          not my wife.

Buchanan turns to Ben.

                      BUCHANAN
          Then you tell me.

                      BEN
          Bernard spoke in French, and I don't
          understand a word of the language.

There is a pause while Buchanan studies Ben.

          And what did you write down on a piece
          of paper?

Ben stands there.   He has no answer.   Jo gets up from
her seat.

                      JO
          Ben -- maybe they could find those
          people, and Hank, before --

                      BEN

          Maybe. Maybe isn't good enough for
          me, and it shouldn't be good enough
          for you.

                      JO
          You act as if you're the only one who's
          concerned about Hank.

                      BEN
          Now Jo, I didn't mean it that way. We
          made up our minds what we were going
          to do -- now let's try to stick to it.

Ben turns to Buchanan.

                      BEN
          We'd like to cooperate with you, Mr.
          Buchanan -- but -- but we just can't.

                      BUCHANAN
              (quietly)
          I have a son of my own.   I don't know
          what I'd do...

Jo looks at Ben appealingly. Even Ben is uncertain
now, trying to evaluate things quickly,

                      BEN
          Well, maybe if we --

He is interrupted by a tapping at the door. Buchanan
looks up, as do the McKennas. The CAMERA PANS Buchanan
to the door as he opens it himself. His assistant
Woburn is there. There is a whispered conversation.
Woburn retreats, and Buchanan turns back to the room.

                      BUCHANAN
              (Matter-of-factly)
          A phone call for you, Mrs. McKenna.

Buchanan crosses and picks up the telephone from the

Jo steps forward, takes the phone hesitantly, looking
at Bon for reassurance.  He nods to her. Buchanan,
meanwhile, has casually, but quickly gone out of the
office, closing the door behind him.

In the outer office Woburn quickly hands Buchanan the

We hear a voice on filter.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Mrs. McKenna?

                       JO
          Yes.

          This is Mrs. Drayton. You remember
          me?

Buchanan pauses, with nothing to write.

Jo shows some relief, but she's still deeply concerned.

                      MRS. DRAYTON

          wouldn't you?

          Yes.    Please, please!

She looks towards Ben.


INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SH

Ben moves close to her, trying to pick up a little of
the conversation from the phone. She tips the phone a
little in his direction.

          Hello.    Hello, Hank?

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Just a minute.

          I miss you so much.

more. Ben takes the phone from her quickly.

There is a sudden click. Ben rattles the receiver.
All he gets is a dial tone. He hangs up, and turns to
Jo who is quietly crying, trying to get over the shock
of hearing Hank. Buchanan enters the office as Ben
takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him.
He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She
covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears.
She looks up at Ben.

                      JO
          He was scared.

She starts sobbing soundlessly again, her body shaking.
Ben takes her in his arms to quiet her. She quiets
down slowly. Buchanan standing behind the desk doesn't
look at the pair, but he speaks first.

                      BUCHANAN
          It was a London telephone exchange.

nods for Woburn to leave. Woburn does, casting a side
glance of sympathy toward Jo and Ben. He closes the
door quietly behind him.

Buchanan looks at the pair, and sighs in a manner that
suggests he recognizes defeat, when he sees it.

Jo now has herself under control. She leaves Ben's
arms, and returns to her seat to gather herself
together, dry her eyes. Ben turns to Buchanan.

INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and
Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the
frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant
porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through
which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of
assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting
to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with
the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and
windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in
the main room, as the McKennas look about.

                      DESK CLARK
          Everything all right, sir?

                        BEN
          It's fine.    Just fine.

                      DESK CLARK
              (Hands Ben key)
          Your room key, Sir.

Ben takes it. The    porters come out of the  bedroom.
Ben reaches in his   pocket, comes up with a  bill, hands
it to one of them.    The porter touches his  forehead in
sort of a salute.    The porters exit. The   desk clerk
follows, pauses at   the door.

                      DESK CLERK
          And I hope you have a most pleasant
          stay in London.

Both Jo and Ben turn to look at him briefly.     He is
smiling, they are not.

                        BEN
          Oh yes.    Thank you.

The desk clerk goes out the door, carefully closing
it. The McKenna are alone. Jo turns to look at the
basket of flowers, and crosses TOWARD THE CAMERA to
look at them. She takes a card in her hand, attached
to the largest basket, reads the note.

          Especially the little--"
              (She breaks off)

JO stands there a brief moment, takes a breath, and
looks at to otter two cards.

          Cindy and Jan.
              (To Ben)
          You don't know Cindy and Jan.


INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA
PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone
and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and
reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins
flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers
and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his
pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis
Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the
notebook to Jo.

                      BEN
          You'd better keep your book.

He returns to the telephone book, after looking at the
note and placing it on the desk in front of him.

                      JO
          What are you looking for?

                      BEN
          The only clue we have which might lead
          us to Hank. The place and identity of
          Mr. Ambrose Chappell.

He finds what is apparently the right page.    His finger
begins to trace down the list of names.

                      BEN
          There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose
          Chappell.

He returns his eye to the book, as Jo leans closer to
watch him. He begins writing down the name and address,
and murmurs half-aloud as he writes --

                      BEN
          Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett
          Street. Camden Town. Telephone -
          Gulliver 6198.

He reaches for the phone, after putting the book to
one side. He lifts the receiver, but Jo reaches out
to stop him. He looks at her with some annoyance.

                      BEN
          Don't you want me to call him?

                      JO
          I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut
          scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do
          the wrong thing.

                      BEN
              (Quietly)
          I'll try not to be too wrong.

He picks up the phone.

                      JO
          What are you going to say?

                      BEN
          I'll offer to keep my mouth shut and
          give him all the money we have -- for
          Hank.
              (To phone)
          Operator. Get me ...
              (Consults address)
          Gulliver 6198. Thank you.

He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud,
but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump
and turn toward the door, almost frightened.

Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're
in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"

                         JO
          I go.

She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming
with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted.
Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four
people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife.
Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life.

The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music
hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five,
more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan
Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age,
smart-looking, but talkative and slightly
scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell
throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.

                       HELEN
          Jo!   You look wonderful!

Val Parnell follows the women in and closes the door
behind him.

                      VAL
          When we got your wire I couldn't believe
          it. What were you doing down in
          Morocco?

                         JO
          Sightseeing.

                      CINDY
          Two minutes later Helen was on the
          phone to me. And I had to call Jan.

                      JAN
          You're the perfect answer to what London
          needs, Jo. This week's the dullest
          thing since my first show.

Jo has disengaged herself from Helen.     Shakes hands
with Val.

                       JO
          Hello,  Val. Jo and I want to thank
          all of  you for the lovely flowers.
          But you  shouldn't have. We might not
          be here  long!

Ben has been watching them anxiously, torn between
hanging up the phone, or waiting for his call to go
through. The call finally comes through.

                      BEN
          Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell?
          Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I
          will...I

He looks up at the group.     They notice him for the
first time.

                      JAN
          Oh hello, Mr. Conway.     Didn't know you
          were there.

                      VAL
              (To Jan with meaning)
          It's McKenna...Doctor McKenna.      Welcome
          to London Town, doctor.

                      JAN
              (Toward Ben)
          Oh, I am sorry.
              (To Jo)
          I knew you were married, but a doctor.
          How clever! Especially in such a
          psychosomatic business. Why --

                      CINDY
          Will you be quiet!

                      JAN
          Cindy!

                      CINDY
          You don't know what psychosomatic means.

                      JAN
          I do too! It means when your mind
          gets sick of your body it does something
          to it --

                      CINDY
          The doctor's trying to talk on the
          phone.

Ben tries to be casual and amiable.

                      BEN
          It's only business.   It's nothing.

Helen Parnell flops into a chair.

                      HELEN
          Business is everything.     Shhh.

They all fall silent, and watch Ben.    He is
uncomfortable.

                      BEN
          Hello?
              (He tries to keep
               voice down)
          Mr. Ambrose Chappell?
              (forced to be louder)
          I said is this Ambrose Chappell?
          ...Well this Mr. McKenna. Uh,...Doctor
          Benjamin McKenna.

He looks at the listening group uncomfortably.

            Would you like some drinks?

Val Parnell signals silently to her that he can wait
until after the call.

                        BEN
            Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at
            your address for a while? Uh huh,
            it's just some business. Nothing big.
            Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop
            around.


INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Ben hangs up, and turns to the group. He tries to be
as casual as possible. He picks up the note from Louis
Bernard, and the one on which the address of Ambrose
Chappell is written and shoves them into his pocket.
He rises to meet his guests.

                         JAN
            See.   We could have talked.

                         J0
                (Smiles)
            That's what I told you.

                        JO
                (To group)
            I'd like everyone to meet my husband.

Ben volunteers his hand to Val Parnell, while nodding
at Mrs. Parnell.

                        VAL
                (Takes his hand)
            I've heard so much about you, Doctor,
            it's nice to see you in person.

                        HELEN
            You look just like, those pictures Jo
            had in her dressing room four years
            ago. Haven't changed a bit.

                        JAN
            Why should he? He's a doctor.   Probably
            gets free hormones.

Everyone laughs, including Ben and Jo.

                        JO
            And this one is Jan Peterson who sing
            almost as well as I do, but can handle
            those legs like Nijinsky.

                      BEN
          I can believe it.   How do you do, Jan.

                      JAN
          When Nijinsky got off the stage he was
          through with his footwork. That's
          just when mine begins.

Laughter again.

                      JO
          And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful
          expatriate I've ever known.

                      BEN
              (Nods to her)
          Haven't you been home recently?

                      CINDY
          How can I go back to Harrisburg?    They
          know me there as Elva MacDuff
              (Shake's her head,
               pats her wide hips)
          Cindy. It doesn't fit any more.

                      VAL
          Where's your boy? I'd like to see
          which one you he looks like.

All momentary gaiety goes from Jo's face, and Ben has
a hard time appearing nonchalant.

                      BEN
          He -- he's staying with some other
          people -- so we can have a little time
          to ourselves.

                      JAN
          What's his name?

                      JO
              (Tonelessly)
          Hank. Henry, really.

                      CINDY
          I hope he has your looks, and the
          doctor's brains.

Jo turns away toward the flowers.

                      JO
          Thank you again for the beautiful
          flowers.

                      BEN
              (Quickly)
          I'm taking orders for drinks.

He looks around.

          Okay.   But dinner tonight's on me.

Jo turns around to look at him, disturbed, almost to
the point of alarm. A carefree dinner is something
she just couldn't go through.

                      BEN
              (Into phone)
          Room service, please.

                      VAL
          A welcome home for Jo.
              (Smiles at her)
          And I wish I could persuade her to
          stay a month.

                      JO
          Oh, Val -- I wish I could, but...

                       BEN
              (To Val)
          Will you order the stuff?

He starts toward the door, pausing to pat Jo
comfortingly on the shoulder.

                      BEN
          I'll be back in a little while.

                      HELEN
          Aren't you going to wait for a drink,
          doctor.

                      BEN
          Thank you, but I'll catch up when I
          get back.

Ben starts for the door.

                       JO
          Ben!

She goes with him to the door.

Ben opens the door, and Jo follows him half-way into
the corridor. The voices of the others are half-heard
over Jo and Ben's sotto voce conversation.

              (To Cindy)
          Maybe he's tired. Maybe he'd like to

          Jan, how somebody so graceful can have
          such an awkward sense of diplomacy,
          I'll never know.

                       BEN
          You can't.   I won't disappear.   Promise.

In the background, the four visitors, while not actually
eavesdropping, are somewhat subdued by the attitude of
the McKennas toward each other.

                      JO
          Ben, for the last time, please let me
          go.

He pats her affectionately on the cheek.

                      BEN
          Two people are much  easier to follow
          than one. We don't   want Buchanan's
          men on our tracks.   Or the other people,
          either. I'm going   out by the service
          entrance --

He turns and goes quickly. She watches him briefly,
then turns back into the room. She tries to assume a
more pleasant face...

LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight
and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and
disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD
THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from,
his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is
completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so
that his footsteps click on the pavement and create
the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the
echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He
slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA.
There is complete silence -- only the faint distant
London traffic noises.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

He resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING HIM. The
echo starts again. He slows up again and stops -- but
this time the echo continues. He becomes tense, looks
around in alarm.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The CAMERA PANS the streets from Ben's viewpoint.
There is no sign of anyone.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING  him. He
stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo  -- but the
echo comes on after him. Slightly scared,   he now
resumes his walk with a more hurried pace.   The echo
gets louder. He glances quickly over his   shoulder
again.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

A man is following him, at about the same pace.   He is
rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben continues walking, and after a bit cautiously
glances behind him.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The same man is following behind.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks
up trying to locate the right house number as he walks.
The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty-
looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that
he would like to make his destination before the man
following catches up with him. Then he changes his
mind. He deliberately slows up.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the
man approaching behind him, listening with the back of
his head, and with his whole body. The man walking
behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him.

Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist
of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that
he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As
the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him
and study him.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches the   man go on ahead of him at a faster
pace. Suddenly    the man turns a sharp right into
doorway, and is   gone. Ben glances at the paper in his
hand. He stops    and looks up in astonishment.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned.
Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE
CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben hesitates briefly in thought, puts the piece of
paper into his pocket, then makes up his mind and goes
through the doorway.


EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Ben, rather cautiously, makes his  way  across a small
and somewhat dreary-looking yard,  and  comes to face a
low building at the end of which  is a  kind of small
factory. The door of the factory   is  just closing as
he makes his way across.


EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben pauses at the door to the factory, and looks down
at the pushbutton bell. There is a window next to the
door. Ben bends and peers through the window.


EXT. FACTORY WINDOW - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Staring through the other side of the window is the
snarling, realistic head of a tiger.


EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Startled, Ben recoils instinctively. Then he turns
back to the door, takes a deep breath, braces himself,
and presses the doorbell. The door is soon opened by
a young workman in shirtsleeves and apron.

He opens the door, and Ben enters.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben follows the workman into the shop. It is cluttered
with stuffed animals of every size and shape imaginable.
Lions, tigers, elephant heads, swordfish, crocodiles --
everything. Ben stares around at what he sees. A
number of workmen are busy mounting, stuffing, and
preparing animals for display. The workmen who let
him in calls to someone.

                      WORKMAN
          A sent to see you, sir.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A man, about eighty years old, turns from inspecting a
piece of work, and comes forward to Ben. He is a thin,
gracious, gentle sort of creature.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          Good afternoon, Sir. I am Ambrose
          Chappell.

Ben studies the man briefly. His face shows disbelief
that such a man could be put of an assassination plot.
Chappell stops in front of him, waits a brief moment.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          What can I do for you?

                      BEN
          Well you see, I uh...

There is a twinkle in the old man's eye.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          You gave me your name that might be a
          start.

                      BEN
          Oh, of course, McKenna.    Doctor Benjamin

          Certainly. It happens all the time.
          You expected someone else -- Just a
          moment.

               out)
          Ambrose!


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

From behind a doorway on the   far side a man emerge s
in response to the call. He    is somewhat younger than
the first Ambrose Chappell,   but not by much. He is
the fifty-year-old gentleman   who had been apparently
following Ben on the street.    The CAMERA PANS him over
following to his father, and   Ben.

                      CHAPPELL SR.
          I think this gentleman wants to talk
          to us.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Now, father. Now why don't you go and
          have a nice rest?

                        CHAPPELL SR.
          Humph!    I have centuries of rest ahead
          of me.

                      (Nods to Ben)
          Good day to you, sir.

Ben nods in return, and the elder Chappell returns to
whatever he was doing when Ben entered.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Now what can I do for you?

Ben turns his attention back to the son.    He is now a
little more in command of himself.

                      BEN
          I'm Doctor Mckenna.
              (He waits, no
               reaction)
          Does the name mean anything to you?

Chappell Jr. thinks for a moment.    The name obviously
doesn't register.

                      CHAPPELL
          I don't think so.

A widor angle of the shop. Workmen pause in their

curiosity.

Chappell Jr. nods his head, but waits with a deadpan
expression for Ben to continue. After a pause, Ben
does.

                      BEN
          You have no idea why I came here?

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          My dear sir, I haven't the faintest
          idea!

Ben's expression shows that he feels Chappell is putting
up a thorough bluff, but he still goes on.

                      BEN
          I was given your name by someone I
          happened to meet in Marrakesh.

Chappel Jr.'s expression doesn't change, except for a
slightly raised eyebrow.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Oh, yes?

Ben now has the feeling he's on to the right man.

                      BEN
          I suppose you've heard of him.    Louis
          Bernard. A Frenchman.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Louis Bernard?

He seems to be turning the name over in his mind.    Ben
turns to at the workmen around them.

The workmen half-listening, return to their work on
the various animals. They are a bit self-conscious at
being observed eavesdropping.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben turns back to Chappell Jr. He moves in a little
closer, and drops his voice somewhat. Chappell Jr.
watches him warily.

                      BEN
          Let's stop fencing with words, huh?
          Bernard told me to come here, just
          before he died.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          This man is...dead?

                      BEN
          You know it as well as I do. Now I
          came to make a business proposition.
          And I don't see how you can turn it
          down.

Ambrose Chappell looks over to a man stuffing animal's
corpse.

                      CHAPPEEL JR.
          What did you have in mind?

                      BEN
          You want to talk here?

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Certainly. We have no secrets from
          our employees.

                      BEN
          Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered
          one word of what Bernard told to before
          he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm
          not interested in political intrigue,
          and I don't care who it is you're going
          to kill here in London. All I want is
          that boy, and I'll get on the first
          plane for America.

When Ben begins mentioning a killing, Chappell Jr's
face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. He moves
back from Ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. Ben,
however, now convinced that he has the right man in
front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.

                      BEN
          Now that isn't all.   If money will do
          anything...

Chappell Jr. now seems thoroughly frightened. He moves

to the door of a small office, in which is now standing
Chappell Sr.

Chappell Sr. leans closer to the open door, as the son
speaks urgently and sotto Voce to him.

Chappell Jr. now turns back toward Ben, trying to assume
a pleasant and casual manner.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Now, sir -- shall we go into this a
          little more carefully? You said
          something about money?

Workmen are pausing in their work to look at the pair,
wondering at the mention of money.

                      BEN
          You told him to call the police.   Now
          don't try to bluff me like that!

He reaches out quickly, grabs Chappell jr. by the label.
The man gives an involuntary cry of fear.

          at once?
               (Glancing toward

          I've never heard of him.

                      BEN
          And you don't have any idea what went
          on in Marrakesh yesterday, or where my

          No, of course not! Edgar!   William!
          Davis! Help!

Ben lets go of Chappell Jr., and turns in confusion.


INT. TAXIDERMY SHOP - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The workmen drop their tools, and move in on Ben quickly
and threateningly. Even Chappell Sr. comes out of the
office in alarm. Ben backs away toward the door.

                      BEN
          Now just a minute. Take it easy. I
          obviously got the wrong place. Now
          stay away from me.

But they don't. They come on. Ben looks quickly around
for a weapon, or an exit. He sees the door, and moves
quickly toward it, but the workmen are faster than he
is. Two of them bar the exit. Ben tries to shove
them out of the way and get through the door. The men
grapple with him. Chappell Jr., himself, and another
workman rush in, endeavoring to subdue Ben. A silent,
but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete
melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold
him down.

                      CHAPPELL JR.
          Hold him...hold him...till the police
          come.

Ben breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another
escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past.
But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They
twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted
animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish,
and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in
his struggles comes face to face with the angry head
of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself
at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object
somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches
himself free.

up his fallen hat and dashes out again.


INT. SAVOY SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting
around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She
seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val
Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her
disinterest.

                      VAL
          ...and back at our flat, after the
          first night, Chris had the nerve to
          suggest that the sketch where Bud
          Flanagan comes in dressed up as the
          Countess was unconvincing ... that no
          matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan
          was, even if he were dressed by
          Hartnell, nobody would believe he was
          an aristocrat. So I said, 'Look Chris,
          why don't you cut William Hickey's
          column out of the paper?! --

He stops talking, as he looks across at the silent Jo.
Helen and the others, follow his look. They watch her
sympathetically. Jo  seems totally unaware that anyone
else is in the room, staring, into thin air, absorbed
with thoughts of her own.

                         VAL
              (Softly)
          Jo. Jo.

          husband of yours?
              (Consults his watch)
          He's been gone over an hour.

She doesn't answer, so he goes on.

          No.   No...you mean Chappell!

She rises from her chair with some excitement.    She
murmurs, almost to herself:

crosses to a table, takes her purse. She hurries to
the door without a word; then turns to them.

She hurries out the door. The others are left standing,
looking at each other. Val and Helen speak almost at
the same time, asking each other the same question.

Val paces thoughtfully, and they watch him.

                      VAL
          It must be a now American gag.    I'll
          ask Danny about it.

At that moment the door suddenly opens. Everyone turns
in surprise. Ben is standing in the doorway. He comes
slowly into the room, closing the door. He is very
tired looking, and disheveled. They watch him enter
silently.

Val walks over to him, hands him a ready-made drink.
Ben takes it but doesn't have time to drink when Val
speaks.

Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes

young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the
woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the
autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with
the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has
caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious
satisfaction jumps three of her men.

          Look it doesn't hurt to be kind. Yell
          out when you want me to open the door.

Edna studies the board with a frown.   Mrs. Drayton
smiles and goes out the door.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

In the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door,
and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She
enters another door.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA
PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting
on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the
McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for
someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and
tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped
underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word,
sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with
something close to fatigue. Then she speaks.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          I wish it was tomorrow.

Drayton turns, having finished his dressing.

                       DRAYTON
              (Coldly)
          That's not a very orthodox sentiment.

He goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer.
It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the
gun.

                       DRAYTON
          Two excellent tickets for the concert
          at the Albert Hall -- with my
          compliments.

He hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances
at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket.

                      DRAYTON
          Your box is nicely placed, or shall we
          say strategically placed.

He goes to a portable record player, which is open and
has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph.

                      DRAYTON
          Now for the most important part.

He gestured towards the record.

                        RIEN
          What is it?

                      DRAYTON
          A record of the delightful Picco they
          will play tonight.

                      RIEN
          What about it?

                      DRAYTON
          Music is less in your line than
          marksmanship. If you will listen, my
          friend, I will play for you the exact
          moment at which you can shoot. Now
          listen carefully.

Drayton plays the record.

                      DRAYTON
          Let me do it for you again.   Now listen
          for the cymbal crash.

Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands
together at the cymbal crash.

                      DRAYTON
          You see at such a moment your shot
          will not be heard. The listeners will
          not even be disturbed. I think the
          composer would have appreciated that.
          No one will know.

                      RIEN
          None except one you mean.

The assassin smiles.

                      DRAYTON
          Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend.
          Any questions musical or otherwise?

                        RIEN
          No.

                      DRAYTON
          There's's one comforting thought. It
          happens early in the evening. I hope
          I won't upset you if I say there's
          time for one shot only. If you need
          another, the risk is yours.

                      RIEN
          I do not take risks.

                      DRAYTON
          That's a comfort -- traipsing all the
          way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I
          should like you to do me credit.

He looks at his watch.

                      DRAYTON
          Your distinguished target's on the way
          there now. A car is waiting for you
          downstairs at the back entrance. You
          will pick up a Miss Benson on your
          way. She will be your companion in
          the box. She's there to lend an air
          of respectability...if that's possible.

                      RIEN
          You will have the money when I return?

                      DRAYTON
          I think you can trust me.

                      RIEN
              (Looking him up and
               down)
          What is your English proverb -- a wolf
          in Sheep's clothing?

Drayton laughs.

                         DRAYTON
          I think you    had better be going. It
          is impolite    to be late for a concert.
          It would be    awkward if they made you
          wait until    the first selection is over.

He turns to his wife.

                      DRAYTON
          See him downstairs, my dear.
              (To Rien)
          I'm sorry you must sneak out the back
          way, but we have to preserve our
          respectable front.

She exits with the assassin.    Drayton turns to the
mirror and surveys himself.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. REAR ENTRANCE AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY)

In the distance Jo is seen pacing. To rear door of
the chapel opens and Mrs. Drayton pushes Rien out. He
crosses and enters a waiting car. The car drives off.

EXT. AMBROSE STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

The shadows of the day are lengthening as Ben gets out
of a taxi and approaches Jo standing on the sidewalk.
His fatigue of before seems to have vanished in his
eagerness to meet Jo and find out what she knows.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben comes up to her.   She grips his hands.

                         JO
          There it is.

                      BEN
          You may have just hit it right on the
          nose. You can't be farther wrong than
          I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let's
          go.

                      JO
          Ben, should we get some help from the
          police?

                      BEN
          No, honey, please, no -- let's take a
          crack at this alone.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

The Chapel as seen from their viewpoint. People are
now entering it, but it seem as if the tag end of the
congregation is entering, because the service is
obviously under way, the sound of hymn singing coming
across faintly to us.


EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately.
Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING
them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM   SHOT

They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around
cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds
about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist
type and the congregation consists mostly of middle-
aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not
aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other
than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport,
and later took care of Hank.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row
seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to
look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something
to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks
up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and
begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of
following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own
words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at
the chapel.

                      BEN
              (singing)
          This looks like mother wild goose chase.

                      JO
              (Singing them)
          Let's wait and look around...

Some of the parishioners turn and listen to Jo's voice
because it has a professional quality that rises above
the rest. Whether they are watching her in suspicion,
or admiration, is hard to tell. Jo turns her attention
to the hymn book, trying to be unnoticed. Ben's eyes
catch something coming down the aisle.

                      BEN
              (Singing)
          Look who's coming down the aisle.

Jo follows his glance, leaning forward a little and to
one side.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

Coming up the aisle with a collection basket, collecting
money during the hymn is Mrs. Drayton. She is
approaching the row in which the McKennas are standing.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is
between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben
immediately eases his way along behind a column which
hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the
side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall
woman in front of her, but she is not entirely
successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to
them.

Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs.
Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes
forward her collection plate, and as she does so her
face blanches. She instantly identifies the two.
Ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the
eye and puts some coins into her plate.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As the astonished Mrs. Drayton turns to go back down
the aisle with her plate of coins and bills, we now
see the surpliced Mr. Drayton ascending the pulpit.
He looks down to his wife.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT

From Mr. Drayton's viewpoint, as he notices his wife
coming up the aisle with a startled expression on her
face. She tries to  nod with her head to indicate
something important lies behind her.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Mr. Drayton, trying to puzzle out her alarm, studies
her face, and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her.
The expression on his face leaves no doubt that he
cannot understand what she's trying to convey. The
hymn has come an end, and the congregation starts
seating itself.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as
yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front
of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his
pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right
one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls
silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his
sermon.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain
page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is
sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at
him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the
pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something
out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and
begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.

                       DRAYTON
          Brothers and Sisters: The subject of
          my address this evening is adversity.
          The average life, yours and mine, is
          often harassed and perplexed by
          cruelties and disappointments beyond
          our control.

Strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our
control which help to make us better beings.

Pain and tribulation are the testing ground of   life
and let us be grateful for them. Let us bless    the
disappointments and the frustrations and say a   prayer
for the agony of the moment. Only thus shall    we confirm
and re-confirm our own goodness and therefore   the
essential goodness of all Mankind.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon.
Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered.

                      BEN
          That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on
          out and call him and ask him to surround
          the place with police.

                      JO
          What if he asks me...

                      BEN
          Tell him...tell him everything. This
          is the time. I'm sure Hank is around
          here some place.

                      JO
          Ben, I don't want to leave you.

                      BEN
          I don't know how else to do it, honey.

Ben gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at
him, she slides out of the seat.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

In the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He
almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her
seat.

The chapel as seen from Drayton's viewpoint. Jo has
turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious.
Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon,
shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph.

                      DRAYTON
          Few of us pause to think how life's
          adversities work in our behalf, to
          make better men and women of us.

                      DRAYTON (CONT'D)
          But I believe we should pause now to
          do a little stock-taking -- to look
          into our own hearts and see what we
          find there. Therefore instead of
          continuing the service, I think we
          should all return to our homes for
          private meditation, remembering how
          little we have to complain of and how
          much to be grateful for. Next week I
          shall discuss the fruits of our
          meditation. Until then, my blessing
          upon each and every one of you.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart.
There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells
them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from
the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The
members rise from their seats and begin filing out of
the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances
toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have
heard.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he
beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers
something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to
him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton
goes off through a side door by the altar, while the
organist makes her way down the aisle through the
congregation to stand by the door.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through
the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the
front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow
and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel,
Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets
him with bland amiability.

                      DRAYTON
          Well this is a pleasant surprise,
          Doctor.

                      BEN
          Where's my boy, Drayton?

                      DRAYTON
          He's upstairs. As a matter of fact
          you've just come in time to help my
          wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank
          doesn't care much for English cooking.

Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he
talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows
it cautiously. But before he can confirm his
suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing
that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has
just closed the door, and is in the process of locking
the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts
the key and puts it into her pocket.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has
changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat
of his robes.

                      BEN
          What do you want? I'll give you money
          and keep my mouth shut. All I want is
          my boy.

                      DRAYTON
          And what about your wife? Did she go
          outside just to get some fresh air.

                      BEN
          Tell me what you want.   I'll do
          anything.

                      DRAYTON
          All right -- you'll see your boy in
          good time.

With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from
Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses
it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens
and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly
to face them, backing of a little.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and
the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves.
Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind
them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and
suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone
can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the
microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon.
He yells into it.

                     BEN
          Hank! Hank McKenna!    Hank!   Where are
          you? Hank! Hank!

As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash
for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly
off, the voice of Hank:

                       HANK
          Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad -

His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit
in an effort to make for the open door, but the two
men throw themselves on top of him.

Woburn, assistant to Buchanan, is listening intently

          He sent me out to call you -- so we
          could do something before they get

          I don't know, I don't know where he
          is...but at least these people will
          know -- the Draytons. If you'd only
          send somebody to get them.

           return to your husband, tell him to

           let the police take over.

He turns to the other phone.

          Yes, but something's wrong. A few
          minutes ago the place was full of
          people, and now there's nobody!

Two of the police move up toward the Chapel.    Patterson
glances at it.

                      PATTERSON
          Our orders are to keep it under
          observation until a Scotland Yard car
          arrives.

                      JO
          My husband's in there. There must
          have been thirty or forty people...
          and now...

Patterson looks at her carefully.

                      PATTERSON
          When was this?

                      JO
          It couldn't...it couldn't have been
          more than five minutes ago!

                      PATTERSON
              (Interrupting)
          Let's take a look.

          I tried that. It's looked, Let's force
          it open.

                      PATTERSON
          I'm sorry, madam, we can't break in.
              (Sympathetic)
          Requires a search warrant. It's the
          law, you see.

                      JO
          Couldn't you get one?

                      PATTERSON

                      PATTERSON
          Are you quite certain the place was
          full of people -- only a few minutes
          ago?

                      JO
          Of course I'm certain. I was there
          myself, sitting next to my husband.
          He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.

He looks at her quizzically.

                      J0
          It's much too complicated to explain.

                      PATTERSON
          We'll just have to sit tight and wait
          for the car to arrive from the Yard.

unhappily, is forced to follow.

He begins to stir a little as if just beginning to

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The policemen are grouped around the patrol car, as
Patterson, the sergeant, talks over a radio telephone.

                      PATTERSON
          So far as we can make out, sir, there's
          no sign of life. I see, very good,
          Sir.

He hangs up, and gets out of the open car.    He turns
to one of his men.

                      PATTERSON
          Walden, you'll stay here, till the car
          arrives from the Yard.

Jo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a
moment and makes a sudden decision.

                      JO
          Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.

Patterson looks at her with tolerant surprise.

                      PATTERSON
          Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our
          beat. Suppose we drop you at the
          nearest taxi rank?

Jo looks back at the Chapel briefly.

                       JO
          All right.   Let's go.

EXT. EMBASSY - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

The exterior rear of a huge residential building such
as is to be found in Kensington Palace Gardens or
Belgrave Square. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see a
Humber car driving through the gates at the rear. It
pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside
the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are
the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry
to the door of the kitchen and enter.


INT. EMBASSY KITCHEN - (DAY) - MED. SHOT

There is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of
middle-age, all preparing food for what is obviously a
big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to
get their attention.

                       GUARD
          Hello.   Hello.

The work falls quiet as they become aware of him.

          Everybody out into the corridor.   Hurry
              (He claps his hands)

There is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The
man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers
some words to him. The butler turns to the workers
and starts herding them toward the corridor through a
door in the far corner of the kitchen.

                      BUTLER
          Do what he says. Come on. It will
          only be a minute. Come on, all of you --
          out.

The man goes to the door.

          queer going on.


INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT

While the other servants are grumbling, one is saying
nothing. He rather a Shrewd-looking young footman.
He strains to listen through closed door. Coming from
the kitchen are several sounds. A door opening, the
walking of feet, and finally the slam of a door.

                      ANOTHER VOICE
          Bringing people in, in secret...

                      ANOTHER VOICE
          Give me the Swiss Embassy every time,

Then the sound of a car leaving outside. The door to
the kitchen opens and the servants, including the young
footman enter again.

The young footman, among the first to enter, surveys
the kitchen. There is no sign of anyone having passed
through.


EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT

The street before the chapel is still deserted, and
the light of day is beginning to fade. Suddenly the
silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing
spasmodically in the chapel belfry. Along the street
a few people begin putting their heads out of windows,
and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying
away down the street.


INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Inside the chapel we can see the cause of the spasmodic
bell ringing. Ben is using  the rope to climb out of

Shooting through the Albert Memorial as a foreground
piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big
concert. Through the archway large limousines are
pulling up, while on the sidewalk level with the main
road odd taxis are pulling in. We see the usual line
of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.


EXT. ALBERT HALL - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces
for that evening the commemorative concert. Further
details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be
sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal
Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo
soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the
CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near
enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the
door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far
side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note.
She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after
her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks
at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner
recesses of his clothes.

South American beauties.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - LONG SHOT

Shooting down from the stone-stepped, cast-iron
railinged staircase we see the milling people going
off in different directions to their seats. There is
a hubbub of voices through which we can hear the
programme sellers crying out their wares.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people,
perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other
people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time
because they had no money, take their turns at the
window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this
queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the
queue.

Shooting over the head of crowd she sees the arrival
of an important personage. He is accompanied by others
who are apparently attendants upon him. A couple of
the individuals behind him are wearing large order

is in white tie and tails, and also wearing a number
of foreign orders. About third is line behind him
comes 'Buchanan'.

cow-towing behind him, and alongside of the manager
someone dressed like he might be 'Sir Kenneth Clarke',
the head of the Arts Council, The new-arrival is
greeted. There is an exchange of courtesies, after
which they are led on toward the beginning of the
staircase. As 'Buchanan' comes nearer.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Jo tries to push her way through towards him. The
people around her resent her efforts. Behind Jo are
two girls in their early twenties. Both are Chelsea
types.

              (Bored)

The CAMERA PANS Jo as she does manage to get forward a
little, but she is caught up in the Sudden break-up of
the people who have lined up to see arrival. By the
time she is in the clear the CAMERA PANS her further
and over her shoulder we see the last of 'Buchanan'
and the rest up the staircase, followed by other members
of the audience going up in the same direction.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - CLOSE UP

We see Jo's frustration filling her face. She begins
to turn her head. She looks down with indecision.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

In the foreground are passing people hurrying towards
their seats. There, taking a step forward and staring
in Jo's direction, is Rien, the Assassin. His face
shows considerable alarm at what he sees.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - MEDIUM. SHOT

From his viewpoint Jo is   half-turned in his direction.
Her head is still down.    Slowly she looks up. Her
mouth half-opens when she   sees the man she once saw in
the corridor of the hotel   at Marrakesh.


INT. LOBBY - (DAY) - SEMI-CLOSE UP

Rien, with a quick thought, hurries over to her.

He turns to go.   Jo clutches him and almost cries out.

the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled
by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we
can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed
by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which
obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary
in his box.

Jo stares toward the opening into the hall. She seems

          If you don't mind, I'm just looking

eyes and studies his target.


INT. HALL - (DAY) - CLOSEUP

Jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitary's box.
He is turning to the man beside him, whom we shall
later know as the Ambassador, and indicates with
gestures how much he is enjoying the concert. He looks
back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and
comments to 'Buchanan'. Then, turning forward, he
settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - LONG SHOT

Through the doors we see a taxi pulling away and
presently a glass door opens and a dishevelled Ben
comes into the lobby. He comes up to the CAMERA and
looks about him.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT

From his viewpoint the lobby appears empty except
perhaps for a solitary uniformed policeman.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben look the other way and upstairs.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint the other direction -- just
emptiness.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - CLOSEUP

We see Ben's bewilderment as to what to do and where
to go. We PAN him up to the first corridor entrance
that leads to the main circular corridor. Ben enters.
His face lights up.


INT. CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From his viewpoint we see through the opening the ticket
collector and the program girl standing at the opening
leading down the main aisle. On the right, standing
with her back to him, is Jo.

INT. HALL - (DUSK) - MEDIUM SHOT

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he hurries forward. He touches
Jo lightly on the shoulder. She turns, startled, and
manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him. We
do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime
we see that Jo is telling Ben all about the impending
shooting. Ben argues with her. He indicates he will
tell Buchanan. She frantically restrains him but he
shakes her off and dashes away.


INT. LOBBY - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see Ben ascending the stairs originally taken by
the dignitary and his group.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben comes into the corridor and looks about him. Beyond
him we see a group of men obviously detectives, and
ahead of them a police constable. We see Ben hurry in
his direction.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (DUSK) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

Ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him
when he is stopped. We again do not hear the dialogue,
but the pantomime shows that Ben is trying to get to
Buchanan. The constable doesn't quite know what to
make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he
must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as
the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who
is standing in a small group a little way off. From
his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the
Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's
direction.


INT. HALL - (DUSK) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Jo, looking over her shoulder and then up to the box
of the dignitary. She turns desperately towards the

side. Again in pantomime the Inspector questioning
the impatient Ben. He leaves Ben and goes over to the
men standing outside the door to the box. Ben half-

Ben is still waiting for the Inspector to discuss
matters with the plainclothesman. He turns and hurries
away, the CAMERA PANNING him.

In the orchestra, the cymbal player now places one
hand on the cymbals on the chair.


INT. HALL - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

In the box the Assassin places his hand for the   first

recesses of the box.

The Assassin now has his gun out in the darkness of
the rear of the box.

hand page showing the one note he is to strike.

There is utter confusion in the lobby, police dashing
upstairs on either side.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

We see Ben hurrying down the stairs. Jo rushes into
the lobby and, seeing Ben, dashes towards him.

 Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 134.



A few of the people around the lobby begin to look at
Jo and Ben. We see the Assistant Manager hurry over
to them. They are in a group of three, and although
we do not actually hear what he says, due to the hubbub,
he is obviously questioning Ben and being solicitous
to Jo.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the
conversation. Ben is just saying:

                      BEN
          Then he didn't kill him?

                      ASSISTANT MANAGER
          Your wife saved him -- it is only a
          small flesh wound...Oh here he is
          now...you must come and meet him...don't
          be nervous...I'll get the aide to
          present you...it will be all right
              (To Woburn)
          Would you present the lady to the prime
          minister?

Suddenly their attention is drawn to something off-
screen up the stairs. The hubbub increases.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister,
obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate,
being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other
members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special
Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and
obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating
their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather
over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the
stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.


INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

'Buchanan' is reassuring the Ambassador.

                      BUCHANAN
          I'll report to you fully at the Embassy,
          Your Excellency. In the meantime...


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The manager is leading Ben and Jo across to the foot
of the stairs. They are reluctant but he insists. As
the CAMERA PANS them over they meet the group at the
bottom at the stairs. The manager calls out to Mr.
Woburn and indicates Ben and Jo.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - CLOSEUP

Woburn is a little non-plussed.  He leans over to one
of the Prime Minister's Aides.  The latter's face lights
up. He leans over and whispers  something to the Prime
Minister. The Prime Minister is  all smiles.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Woburn steps down and introduces Ben and Jo to the
Prime Minister's Aide.

                      WOBURN
          Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady
          who --

The Prime Minister interrupts enthusiastically.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          My dear lady, I shall be for ever in
          your debt.

                      WOBURN
          And this is her husband --

The Prime Minister interrupts again, less
enthusiastically.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          A pleasure, my dear sir...
              (He turns to Jo)
          I trust you will permit me to wait
          upon you tomorrow and to express the
          depth of my gratitude.

                       JO
              (Weakly)
          It wasn't -- it wasn't --

                      PRIME MINISTER
              (Gallantly)
          Oh but it was, my dear lady.

There is an awkward pause.  The Prime Minister collects
himself and turns to move on out of the hall, the police
making a passageway for him through the crowd. We see
the Ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving
across the screen quickly to follow the Prime Minister.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

Ben and Jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do
or where to go next. Woburn standing with Ben and Jo.

          talk to you.


INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT) - SEMI-LONG SHOT

From their viewpoint a grim 'Buchanan' is standing at
the top of the stairs.


INT. LOBBY STAIRS - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

The CAMERA PANS Ben and Jo up the stairs towards
'Buchanan'. They increase their pace towards him.


INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - (NIGHT) - SEMI-CLOSEUP

When they reach him they have only one thought in their
minds to ask him.

                       JO
              (Wildly)
          Where's our boy?   Where's Hank?

                      BUCHANAN
              (quietly)
          We can talk if you'll come in here.

The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and
to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various
police standing about and some of Special Branch men
can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside
too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in.
The door closes behind them.


INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The three of them enter the 'Green Room', generally
used by the principal Artistes appearing at Royal Albert
Hall. Buchanan nods to two Special Branch men who are
standing about in case they are needed. The room is
informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of
small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest
chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in
a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he
expects him to say something. Ben responds to the
look.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Coldly)
          So you both know the time and place
          all along.

                      BEN
              (Roughly)
          Don't be a fool.

                      BUCHANAN
          An odd coincidence -- both of you
          turning up here.

                       BEN
              (Coldly)
          Too bad you didn't contact your
          assistant. He sent us both here.

                      BUCHANAN
              (Quickly)
          I beg your pardon.

                      BEN
          You see, we finally needed that help
          you offered. We still need it.

                      JO
              (Urgently)
          Yes, Mr. Buchanan.     We still need it.

The door opens and another member of the Special Branch
enters.

                      DETECTIVE
          Sir?

Buchanan nods to him to speak.

                      DETECTIVE
          We've questioned the woman. Said she
          bought a ticket that happened to place
          her in the same box with the man that
          did the shooting. Doesn't know anything --
          but if she does, she's not talking.

                      BUCHANAN
          I'll see her later.

                      DETECTIVE
          Very good, sir.

The Detective exits as Ben sits down dejectedly in a
chair.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Gently)
          Please tell me everything, now.
          Everything.
              (go turns to Jo)
          There's still plenty of room for hope,
          Mrs. McKenna...

ballroom.

As yet the room is about quarter filled and various
guests of the Diplomatic Corps and others are gradually
adding to the group. The CAMERA DOLLIES DOWN over
them until it reaches slightly open doorway. Peering
cautiously through we see the face of Drayton.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

On the other side of the doorway is Drayton and his
wife. She is pacing nervously behind him. A footman
comes up to them and announces:

                         FOOTMAN
             His Excellency will see you now.

Drayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them
after the footman across a small hallway. He is the
very same footman we saw among the group of servants
who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door
in front of the Draytons -- they enter.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an
oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador
whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.

                         AMBASSADOR
             Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman
             won't talk, she won't talk and that's
             that, I suppose. All right.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton
advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner,
the CAMERA PANNING him.

                          DRAYTON
                 (Easily)
             Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain
             to you -- something very unusual has
             happened. I must also have the money
             to pay our French marksman.

                         AMBASSADOR
                 (Almost casually)
             Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering
             that he's dead?

Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador.
They are staggered at this news.

                      AMBASSADOR
          His aim wasn't quite as good as you
          led me to expect. The target merely
          received a slight flesh wound in the
          arm. Worse than useless.

Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.

                      AMBASSADOR
          Then your French friend panicked, and
          made a fatal crash -- landing on the
          floor of the Albert Hall.

                       DRAYTON
              (Blustering weakly)
          I don't see how you can hold me
          responsible. He was most warmly
          recommended by our people in
          Marrakesh...

The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.

                      AMBASSADOR
          I'm glad you're able to treat the matter
          so lightly. I am holding a reception
          here this evening. In a few minutes,
          I have to welcome our Prime Minister
          as my guest of honor -- when I hope
          and expected that he would be totally
          unable to attend. That amuses you, no
          doubt?

                       DRAYTON
              (Feebly)
          I don't know what to say ...

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Brutally)
          No. But I do. You've muddled
          everything from the start. Kidnapping
          that child in Marrakesh...Don't you
          realize that Americans dislike having
          their children kidnapped?

                       DRAYTON
              (Trying to keep his
               end up)
          How else could I make sure the American
          would hold his tongue?

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Ignoring this)
          And then, to crown it all, you get
          cold feet and come running along here
          to hide -- and bring the child with
          you: Don't you see what you've done to
          the diplomatic status of this Embassy?

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Staccato)
          How are you going to get the child out

               self-confidence)
          There's no difficulty about that,

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Interrupting)
          With plain-clothes detectives planted
          right round this building?
              (Wryly)
          You English intellectuals will be the
          death of us all.

                      DRAYTON
              (Desperate)
          I'll think of some method.   Just give
          me time....

                       AMBASSADOR
              (He snorts
                Contemptuously)
          Time!

The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage,
and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking
about something.

                      AMBASSADOR
          I want the child removed from this
          Embassy, and removed in such a way
          that he won't be able to say any more
          where he has been tonight.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Oh, no!

The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a
manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say
something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth.
Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible
servility.

                      DRAYTON
          Right, I'll see to it..

Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There
is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

                           AMBASSADOR
          Come in.

The door opens and a butler enters.

                      BUTLER
          Your Excellency, the Princess should
          be arriving at any moment.

The Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a
little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the
room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra
in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The
Ambassador goes out of the door.        Mrs. Drayton is
looking down at the floor.


INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Ben is talking.    Buchanan is listening carefully.

                      BEN
          ...recognized him, and he recognized
          me. So he jumped for it. And that is
          all.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Slowly)
          Trying to liquidate one of their own
          big-shots. I wish they'd stick to
          their usual custom, and do it in their
          own country...

At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re-
placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks
up the telephone.

                       WOBURN
          Hello.
              (He listens for a
               moment)
          Hold on.

He turns the telephone over to Buchanan.

                      BUCHANAN
              (To phone)
          Buchanan speaking.

Buchanan listens for a while, his face changing as he
listens with increased interest.

                           BUCHANAN
          Right.    Bye.

Buchanan hangs up, turns to Woburn, but half speaks in
the direction of the McKenna's.

                      BUCHANAN
          The Draytons are at the Embassy.

                      JO
          How do you know?

                      BUCHANAN
          We have ways of finding out -- from
          the inside.

Ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair.

                      BEN
          If the Draytons are at the Embassy,
          Hank has to be there too!

Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben.

                       BUCHANAN
              (Grimly)
          You're probably right.   But we can do
          nothing.

                      BEN
          Why can't you?

                      BUCHANAN
          Every Embassy in a foreign country has
          extra-territorial rights.

                      BEN
          What does that mean in common language?

                      BUCHANAN
          As far as we're concerned, this Embassy
          stands on foreign soil.

                      BEN
          Does that mean they can steal children
          and get away with it?

                      BUCHANAN
          We could have the Foreign Office serve
          a writ on the Ambassador.

He breaks off and speaks apologetically as If it were
I parenthesis.

                      BUCHANAN
          ...You know, I'm not responsible for
          the complications of International
          Law...

He resumes:

                      BUCHANAN
          ...If only we had positive proof that
          the boy really is in there.

As they are talking Ben is thinking hard, obviously
hatching some scheme in his mind.

                      BEN
          What's the telephone number of this
          Embassy.

Both of the men looking at Ben a moment without
answering and then Woburn speaks first.

                      WONBURN
          Grosvenor 0144.

                      JO
          What are you thinking about, Ben?

Without answering Jo, Ben picks up the 'phone.

                      BEN
          Grosvenor 0144.

Ben looks at the group briefly.   Buchanan looks at Ben
with keen curiosity.

                      BEN
          I'm going to speak to the Minister
          himself.

Buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. We hear the
answering click on the other end of the phone.

                      BEN
          May I speak to the Prime Minister,
          please?

There is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice
mumbling on the other end of the phone. Ben interrupts
the question.

                      BEN
          Tell him the lady who saved his life
          wants to speak to him. Its important.

The voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly,
and there is silent. Ben has a satisfied look on his
face, as he hands the receiver to Jo. She seems
frightened.

                      JO
          What am I supposed to say, Ben? I
          don't know --
              (She trails off)
          Ben, half looking at Woburn and
          Buchanan, gives her instructions.

                      BFN
          He said he wanted to visit us soon so
          he could thank you.

          have to leave London tomorrow.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

In the Ambassador's study underneath the oil painting
of himself, the Prime Minister is escorted to a
telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument.
Having been told who was on the other and of the line
he is all smiles as he greets Jo.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          My dear lady...This is a charming
          surprise...

He listens to the other end of the phone, agreeably
making sounds such as "ah ha" "ah" "hum", then he
speaks, with a gracious sweep of his hand and a half
bow to the telephone.

                      PRIME MINISTER
          Delighted, delighted, delighted. The
          Ambassador, too, will be delighted.
          Any friends of mine are friends of
          his. We will drink a little toast to
          your country and to mine. Peacefully
          we will co-exist...Yes?

He looks up to admire the painting of himself on the
wall.


INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo hangs up the phone, a little surprised and still
considerably nervous.

                       JO
              (To Ben)
          He said -- all right.

A taxi pulls up in the front of the large, old-fashioned
Embassy. The windows are brightly lighted, evidence
of a social occasion. Ben and Jo get out of the taxi.

Ben pays the driver, takes Jo's arm, and they start up
the steps of the Embassy. The CAMERA PANS them.

EXT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben presses the doorbell. His grip on Jo's's arm slides
down to her hand. He holds it tightly.

The door opens, and a liveried man ushers them in with
gesture.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes
the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of
people listening to the music of a string quartet
playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is
the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo
and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager.
The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid
a round of polite applause. There are people rising
from their chairs and a general movement out into the
hallway.

                     AIDE
          Good even. Would you come this way,
          please? The Prime Minister is waiting
          for you.

Following the Aide, Ben and Jo squeeze through the
crowded doorway.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the
CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room
people begin to notice them, first of all because they
are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks
seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of
applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize
them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who
is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first
row.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

The Prime Minister recognizes them immediately, and
comes forward quickly to meet them.

                      PRIME MINISTER
              (Effusively)
          Good evening, good evening!

The Ambassador is behind the Prime Minister, and the
Prime Minister turns to him with enthusiasm.

                      AMBASSADOR
              (Suavely)
          Madame, you saved the life of the one
          man, who is irreplaceable in our
          Country.

                      PRIME MINISTER
              (Suddenly to Jo)
          They tell me you are the famous Jo
          Conway, Madame?

                       JO
          Yes.   I'm Jo Conway.

                       PRIME MINISTER
              (To Ben)
          Do you think perhaps Madame might be
          persuaded to sing?

                      BEN
              (interrupting)
          I'm sure she would be glad to...
          wouldn't you dear?

                      JO
          Well, I don't know.     It's been some
          time...

                      PRIME MINISTER
          I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to
          conclude a dramatic evening!

                       JO
          All right.   I'm very flattered.

                      AMBASSADOR
              (To butler)
          Stanis would you put up some chairs
          quickly.
              (To guests)
          Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us
          tonight...Jo Conway...the famous Jo
          Conway...she has graciously consented
          to sing for us ..
              (To his wife)
          Darling would you see that the Prime
          Minister has a very good seat.

They move off to seats -- Jo is led to piano by
Ambassador. Aide crosses to Ben.

                      AIDE
          Would you like to sit down, sir?

                      BEN

Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over
toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes
are on Jo.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems
serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check
where Ben is.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be
more entertainment, move toward the main room.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A tries out the keys of the Piano.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

People are finding their seats. There is coughing,
shuffling of feet, and then a gradual hush.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng
around the room, particularly toward the various exits.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays
the introduction to her song. We see the great
tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional
smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but
always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice
seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole
room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place
that she has become so professional in such an intimate
drawing room setting.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - FULL SHOT

Everyone in the ballroom is listening intently, and
with surprise, at her singing.

The hallway, showing people crowded at the door,
listening.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The first landing on the flight of stairs above the
hallway. No one is around. Jo's voice loses some of
its volume.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

A higher stairway landing.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A second floor corridor, deserted.    Jo's voice fading.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the
song floating up clearly, but much diminished.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna
is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled.
Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his
feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to
open it.

                      HANK
          That's my Mother's voice!    That's my
          Mother singing!

Mrs. Drayton is quite startled by Hank's performance.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Hank -- are you sure? Are you really
          sure?

Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks
slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton,
listening and thinking about what he hears.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought
coming into it. She looks down at Hank.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Hank? -- can you whistle that song?


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

He looks at her and nods abstractedly.

                        HANK
          I guess so.

She kneels down quickly to him.

                      MRS DRAYTON
          Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it
          as loud as you can.

On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can
barely believe what she means. Then he understands.
He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to
whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously.
Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as
she watches him.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as
she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a
moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears
it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough
for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for
the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom
to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

Jo continues her song with almost excitement in her

follows Ben as he walks along the wall slowly.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ben makes his way along the wall toward the far doorway,
which leads to the grand staircase Everyone is so intent
on listening to Jo, that his movement attracts no
attention.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

At the bottom of the service stairs in the back of the
Embassy, Drayton is standing with two men who came
with him in the car. One of them holds a short length
of rope in his hand.

                      DRAYTON
          You two wait in the mail room.   I'll
          bring him down.

Ben mounts two stairs leading up to the grand staircase.
He looks about him cautiously.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

At the service stairs, Drayton goes up two stairs and
turns back to the men. He looks at his watch.

                      DRAYTON
          I won't be a minute.

He starts to move up one step.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Up in the room, Hank is bent in a chair, sobbing, Mrs.
Drayton is kneeling by him, trying to reassure him.
She stops suddenly as she hears footsteps in the
distance. She rises to her feet, and as the footsteps
grow and grow, she looks at the boy desperately, She
goes to the door, hears the steps coming nearer and
nearer. She looks across at the window.

She looks down at Hank almost protectively, as  the
footsteps get still nearer. She goes to Hank,   kneels
down again and clutches the boy to her as the  footsteps
stop outside the door. She looks at the door,   with
horror.

The door handle turns quietly, but firmly.

Mrs. Drayton lets out a piercing scream. Hank's head
jerks up. The door is heard bursting open.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward
Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet,
and the two of them come together. No clear words are
spoken, Just muffled sounds of words as they hug each
other. Then they release each other, and turn to look
at Mrs. Drayton. She is standing, staring at the door
with horror. Ben turns quickly to look.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Framed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches
into his pocket and produces a small automatic.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

For a moment the group stands there in silence.    Then
Ben speaks.

                      BEN
          I don't think you want to start any
          shooting, Drayton -- with all those
          people downstairs, and police outside.

Drayton looks at him without saying anything, but the
gun doesn't lower.

Mrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          You've got to let the boy go!

          Precisely my own notion, my dear.

He moves forward on   the group, gun poised. Hank
clutches his father   in fright, and Ben tenses himself,
prepared for battle   if necessary. Mrs. Drayton stares
at her husband with   some defiance. Drayton addresses
Ben amiably.

                      DRAYTON
          I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help
          me out of here?

          Don't ask me for help, you miserable....


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT

Drayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans
down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly.

                      DRAYTON
          You wouldn't want your father to get
          hurt, would you?

Hank looks up towards his father.    Drayton looks up.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down
at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode,
but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning.
Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face.
He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it.

                       DRAYTON
          We'll go down the stairs   together in a
          casual sort of way. Then    we'll stroll
          along to the nearest taxi   rank. I
          trust there won't be any   emotional
          outbursts...

                       BEN
              (Interrupting)
          There won't be. Hank -- don't say or
          do anything.

Hank just nods.   He's too frightened to talk.

                         DRAYTON
          Shall we go?

Ben starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves
into the other side of Hank. As they go through the
door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward,
if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of
Hank in danger stops her.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The trio, Hank in the center, slowly strolls down the
corridor toward the main stairway. The sound of Jo
Conway's voice can be heard from below.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

SHOOTING FROM BELOW we see the big staircase empty for
a moment, then the three appear at the top.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

A closer view shows the terrified, tear-stained face
of Hank, and the tense features of Ben. Drayton seems
carefully alert. The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front
of them as they descend. The music coming from the
ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There
is the sound of great applause. The three are about a
dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots
out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by
surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs
clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the
gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled
heap at the bottom of the stairs.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

The applause having died out, the shot is heard loud,
and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway.
They rush for the stairway, and Drayton's body, led by
the Ambassador and the Prime Minister.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As people crowd excitedly around the body, Ben is
hurrying Hank away from the scene, the CAMERA PANS
them.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Mrs. Drayton stops half-way down the stairway, and
looks down in shook at the sight of her dead husband.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Inside the ballroom, which is emptying due to the rush
of people to the corridor, Jo has risen from the piano
and is almost afraid to go out and see what has
happened. In a moment, Ben and the boy appear in  the
doorway. Hank rushes across the ballroom to his  mother,
who moves quickly when she sees him.

                         HANK
           Mummy.

                         JO
           Hank.

They embrace.

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:


INT. CLARIDGE'S SUITE - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT

Inside the McKenna's hotel room, the Parnells and the
two woman guests are sprawled out in ungainly attitudes
of sleep. Val is snoring pleasantly. The door of the
room opens and the three McKennas appear. The sound
awakes Val. He peers at them sleepily and struggles
to a sitting position. Ben closes the door.

                       BEN
           I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val,
           but we had to go and pick up Hank.

Ben's voice awakens the other women. They sit up, and
stare with bewilderment at the smiling trio of Ben, Jo
and Hank.

               Black.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But 
                         I never considered myself a barber...

               We track back from a barber's pole.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I stumbled into it--well, married 
                         into it more precisely...

               We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening 
               door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head 
               of a customer entering in slow motion.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I wasn't my establishment. Like 
                         the fella says, I only work here...

               We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, 
               aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The dump was 200 feet square, 
                         with five chairs, or stations as we 
                         call 'em, even though there were 
                         only two of us working...

               We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across 
               a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one 
               hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, 
                         was the principal barber. And man, 
                         could he talk...

               Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers 
               across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now maybe if you're eleven or 
                         twelve years old, Frank's got an 
                         interesting point of view, but 
                         sometimes it got on my nerves. Not 
                         that I'd complain, mind you. Like I 
                         said, he was the principal barber.  
                         Frank's father August--they called 
                         him Guzzi--had worked the heads up 
                         in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years 
                         until his ticker stopped in the middle 
                         of a Junior Flat Top. He left the 
                         shop to Frankie free and clear. And 
                         that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's 
                         ambitions: cutting the hair and 
                         chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk 
                         much...

               He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into 
               a tray.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I just cut the hair...

               LATE IN THE DAY

               The barbershop is empty of customers. Late sun slants in 
               through the front window. The two barbers--the narrator and 
               his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly 
               reading magazines.

                                     FRANK
                         Says here that the Russians exploded 
                         n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing 
                         we can do about it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         How d'ya like them apples?

               Beat.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed?

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     FRANK
                         Russians exploded an A-bomb.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Now, being a barber is a lot like 
                         being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's 
                         not much to it once you've learned 
                         the basic moves. For the kids there's 
                         the Butch, or the Heinie...

               We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:

                         ...the Flat Top, the Ivy, the Crew, 
                         the Vanguard, the Junior Contour 
                         and, occasionally, the Executive 
                         Contour. Adults get variations on 
                         the same, along with the Duck Butt, 
                         the Timberline...

               Ed trims the fringe around a balding head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and something we call the Alpine 
                         Rope Toss.

               He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes 
               it across a bald pate.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I lived in a little bungalow on 
                         Napa Street. The place was OK, I 
                         guess; it had an electric ice box, 
                         gas hearth, and a garbage grinder 
                         build into the sink. You might say I 
                         had it made.

               We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as 
               a black coupe pulls into the driveway.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Oh yeah. There was one other 
                         thing...

               We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting 
               on a girdle.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Doris kept the books at 
                         Nirdlinger's, a small department 
                         store on Main Street. Unlike me, 
                         Doris liked the work, accounting; 
                         she liked knowing where everything 
                         stood. And she got a ten per cent 
                         employee discount on whatever she 
                         wanted--nylon stockings...

               Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to 
               the garter.

                         ...make-up, and perfume...

               Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia 
               by Tuvache.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She wore a lot of perfume.

               Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee 
               table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster, 
                         was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the 
                         department store heiress. Tonight 
                         they were coming over for dinner--as 
                         Doris said, we were 'entertaining'...

               Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable 
               suit, smoking.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Me, I don't like entertaining.

               The doorbell rings.

               THE DOOR

               Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure, 
               bird-like wife.

                                     DAVE
                         How ya doin', Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK. Take your coat, Ann?

               DINNER TABLE

               The two couples are in the middle of the meal.

                                     DAVE
                         Japs had us pinned down in Buna for 
                         something like six weeks. Well, I 
                         gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it 
                         tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. 
                         *They* were eating grubs, nuts, 
                         thistles. When we finally up and 
                         bust off the beach we found Arnie 
                         Bragg, kid missing on recon; the 
                         Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if 
                         you'll pardon the, uh... And this 
                         was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' 
                         to write home about. I mean, I never 
                         would've, ya know, so what do I say, 
                         honey? When I don't like dinner, 
                         what do I say?

               Ann smiles wanly.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg--
                         *again*?!

               He roars with laughter.

               Ed gives an acknowledging smile.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!

               He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Were you in the service, Ed?

                                     ED
                         No, Dave, I wasn't.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed was 4F on account of his fallen 
                         arches.

                                     DAVE
                         Mm, that's tough.

               FRONT PORCH

               Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down. 
               Crickets chirp. From inside the house we hear laughter and 
               clattering dishes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all 
                         that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had 
                         the feeling that she and Big Dave 
                         were a lot closer than they let on...

               He turns and looks through the screen door into the house.

               Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly 
               lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the 
               counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter 
               while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing 
               dishes across.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The signs were all there plain 
                         enough--not that I was gonna prance 
                         about it, mind you. It's a free 
                         country.

               Footsteps approach the front porch.

               With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges.

                                     DAVE
                         Holding down the porch area?

               Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes, 
               forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front 
               lawn.

                                     DAVE
                         ...That's quite a wife you got there.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         She's a rare one.

                                     ED
                         How's business, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Couldn't be better. These're boom 
                         times in retailing. We're opening 
                         another store, Big Dave's Annex, 
                         there on Garson. This is strictly 
                         haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, 
                         ladies' foundations and undergarments. 
                         Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making 
                         Doris the comptroller. How're things 
                         at the, uh, the barbershop?

                                     ED
                         All right, I guess.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want 
                         to drop by the Annex when we open, 
                         update your suit--'course, you're in 
                         the smock all day.

               He chuckles.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Say, where do you get those things 
                         anyway?

                                     ED
                         Specialty store down in Sacramento.

                                     DAVE
                         Uh-huh.

               There is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big 
               Dave clears his throat.

               CHURCH

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I went to church once a 
                         week...

               We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting 
               the resurrection of Christ.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Usually Tuesday night...

               Faintly, we hear an amplified voice:

                                     CALLER
                         I... seven...

               Ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit 
               cigarette in his mouth.

                                     CALLER
                         ...Bee... Four...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris wasn't big on divine worship...

               Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of 
               her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and I doubt if she believed in 
                         life everlasting; she'd most likely 
                         tell you that our reward is on this 
                         earth and bingo is probably the extent 
                         of it...

               Still focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed:

                                     DORIS
                         Watch your card, honey.

                                     CALLER
                         I... sixteen...

               Ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from 
               his cigarette.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I wasn't crazy about the game, but, 
                         I don't know, it made her happy, and 
                         I found the setting peaceful.

                                     CALLER
                         Gee... nine...

               Doris sucks in her breath.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus, bingo--BINGO!

               BARBERSHOP

               Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. 
               Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, 
               a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the 
               vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I 
                         mean, if you're really serious. You 
                         tie your own flies, you do a--I know 
                         it's matickless, I know, people say, 
                         hey, you can buy flies at the store--
                         but you can buy your fish at the 
                         store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         The point is there's a certain art 
                         to the process. The point is not 
                         merely to provide, and let me point 
                         out, these fish are not as dumb as 
                         you might think.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Sportsmanship! That's my point. June 
                         fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? 
                         Well, what fish do you seek?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Sure, go to the store. Go there, 
                         describe to the man where you will 
                         be fishing, and for what, and the 
                         weather conditions, sun, no sun, 
                         whatnot, and so forth, and then you 
                         might as well have the man go ahead 
                         and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...

               We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows 
               at the far end of the shop. He is almost blown out by the 
               late-day sunlight hitting the window.

                                     FRANK
                         ...My point is, this is a man who 
                         knows nothing no matter how much you 
                         tell him, so sell him the goddamn 
                         FISH, Ed.

               The bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle-
               aged man walks in. He is well dressed--perhaps a little too 
               snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil 
               mustache.

                                     MAN
                         OK, boys, which of you gets the 
                         privilege?

                                     FRANK
                         We're just closing, friend.

                                     MAN
                         Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing 
                         well enough to turn away business! 
                         More power to ya, brother! The public 
                         be damned!

                                     FRANK
                         Hey, what's your problem, friend? 
                         This is a business establishment 
                         with posted hours--

               Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head.

                                     ED
                         I'll take care of him, go ahead, 
                         Frank. Have a seat, mister.

               Frank looks sourly at the stranger.

                                     FRANK
                         ...You sure, Eddie?

                                     ED
                         Yeah, yeah--go home.

               As Frank leaves:

                                     FRANK
                         In your ear, mister.

               The stranger chuckles.

                                     STRANGER
                         Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! 
                         Not so fast there, brother--

               Ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him 
               back; he lifts off a toupee.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the 
                         experts. 100 percent human hair, 
                         handcrafted by Jacques of San 
                         Francisco, and I'd hate to have to 
                         tell you what I paid for it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     STRANGER
                         Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for 
                         it down on the installment plan...

               Ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...A lot of folks live with the pate 
                         exposed. They say the dames think 
                         it's sexy. But for my money it's 
                         just not good grooming--and grooming, 
                         my friend, is probably the most 
                         important thing in business--after 
                         personality, of course...

               He twists around to offer his hand.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to 
                         know ya.

                                     ED
                         Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa 
                         Rosa?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         A goose, friend. I was chasing a 
                         wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard 
                         of venture capital?

                                     ED
                         Uh--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, it's the wildest goose there 
                         is. Risk money. Very speculative. 
                         Except, Ed, in certain situations, 
                         it's not, see? I thought I had a 
                         prospect here. Well, I make the haul 
                         up and this lousy so-and-so tells me 
                         his situation has changed--all his 
                         capital's gonna be tied up in 
                         expansion plans of his own. Thank 
                         you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! 
                         It's only the biggest business 
                         opportunity since Henry Ford and I 
                         can't seem to interest a soul!

                                     ED
                         That right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         It's called dry cleaning. You heard 
                         me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'--
                         wash without water, no suds, no 
                         tumble, no stress on the clothes. 
                         It's all done with chemicals, friend, 
                         and your garments end up crisp and 
                         fresh. And here's the capper: no 
                         shrinkage.

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         That's right! Dry cleaning--remember 
                         the name. It's going to revolutionize 
                         the laundry industry, and those that 
                         get in early are gonna bear the fruit 
                         away. All I need is $10,000 to open 
                         my first store, then I use its cash 
                         flow to finance another, and so on--
                         leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole 
                         chain. Well, me and a partner. 
                         Cleanliness, friend. There's money 
                         in it. There's a future. There's 
                         room to grow... Say, that's looking 
                         pretty good. Let's see it with the 
                         hairpiece on...

               BATHROOM DOORWAY

               It is evening. Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb 
               contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a 
               cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Dry cleaning...

               The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Was I crazy to be thinking about 
                         it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity, 
                         the real McCoy?

               Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...My first instinct was, no, no, 
                         the whole idea was nuts. But maybe 
                         that was the instinct that kept me 
                         locked up in the barbershop, nose 
                         against the exit, afraid to try 
                         turning the knob. What if I could 
                         get the money?

                                     DORIS
                         Honey?

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.

                                     DORIS
                         Shave my legs, will ya?

               Ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette 
               back in his mouth to free his hands. He picks up a bar of 
               soap and starts soaping the leg.

               He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor.

               The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark 
               bits of hair flecking the white foam.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was clean. No water. Chemicals.

               He shakes the razor in the tub. Shavings float away across 
               the soap-slicked water.

                                     DORIS
                              (absently, as she 
                              reads)
                         Gimme a drag.

               Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, 
               uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris 
               as she sucks.

               He brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to 
               his own mouth. She murmurs:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Love ya, honey.

               A DOOR

               We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into 
               laughter.

               A hand enters to knock.

                                     VOICE
                         Yeah, come in.

               The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves 
               sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. A tray of room-
               service dishes sits near him.

               He is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (into the phone)
                         OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

               He hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Oh, I thought you were the 
                         porter... Can I help you?

               Ed stands awkwardly by the door.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm, uh, Ed.

               The stranger's look does not show recognition.

                                     ED
                         ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at 
                         a disadvantage.

                                     ED
                         I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Jesus! The barber! I'll be a 
                         sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 
                         'Course--the barber.

               Ed nods, his smile faint and forced.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...I didn't recognize you without 
                         the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave 
                         something at the shop?

                                     ED
                         No. I might be interested in that, 
                         uh, business proposition--

               Creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and 
               arranges it on his head.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         You got the dough?!

                                     ED
                         I can get it, yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Come in, come in, siddown over there. 
                         Coffee?

                                     ED
                         No. I--tell me--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sure.

                                     ED
                         What's involved, aside from putting 
                         up the money? What're you looking 
                         for the partner to do?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want 
                         to keep tabs on your investment, of 
                         course, but I'm looking for a silent 
                         partner. I've done the research, 
                         I've contacted the vendors, the deal 
                         is set. I'm just looking for venture 
                         capital, friend. Disappear if you 
                         want, check in whenever you like--I 
                         want the dough; I don't take 
                         attendance.

                                     ED
                         And how do we share--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. 
                         You and me. Finance and expertise. 
                         So--you've got the dough then, do 
                         ya?

                                     ED
                         I'll have it in a week.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, I'll be damned. The barber! 
                         And I thought this trip was a bust. 
                         Well...

               He reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand 
               and hands Ed a glass.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...it just goes to show, when one 
                         door slams shut, another one opens. 
                         Here's to ya, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

               They both knock back the whiskey. Creighton leans back and 
               gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, 
               his hairpiece slightly askew.

               Ed stares back.

               After a beat, without taking his eyes of Ed, Creighton reaches 
               up and loosens his tie. An almost imperceptible wink.

               Ed stares.

                                     ED
                         ...Was that a pass?

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (hoarsely)
                         Maybe.

                                     ED
                         You're out of line, mister.

               Creighton throws up his hands apologetically.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         No problem!

                                     ED
                         Way out of line.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Right! Strictly business.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

               CLOSE ON TYPEWRITTEN NOTE

               It says:

               I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DORIS CRANE.  COOPERATE OR ED CRANE 
               WILL KNOW.  YOUR WIFE WILL KNOW. EVERYONE WILL KNOW. GATHER 
               $10,000 AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.

               A hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I sent it to Dave the next morning. 
                         And I waited.

               BARBERSHOP

               We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-old's crew 
               cut as clippers buzz its perimeter.

               Frank reads a magazine. The youngster reads a comic as Ed 
               works his head.

                                     ED
                         Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         Huh?

                                     ED
                         This hair.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah.

                                     ED
                         ...You ever wonder about it?

                                     FRANK
                         Whuddya mean?

                                     ED
                         I don't know... How it keeps on 
                         coming. It just keeps growing.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?

                                     ED
                         No, I mean it's growing, it's part 
                         of us. And we cut it off. And throw 
                         it away.

                                     FRANK
                         Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare 
                         the kid.

               Ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap.

                                     ED
                         OK, bud, you're through.

               The kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out 
               the door. Ed gives Frank a considering stare.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw 
                         it out in the dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the--

                                     ED
                         I'm gonna mingle it with common house 
                         dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the hell are you talking about?

               Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers.

                                     ED
                         I don't know. Skip it.

               EXT. ED'S HOUSE

               It is twilight. Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and, 
               cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk.

               Music filters out from the house.

               INT. ED'S HOUSE

               Ed walks though the living room, hands in his pockets. The 
               music emanates from a radio in the bedroom.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed?

               A track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her 
               hair. Her dress is half zipped at the back.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Gimme a zip.

               Ed walks over behind her.

                                     ED
                         Where you going?

                                     DORIS
                         Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I 
                         told you last week, for the Christmas 
                         Push.

                                     ED
                         Yeah, right.

               We are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, 
               the lowers it slightly. Her back blooms through the dark 
               fabric of the dress.

               He slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume 
               atomizer.

                                     DORIS
                         Come on, get ready. It's important.

                                     ED
                         Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.

                                     DORIS
                         Oh, don't be a grump.

               SALES FLOOR

               It is festooned with streamers.

               Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the 
               other bringing a cigarette to his lips.

               Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the 
               dance floor. Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms 
               over their knees.

               A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching, 
               his Adam's apple bobbing.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Wild, man!

               He goes out onto the dance floor. Ed, left by himself, gazes 
               across the floor.

               His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly 
               talking to Doris.

               Doris reacts angrily.

               Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris. He 
               glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation. 
               He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.

                                     VOICE
                         You in ladies' wear?

               The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at 
               the floor, snapping his fingers.

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Haven't I seen you up in ladies' 
                         wear?

                                     ED
                         I don't work here. My wife does.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Check out the rack on that broad in 
                         the angora.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               A hand is laid on Ed's shoulder. It is Big Dave; he leans in 
               to murmur:

                                     DAVE
                         Ed. Can I talk to you?

               BIG DAVE'S OFFICE

               Music from the party drifts in only faintly. The office is 
               built into a corner of the sales floor. It is dominated by a 
               large desk. A large window on the far side affords a partial 
               view of the floor.

                                     DAVE
                         Siddown. Siddown...

               Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. Dave fumbles 
               nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. He trims the end 
               of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel 
               grip.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Souveniered it off a Jap in New 
                         Guinea.

               He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags 
               up a chair to face Ed's.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I guess you're wondering what 
                         Doris was so hot about.

               The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the 
               window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave. Ed leans 
               forward for Dave to light his cigar.

                                     DAVE
                         ...These're Havanas. Romeo and 
                         Juliets. Private stock.

               Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Ed, I...

                                     ED
                         What is it, Dave?

               Dave breaks down, weeping. He buries his face in his hands, 
               the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his 
               hair.

                                     DAVE
                         Ed, I've been weak...

               His shoulders heave.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.

               Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been 
                         carrying on with a married woman. 
                         Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--
                         what is it they say?--the--the--the 
                         chickens are coming home to roost.

               Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, 
                         uh, that's not the worst of it. I 
                         got a note. A blackmail note. You 
                         know, come across or everybody knows.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, you know what that would do to 
                         me.

                                     ED
                         I guess it would be pretty awkward.

                                     DAVE
                         Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my 
                         keister! Hell, it's her family's 
                         store--*her* store. I serve at the 
                         indulgence of the goddamn ownership, 
                         Ed.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         I only work here! And the lady's 
                         husband would know... Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         How much to they want, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         $10,000! I don't know what to do, 
                         Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. 
                         Even though I know who the sonofabitch 
                         is.

                                     ED
                         ...You know... who *who* is?

                                     DAVE
                         The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. 
                         It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's 
                         a businessman from Sacramento. A 
                         goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope 
                         me into some crackpot scheme; I heard 
                         him out and then told him to go to 
                         hell. And the very next day, the 
                         very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed 
                         for the same amount.

                                     ED
                         Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, I guess he don't care that 
                         it's obvious.

                                     ED
                         Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--

                                     DAVE
                         He's staying at the hotel I've gone 
                         to with, uh, with the lady in 
                         question. Must've seen us.

               Big Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Thanks...

               He exhales with a long sigh.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         That's my capitalization on the Annex! 
                         *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. 
                         That's what I was just talking to 
                         Doris about, a way of getting the 
                         money from the store that we could 
                         hide from Ann.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn 
                         wife!

               He give a tearful chuckle.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Doris, she was pretty hot about 
                         that. God bless her. She doesn't 
                         know I'm telling you this--she's mad 
                         enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're 
                         the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm 
                         sorry I... I better get back to the 
                         party.

               He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his 
               face.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I look all right?

               PULLING ED

               He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room 
               lit only by spill from the party. It is the music department; 
               pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I 
                         knew the ten grand was going to pinch 
                         him where it hurt...

               Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. He takes 
               out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But Doris was two-timing me and I 
                         guess, somewhere, that pinched a 
                         little too.

               His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone 
               is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room.

               The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three-
               quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of 
               haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play.

               Ed listens. The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby.

               The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and 
               Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his 
               face.

               The piece ends.

                                     ED
                         That was pretty.

               The player turns, surprised. It is a young woman.

                                     ED
                         ...Did you make that up?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig 
                         van Beethoven.

               Ed nods recognition of the name.

                                     ED
                         That was quite something.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.

                                     ED
                         That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I know who you are, Mr Crane.

               His look shows surprise.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...My father used to take me with 
                         him when he got his hair cut. Walter 
                         Abundas?

               Ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls 
                         me Birdy.

                                     ED
                         Sorry, I just didn't remember.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, that's all right. You can't be 
                         expected to remember every skinny 
                         girl who comes in with her dad.

               Ed give a wry smile.

                                     ED
                         ...You don't like the music out there?

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. 
                         I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

               A woman calls sharply from offscreen:

                                     VOICE
                         Ed.

               He looks.

               Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat 
               over her arm, purse in hand.

               ED'S CAR

               Doris and Ed are driving home.

               Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at 
               the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     DORIS
                         Dave.

                                     ED
                         How's that?

                                     DORIS
                         Ahh...

               She waves angrily.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Money problems. He's thinking 
                         about canceling the Annex.

                                     ED
                         So?

                                     DORIS
                         *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               They ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

               STREET

               As the car roars past and into the distance.

               ANOTHER STREET

               It is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a 
               hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a 
               Packard and drives off.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Big Dave did it, though...

               Ed, sitting in his car, is watching.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sent a note telling him where 
                         to drop the money...

               HOTEL HALLWAY

               Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray 
               by the elevator.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and he did. He came across.

               Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and 
               pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag.

               He goes back to the stairwell.

               ANOTHER FLOOR

               Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks.

               The door swings open.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...

               Ed follows him into the room.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...You bring a check?

                                     ED
                         Cash.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Cash?!

               He gives Ed a look.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Usually we do this kind of thing 
                         with a bank draft. But cash--that's 
                         fine--it's all the same in the end--
                         dough's dough, huh?

                                     ED
                         Sure.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         I got the paperwork here. Partnership 
                         papers here, they reflect our 
                         agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I 
                         supply professional services, you 
                         supply the capital. I'll give you a 
                         receipt on the dough there, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Pretty straightforward, but I don't 
                         know if you wanna show this stuff to 
                         a lawyer--

                                     ED
                         It's OK.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to 
                         tangle it up and then you pay 'em to 
                         untangle it, what's the point?

               He perspires as he counts the money.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Just a second here, I'll give you 
                         a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, 
                         Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't 
                         talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm 
                         gonna call the place Tolliver's, 
                         after me, you know, I didn't think 
                         you were much interested in, uh--

                                     ED
                         That'll be fine.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...

               He wipes his brow, finishes counting.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Yeah, that's it. As per our 
                         discussion.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, there it is. Writ large in 
                         legal escriture, next step is--

                                     ED
                         Look, uh... Creighton...

               He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the 
               cigarette planted in his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...You're not gonna screw me on this?

                         *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a 
                         lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* 
                         cleaning, this is not some fly-by-
                         night thing here! I must say, I've 
                         been an entrepreneur for thirteen 
                         years and I've never--

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         And I've never been asked--Look, you 
                         want the dough back? You know who I 
                         am! You--

                                     ED
                         OK.

               Creighton mops his brow again.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?

               CAR

               Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth. Doris sits 
               next to him. Rural scenery slips by in the background.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The next day was Saturday. We were 
                         going to a reception for Doris' cousin 
                         Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner 
                         out near Modesto. Doris didn't much 
                         feel like going, and I didn't either, 
                         but, like she said, we had a 
                         Commitment.

               Doris gazes stonily out at the road. At length:

                                     DORIS
                         ...I hate wops.

               Ed gives her a brief glance. Doris glares at him.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What's so damn strange about that?

                                     ED
                         I didn't say a word.

               She looks back out at the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...*You* didn't have to grow up with 
                         'em.

               This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Family. Boy.

               BY A BARN

               Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled 
               with food.

               A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and 
               screams:

                                     CHILD
                         He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's 
                         ridin' Garibaldi!

               Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung 
               over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig. He slaps 
               at the pig's ass with a large straw hat.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         That was when she started drinking.

               Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine 
               from a water glass. Ed stands nearby.

               A large woman hugs Doris.

                                     WOMAN

                                     WOMAN

                                     ED
                         OK.

                         He's a barber, right? It's a good 
                         trade. So how come you got no kids?

               PICNIC TABLE

               A group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a 
               picnic table set out with pies in a row.

                         No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!

                         No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!

               An old man stands by with a stopwatch.

                         Ready...

               He clicks the timer.

                         ...Go!

               Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the 
               line of blueberry pies.

               The other picnickers cheer them on.

               clutches a trophy.

               When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against 
               it, leans forward, and vomits.

               CAR

               Late afternoon, driving home.

               Ed drives. Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring 
               lightly. Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to 
               his chest, eyes closed, murmuring:

                                     FRANK
                         I never wanna see another blueberry 
                         pie...

               Silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...I never even wanna hear those 
                         words.

               Doris moans.

               More silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Don't says those words, Ed.

               EXT. BUNGALOW

               It is twilight. Ed's coupe is parked in the driveway. He is 
               just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side 
               door. He pulls Doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris, 
               who has one arm draped around his neck. He helps her into 
               the bedroom and eases her onto the bed.

               He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her.

               Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face. She 
               is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with 
               perspiration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I'd met Doris blind on a double-date 
                         with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who 
                         was seeing a friend of hers from 
                         work. We went to a movie; Doris had 
                         a flask; we killed it. She could put 
                         it away. At the end of the night she 
                         said she liked it I didn't talk much. 
                         A couple weeks later she suggested--

               A harsh jangle from the telephone. Doris moans but does not 
               wake; Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the 
               phone.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE
                         Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to 
                         you.

                                     ED
                         What--now?

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

                                     ED
                         But it's...

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

               Ed sighs.

                                     ED
                         Your place?

                                     DAVE
                         I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself 
                         in.

                                     ED
                         OK.

               He hangs up.

               He nudges Doris.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She murmurs.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She rolls away and burrows into a pillow.

               Ed opens her purse and pokes through it.

               NIRDLINGER'S

               We are looking over Ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings 
               open a door.

               It reveals Big Dave's office, quiet and rather dark.

               A down-facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates Big Dave's 
               hands on the desktop.

                                     ED
                         ...Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Come on in.

               Ed enters, sits.

               An awkward silence.

                                     ED
                         ...What's the problem, Big Dave?

               Another silence.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm ruined.

               His hands writhe on the desktop.

                                     DAVE
                         ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. 
                         I'm all shot to hell.

                                     ED
                         So you paid the guy?

               Big Dave stares without speaking.

               After a long beat:

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     DAVE
                         What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave--

                                     DAVE
                         I'd understand if you'd walked in 
                         here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. 
                         I deserved it.

                                     ED
                         I, uh...

                                     DAVE
                         I'm not proud of what I did. But 
                         *you*.

               No one talks.

               Big Dave sighs.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. 
                         And then I went and found the pansy.

               He looks at Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, 
                         well, you already know the story. I 
                         didn't, I hadda beat it out of the 
                         pansy. *Your* money.

               No response.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave rises.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Well.

               He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly:

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm all shot to hell.

               Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him. 
               Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall.

               Ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave. Big 
               Dave wallops him in the stomach. Ed doubles over.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face 
               against the desktop. Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the 
               desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. He slams 
               him face-first into the window between the office and the 
               dark sales floor.

               Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against 
               the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat.

               Big Dave sweats and strains.

               A crack shoots up the pane of glass.

               Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's 
               neck.

               Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up to 
               his throat.

               Ed watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer.

               Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his 
               head twisted away.

               He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face-
               down onto the floor.

               Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees 
               but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knees 
               awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something 
               across the floor with his nose.

               He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself 
               in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through 
               the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him.

               Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. His 
               whole body shakes as he goes into shock.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into the 
               corner, face-down. He is still.

               The room is very quiet.

               Ed looks down at his hands.

               He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks 
               across the darkened sales floor.

               EXT. STORE

               Ed walks to his car. He does not look about, is not 
               particularly furtive. He gets into the car. He starts the 
               ignition.

               EXT. HOUSE

               He pulls up, sits motionless for a beat. Gradually, something 
               draws his attention; he cocks his head and looks up through 
               the windshield.

               A branch creaks and sways in the breeze.

               INT. HOUSE

               Ed gets into bed next to Doris. He stares at the ceiling. 
               Wind rustles outside.

               The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the 
               wind.

               He looks at Doris.

               Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth 
               is closed now, her breathing more peaceful. The leafy shadows 
               play over her face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was only a couple of weeks 
                         after we met that Doris suggested 
                         getting married. I said, Don't you 
                         wanna get to know me more? She said, 
                         Why, does it get better? She looked 
                         at me like I was a dope, which I've 
                         never really minded from her. And 
                         she had a point, I guess. We knew 
                         each other as well then as now...

               He is gazing at her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, well enough.

               Sound and image face.

               BARBERSHOP

               The next day.

               Ed cuts hair, a cigarette between his lips.

                                     FRANK
                         Holy-moly, do I got a headache.

               Frank is giving a haircut as well.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How you today, Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     FRANK
                         You don't got a headache?

                                     ED
                         ...Nah.

                                     FRANK
                         Damn, I got a headache to beat the 
                         band.

               LATER

               Ed sits in his chair, hands folded in his lap, head tilted 
               back, eyes closed.

               We hold on Ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and Frank talking 
               to someone in his chair.

                                     FRANK
                         Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it? 
                         That'll just flood it.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold 
                         it down. *That'll* flood it.

                                     FRANK
                         You crazy? You pumped it?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Well, ya can't hold it down.

               There is the jingle of the door bell. Ed opens his eyes.

               Two men in fedoras are entering.

               Ed starts to rise.

                                     MAN 1
                         Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Right.

                                     MAN 1
                         Come on outside.

                                     ED
                         Sure.

               OUTSIDE

               The two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant 
               to speak. One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker:

                                     MAN 2
                         ...So you're a barber, huh?

                                     ED
                         That's right.

                                     MAN 1
                         I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.

               Ed nods toward their car:

                                     ED
                         ...We goin'?

                                     KREBS
                         Huh? No.

               Beat.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Cigarette?

               Ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette.

                                     PERSKY
                         Right. Uh... Pete's got some news 
                         for you.

               His partner gives Persky a dirty look.

                                     KREBS
                         ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, 
                         but, uh... well damnit, your wife's 
                         been pinched.

                                     PERSKY
                         They sent us to tell ya.

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         They sent us to tell ya. We pulled 
                         the detail.

                                     ED
                         My *wife*?

                                     PERSKY
                         Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county 
                         jail, uh...

                                     KREBS
                         Homicide.

                                     PERSKY
                         Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A 
                         guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... 
                         He's the decedent.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     KREBS
                         He's the dead guy.

               Ed stares at him.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Yeah, it's a tough break.

                                     KREBS
                         Visiting ends at five. Too late today. 
                         You can see her tomorrow.

                                     PERSKY
                         Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.

               He shakes his head.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Crap detail.

               RESIDENTIAL STREET

               It is evening. Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined 
               street similar to his own. He gets out of his car and goes 
               up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a 
               hand of greeting.

                                     MAN
                         'Lo, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Walter.

               He steps up on the porch.

               The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks 
               as the swing moves. His skin glistens with drinker's sweat, 
               and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's 
               put at least a couple away.

                                     WALTER
                         Have a seat.

               Ed glances around but the swing is the only seat. He sits 
               next to Walter.

                                     ED
                         Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at 
                         home.

                                     WALTER
                         Oh, hell. Drink?

                                     ED
                         No thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Sure you don't need one?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine.

                                     WALTER
                         OK. Boy. Jesus!

                                     ED
                         Yeah. What do I, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of 
                         my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, 
                         probate, real estate, title search, 
                         uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, 
                         something like this. Absolutely 
                         worthless.

               He belches.

                                     WALTER
                         'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. 
                         Frankly, Doris'd be better off with 
                         the county defender.

                                     ED
                         He a good man?

                                     WALTER
                         Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I 
                         won't kid you though, Ed, nobody 
                         around here has any experience with 
                         this kind of, er... And I hear they're 
                         bringing a prosecutor up from 
                         Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking 
                         it seriously... Hmm...

                                     ED
                         So--

                                     WALTER
                         Taking it seriously.

                                     ED
                         So, who should I--

               The front door opens and someone speaks through the screen:

                                     VOICE
                         You want any coffee, Dad?

               Ed looks around at the voice.

                                     VOICE
                         Oh, hello, Mr Crane.

               She steps out: it is Birdy Abundas.

               Ed rises, and they awkwardly shake hands.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Rachel.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

                                     ED
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Coffee, Ed?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         No thanks, honey.

                                     BIRDY
                         OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.

               They watch her go back in.

                                     WALTER
                         Damnit! She's a good kid.

               Ed nods.

               A beat.

                                     ED
                         ...So, uh, who should I--

                                     WALTER
                         Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San 
                         Francisco. Probity--you know, no one 
                         ever said anything iffy about Lloyd 
                         Garroway. Conservative. Jury might 
                         like that. Might like that here.

               He takes a sip of his drink.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Probity.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, 
                         uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, the best, the money-is-no-object 
                         best, for a criminal case, any lawyer 
                         would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. 
                         Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't 
                         know how you're fixed for money.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. He's the, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Yeah, the best.

               He sniffs.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I 
                         could tell you more. Hell, I wish I 
                         could handle it myself. But I'd be 
                         absolutely worthless for this kind 
                         of thing.

               He takes a musing sip.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Criminal matter? Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider.

               He thinks.

                                     WALTER
                         ...No question about it.

               ED AT A TABLE

               It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides, 
               one side for prisoners, the other for visitors. The room is 
               empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across 
               from a younger woman at the far end of the table. The younger 
               woman, in a prison smock, is wailing. The elderly woman is 
               holding her hand.

               Ed sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed 
               toiletries kit. There are echoing voices suggesting large 
               spaces outside the room.

               He sits and waits.

               Approaching footsteps.

               The door opens. A large prison matron steps aside to let 
               Doris enter.

               Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big 
               for her. Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled. Not only is 
               she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on 
               her lip.

               As Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around.

                                     ED
                         Honey... I brought your make-up.

               She looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Honey.

                                     ED
                         How are you?

               She shrugs.

                                     DORIS
                         I don't know what's going on. I--

                                     ED
                         What happened to you?

               She shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...I don't know what happened to Big 
                         Dave. I know some of it. 
                         Irregularities in my books, they 
                         said. Can I explain it.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to--

                                     DORIS
                         I helped him cook the books, Ed. I 
                         did do that.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell them anything. 
                         We're getting you a lawyer.

               Doris doesn't seem to be listening. She sighs:

                                     DORIS
                         I know all about that. But I don't 
                         know how much to tell them.

                                     ED
                         Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting 
                         you Freddy Riedenschneider.

               Doris finally looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Should I... should I tell you why?

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell me anything.

               Her gaze drifts away again. She notices the sobbing woman.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus Christ.

               Doris looks around and laughs.

                                     DORIS
                         ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone 
                         could open them up, make sense of 
                         the whole goddamn store.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

                                     DORIS
                         I knew we'd pay for it.

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock. Frank 
               paces in front of him. He smacks a fist into his palm.

                                     FRANK
                         This is what family is for, Ed! This 
                         is when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons 
                         of bitches!

                                     ED
                         Frank, uh, you know I'll try to 
                         contribute, but, uh--Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider--

                                     FRANK
                         I don't care what it costs! This is 
                         when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         That's very generous.

                                     FRANK
                         The hell with it, Eddie!

               BANK

               Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby. 
               Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit. As they 
               wait, he looks nervously about.

               In a hushed voice:

                                     FRANK
                         They're just people like you and me, 
                         Ed. Remember that.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Just people. They gotta put up the 
                         big front so that people will trust 
                         them with their money. This is why 
                         the big lobby, Ed. But they put their 
                         pants on one leg at a time. Just 
                         like you and me.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite 
                         of appearances. And their money will 
                         be secured by the barbershop. A rock. 
                         A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, 
                         how long has *this* place been here?

               A door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle 
               age emerges.

                                     MAN
                         Mr Raffo?

               Frank hops to his feet.

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Could you come with me please?

                                     FRANK
                         Sure. Can Ed come too?

               The man looks dubiously at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         Mr...?

                                     ED
                         Crane. Ed Crane.

                                     MAN
                         You also have an interest in the 
                         securing property?

                                     FRANK
                         He's a barber.

                                     MAN
                         Ah.

                                     FRANK
                         Second chair.

                                     MAN
                         Not an owner.

                                     FRANK
                         No, he's family, he's my brother-in-
                         law.

                                     MAN
                         Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited 
                         here.

               He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank 
               trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, and 
               we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the 
               words lost.

               Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of 
               business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped 
               to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes 
               successive documents across his desk with a word of 
               explanation for each as Frank signs.

               Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The barbershop. Doris and Frank's 
                         father had worked thirty years to 
                         own it free and clear. Now it got 
                         signed over to the bank, and the 
                         bank signed some money over to Frank, 
                         and Frank signed the money over...

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               It is midday. We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a 
               long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb. A couple of 
               kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is 
               no doubt the fanciest in town.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who 
                         got into town two days later...

               Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a 
               restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that 
               obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spells 
               out "DaVinci's".

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and told me to meet him at 
                         DaVinci's for lunch.

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               Inside the restaurant. We are tracking toward a table whose 
               lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu 
               as he orders from a facing waitress:

                                     MAN
                         ...not fried, poached. Three of 'em 
                         for two minutes. A strip steak medium 
                         rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato 
                         juice, and plenty of hot coffee.

               He flips the menu over.

                                     MAN
                         ...Do you have prairie oysters?

                                     WAITRESS
                         No, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Then bring me a fruit cocktail while 
                         I wait.

               He looks up at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         ...You're Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Yeah--

                                     MAN
                         Barber, right? I'm Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell 
                         me the chow's OK here. I made some 
                         inquiries.

                                     ED
                         No thanks, I--

               The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of 
               Riedenschneider.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Look, I don't wanna waste your time 
                         so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind?  
                         *You* don't mind. So while I'm in 
                         town I'll be staying at the Hotel 
                         Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, 
                         it's goofy, the suites're named after 
                         operas; room's OK though, I poked 
                         around. I'm having 'em hold it for 
                         me on account of I'll be back and 
                         forth. In addition to my retainer, 
                         you're paying hotel, living expenses, 
                         secretarial, private eye if we need 
                         to make inquiries, headshrinker should 
                         we go that way. We'll talk about 
                         appeals if, as and when. For right 
                         now, has she confessed?

                                     ED
                         No. Of course not. She didn't do it.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! That helps. Not that she didn't 
                         do it, that she didn't confess. Of 
                         course, there's ways to deal with a 
                         confession, but that's good!--one 
                         less thing to think about. Now. 
                         Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. 
                         You should be there. Three o'clock. 
                         One more thing: you keep your mouth 
                         shut. I get the lay of the land, I 
                         tell *you* what to say. No talking 
                         out of school. What's out of school? 
                         Everything's out of school. I do the 
                         talking; you keep your trap shut. 
                         I'm an attorney, you're a barber; 
                         you don't know anything. Understood?

                                     ED
                         ...OK.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! Any questions give me a ring--
                         Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a 
                         message. You sure you don't want 
                         anything? No?

               He points a finger at Ed.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's 
                         OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.

               The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And the flapjacks, honey.

               DRIVING POINT OF VIEW

               We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the 
               windshield of a moving car.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         All going about their business. It 
                         seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger 
                         one even then what had really happened 
                         to Big Dave, something none of them 
                         knew...

               On Ed, driving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Like I had made it to the outside, 
                         somehow, and they were all still 
                         struggling, way down below.

               ED IN BED

               Arms folded behind his head, staring at the ceiling.

               On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb.

               A distant, muffled knock.

               Ed turns his head.

               FRONT DOOR

               Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe.

               The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black: a 
               black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her 
               bird-like frame.

               Wind rustles in the trees behind her.

               She stares at Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann.

               For the first time, we hear her speak, in a low, tremulous 
               voice:

                                     ANN
                         Hello, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann. Will you come in?

               She shakes her head.

                                     ANN
                         ...No, No, it's very late.

               Ed nods.

               After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues to 
               stare:

                                     ED
                         ...I'm so sorry about your loss.

                                     ANN
                         Yes. Thank you.

                                     ED
                         Of course, you know, Doris had nothing 
                         to do with it. Nothing at all.

               She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm.

                                     ANN
                         Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came 
                         to tell you...

                                     ED
                         Yes, Ann?

                         And you should tell Doris...

               She falls silent. The trees behind her rustle.

               She gives a wary look back. Then, confidingly, to Ed:

                         ...You know how Big Dave loved 
                         camping. And the out-of-doors.

               Ed is puzzled:

                                     ED
                         Yes?

                         Ed.

               She gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he 
               will find this significant.

                         outside of our official report.

                         it will all come out.

               She turns and heads down the walk.

               Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk, 
               then are lost in the rustle of leaves.

               Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller.

               PRISON MEETING ROOM

               It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs. 
               One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight.

               Ed and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands 
               to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into 
               his pockets.

               All three are motionless for a long beat. Finally:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It stinks.

                         But it's true.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't care it's true, it's not 
                         true; it stinks. You say he was being 
                         blackmailed; by who? You don't know. 
                         For having an affair; with who? You 
                         don't know. Did anyone else know 
                         about it? Probably not; you don't 
                         know.

                         I knew about it. Big Dave told me 
                         about it, and the spot he was putting 
                         himself in by getting the money.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER

               He starts pacing.

                         and then they got *you*, a disgruntled

               Riedenschneider gives him a hard look.

                         ...Like I say, it stinks.

               Another long pause.

                         ...I killed him.

               Riedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning.

                         OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* 
                         killed him. How come?

                         He and Doris... were having an affair.

               Doris eyes him. His manner does not reveal anything.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER

                         How did you get into the store?

                         On your way there? In there? On your

                         Will anyone corroborate and goddamn 
                         part of your story at all?

               Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare. Riedenschneider resumes 
               pacing.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Come on, people. You can't help 
                         each other like that. Let's be 
                         realistic now. Let's look at our 
                         options. Well, frankly, I don't *see* 
                         any options.

               A nod of the head indicates Doris:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...I cannot present Story A.

               Another nod indicates Ed:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...I cannot present Story B. I could 
                         plead you for a nutcase but you look 
                         too composed. I could offer a guilty 
                         plea and in return they don't give 
                         you the juice, but I don't think you 
                         want to spend the rest of your life 
                         in Chino and I know you didn't hire 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your 
                         hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell, 
                         you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway 
                         for that. No, we're not giving up 
                         yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, 
                         it means you're *not* throwing in 
                         the towel. I litigate, I don't 
                         capitulate. All right, no options, 
                         we gotta think. All right, we go 
                         back to the blackmail thing. It 
                         titillates, it's open ended...

               His pacing becomes more animated.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And it makes *him* the bad guy--
                         ya dig around, ya never know, 
                         something unsavory from his past, he 
                         approaches you to help with the money, 
                         it's too late, his past comes back 
                         to haunt him, who's to say...

               He is heading for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous 
                         husband thing, that's silly; we're 
                         going with the blackmail. I'll be in 
                         touch.

               The door slams.

               HOTEL LOBBY

               The camera drifts in toward the reception desk. Ed talks to 
               the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we 
               hear only Ed's narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Of course, there was *one* person 
                         who could confirm Doris's story, or 
                         plenty of it: the dry-cleaning 
                         pansy...

               The desk clerk is shaking his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But he'd left the hotel, skipped 
                         out on his bill...

               HALLWAY

               It is a rooming-house hallway. A stern middle-aged woman is 
               on the hall telephone. This too plays silently under the 
               narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He'd also disappeared from the 
                         residence he gave me...

               ED'S LIVING ROOM

               We are drifting in toward Ed, who nods at the telephone and 
               then cradles it. He stares down at the business card he holds.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...owing two month's rent. How could 
                         I have been so stupid. Handing over 
                         $10,000. For a piece of paper. And 
                         the man gone... like a ghost...

               PULLING BACK FROM ED

               In a different living room. He sits on a sofa, hands clasped 
               behind his head, listening. For the first time, as the voice-
               over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano 
               music.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...disappeared into thin air, 
                         vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki. 
                         Gone now. All gone. The money gone. 
                         Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could 
                         I have been so stupid?

               The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby 
               chair, also listening as Birdy plays.

               Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids 
               droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion 
               his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, 
               and he starts lightly to snore.

               The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at 
               the cut. Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs, 
               administering haircuts.

               The customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do 
               not hide rolls of fat. He has a hot towel over his face that 
               does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some 
               extent:

                         She makes this stuff, she calls it 
                         gatto, it's got egg in there, it's 
                         got sugar, it's got--it's cake, 
                         basically, except she calls it gatto. 
                         Like if you don't call it cake maybe 
                         you won't put on any weight, like I 
                         need to eat gatto, you know what I'm 
                         saying? This stuff, if I've had a 
                         square meal, I've had my steak and 
                         potatoes, I can just have another 
                         cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask 
                         for the desert if it's not there...

               His voice turns into a drone under the narration.

               CRANE DOWN

               Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, 
               the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff 
               reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy 
               Riedenschneider.

                         Most people think someone's accused 
                         of a crime, they haul 'em in and 
                         bring 'em to trial, but it's not 
                         like that, it's not that fast. The

                         the indictment, and they entertain 
                         motions to dismiss, and postpone, 
                         and change the venue, and alter this 
                         and that and the other. They empanel 
                         a jury, which brings more motions, 
                         and they set a trial date and then 
                         change the date, and then often as 
                         not they'll change it again.

               OPERA SINGERS

               We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in 
               character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, 
               dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths 
               of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. We 
               pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, 
               floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a 
               mask over his eyes, slumbers.

               LATERAL TRACK

               From inside a car. Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. Among 
               them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to 
               the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind.

               Moving the opposite way. A different day, but again a crowd 
               moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man 
               scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his 
               hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring 
               his face.

               PUSHING IN TO ED

               In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy 
               at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I found myself more and more going 
                         over to the Abundas's. It was a 
                         routine we fell into, most every 
                         evening. I even went when Walter was 
                         away on his research trips. He was a 
                         genealogist, had traced back his 
                         side of the family seven generations, 
                         his late wife's, eight. It seemed 
                         like a screwy hobby. But then maybe 
                         all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found 
                         something there, in the old county 
                         courthouses, hospital file rooms, 
                         city archives, property rolls, 
                         registries, something maybe like 
                         what I found listening to Birdy play. 
                         Some kind of escape. Some kind of 
                         peace...

               The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but 
               then is snapped by a sharp clang.

               PRISON DOOR SWINGS OPEN

               We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room. 
               None of its three occupants is moving.

               The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table; the 
               private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped 
               back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his 
               fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between 
               his teeth; and Freddy Riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped 
               behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the 
               shaft of light that slants through the high window.

               A warder shuts the door behind Ed.

               Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance; 
               Riedenschneider does not.

               Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris, clasps his hands on 
               top of hers.

                                     ED
                         'Lo, honey.

               She looks at his hands on top of hers.

               A long beat.

               Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy 
               Riedenschneider announces:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...They got this guy, in Germany. 
                         Fritz something-or-other. Or is it. 
                         Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got 
                         this theory, you wanna test something, 
                         you know, scientifically--how the 
                         planets  go round the sun, what 
                         sunspots are made of, why the water 
                         comes out of the tap--well, you gotta 
                         look at it. But sometimes, you look 
                         at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya 
                         can't know the reality of what 
                         happened, or what *would've* happened 
                         if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn 
                         schnozz. So there *is* no 'what 
                         happened.' Not in any sense that we 
                         can grasp with our puny minds. Because 
                         our minds... out minds get in the 
                         way. Looking at something changes 
                         it. They call it the 'Uncertainty 
                         Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, 
                         but even Einstein says the guy's on 
                         to something.

               His gaze up at the window breaks. He strolls around the room, 
               still smiling.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Science. Perception. Reality. 
                         Doubt...

               He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin', 
                         sometimes, the more you look, the 
                         less you really know. It's a fact. A 
                         proved fact. In a way, it's the only 
                         fact there is. This heinie even wrote 
                         it out in numbers.

               He looks up at the private detective.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Burns?

               With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that its 
               front legs slap down onto the floor. He fishes a small 
               notebook from an inside pocket.

               His boredom is profound; his only concession to performance 
               is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the 
               other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.

                         to his service record.

               Burns looks at him sourly. He flips a couple of pages.

                                     BURNS

               Riedenschneider nods, smiling.

                         ...Thank you, Burns, get lost.

               Burns pockets his notebook, adjusts his hat, jams his hands 
               into his pockets, and ambles out of the room.

               The slam of the door leaves quiet.

               At length:

               Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades.

                         all by himself with a knife in one 
                         hand and a gun in the other and twenty 
                         yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         And now it turns out this dope spent 
                         the war sitting on his ass in some 
                         boatyard in San Diego. You asked for 
                         blackmail, let me give you blackmail: 
                         Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to 
                         open his own business here, has been 
                         lying to everybody in this town for 
                         the last four years, probably 
                         including half the people sitting on 
                         that jury. Well, it finally caught 
                         up with him--these dopes, it always 
                         does; someone threatened to spill 
                         it. Somebody knew his dirty little 
                         secret, just like your wife says. 
                         They called, they demanded money...

               He is looking at Doris.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Did Big Dave mention that it was 
                         something about his war service? I 
                         don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* 
                         have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, 
                         maybe he didn't; I'm not putting 
                         words in your mouth; the point is 
                         that this liar, this cynical 
                         manipulator, this man who through 
                         his lies sneered and belittled the 
                         sacrifice and heroism of all our 
                         boys who *did* serve and bleed and 
                         puke and die on foreign shores, and 
                         who made a fool out of this entire 
                         town, turns to *you* to help him out 
                         of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!

                                     ED
                         So... who... who actually--

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But 
                         the point is that if Mr Prosecutor 
                         over there had devoted half the time 
                         he's spent persecuting *this* woman 
                         to even the most cursory investigation 
                         of this schmoe's past, then we might 
                         *know* who! But we can't *know* what 
                         really happened! Because of Fritz, 
                         or Werner, or whatever the hell his 
                         name is! And because Me Prosecutor 
                         is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch 
                         who decided it's easier to victimize 
                         your wife! Because it's easier *not* 
                         to look! Because the more you look, 
                         the less you know! But the beauty of 
                         it is, we don't *gotta* know! We 
                         just gotta show that, goddamnit, 
                         *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. 
                         Science. The atom. *You* explain it 
                         to me. Go ahead. Try.

               He chuckles as he heads for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees 
                         daylight. We got a real shot at this, 
                         folks. Let's not get cocky.

               The door shuts behind him.

               Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.

               A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her 
               mouth.

                                     ED
                         Honey...?

               The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. 
               Ed frowns.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey?

               Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides 
               and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes 
               her head:

                                     DORIS
                         What a dope.

               ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM

               Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, 
               her eyes on the sheet music:

                                     BIRDY
                         He was deaf when he wrote this.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     BIRDY
                         Beethoven. He created it, and yet he 
                         never actually heard it. I suppose 
                         he heard it all in his head, somehow.

               Over her continued playing:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         So maybe Riedenschneider could get 
                         Doris off. Maybe it would all work 
                         out. And I thought--I hoped--that 
                         maybe there was a way out for me as 
                         well...

               A SIGN

               The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL / 
               PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949, 
               8:00 P.M.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The girl had talent, anyone could 
                         see that. And *she* wasn't some fly-
                         by-nighter, she was just a good clean 
                         kid...

               SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

               A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift 
               stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the 
               baby grand that has been set out center stage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...If she was going to have a career 
                         she'd need a responsible adult looking 
                         out for her...

               We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set 
               out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, 
               many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest 
               on Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...some kind of... manager. She'd 
                         have contracts to look at, be going 
                         on tours, playing on the radio maybe. 
                         I could help her sort through all of 
                         that, without charging her an arm 
                         and a leg, just enough to get by...

               Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience.

               EXT. SCHOOL

               Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm 
               summer night. He looks around the parking lot.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I could afford to charge less 
                         than the usual manager, not having 
                         to put up a big front like a lot of 
                         these phonies. And I could be with 
                         her, enough to keep myself feeling 
                         OK...

               A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, 
               laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another 
               student--a boy.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Why couldn't that work?... Why 
                         not?...

               Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's 
               drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hi, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy. I thought that was 
                         very good.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, in there? I messed up a little 
                         bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody 
                         noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is 
                         Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr 
                         Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Tony.

                                     TONY
                         Hello, sir.

               Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the 
               conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears 
               his throat.

                                     ED
                         ...Well, congratulations. I guess 
                         I'll be getting home.

                                     TONY
                         Nice to meet you, sir.

               TURANDOT SUITE

               It is morning. We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the 
               bathroom, where we hear water running.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking 
                         about in the days leading up to the 
                         trial. It seemed like once that was 
                         over, I'd be ready for a new start. 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider was very 
                         optimistic. He was busy preparing...

               We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider 
               hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water. 
               He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some 
               tonic in his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And finally it came... the first 
                         day of the trial...

               Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...What Riedenschneider called the 
                         Big Show.

               He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist.

               COURTROOM

               We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair. 
               He is sitting at the defense table.

               There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to 
               order.

                                     FRANK
                         Where's the judge? How come there's 
                         no judge?

               Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row 
               directly behind Riedenschneider.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Where's the judge, Ed?

               Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How come the judge doesn't come 
                         out?

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         The judge comes in last. He'll come 
                         in when Doris gets here.

                                     FRANK
                         So where's Doris? I thought we started 
                         at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's 
                         Doris?

               Riedenschneider is curt:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         She's late.

                                     FRANK
                         Late? How can she be late?

               Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* 
                         are in prison, and yet we're not 
                         late. We're on time, Ed. How can 
                         Doris be late? What, they don't have 
                         wake-up calls?

               The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's 
               bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters.

               The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down 
               and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his 
               desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider 
               and the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Counselors.

               Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his 
               counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leaning 
               forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible 
               from the gallery.

               The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones. 
               Frank leans in toward Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         What's going on, Ed? I thought there 
                         would be arguments. The bailiff, and 
                         so forth...

               Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly 
               stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider 
               looks back over his shoulder at Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed, what is this? Is this 
                         procedure?

               The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their 
               respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man 
               standing to one side.

                                     JUDGE
                         Bailiff.

               As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks 
               down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various 
               papers.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't understand... We had a real 
                         shot at it... We could have won this 
                         thing...

               The Bailiff Announces:

                                     BAILIFF
                         In the matter of the State of 
                         California versus Doris Crane, Case 
                         Number 87249 assigned to this Superior 
                         Court...

               As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It doesn't make any sense...

               BARBERSHOP

               Late afternoon sun slants in.

               The shop, not open for business, is very still. Ed, in his 
               courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line 
               the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees.

               Frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber 
               chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She'd hanged herself. I'd brought 
                         her a dress to wear to court and 
                         she'd used the belt. I didn't 
                         understand it either. At first I 
                         thought maybe it had something to do 
                         with me, that she'd figured out 
                         somehow how I fit into it and couldn't 
                         stand it, couldn't stand knowing...

               BEDROOM

               Night. Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That wasn't it, I would find out 
                         later. For now, everything just seemed 
                         ruined...

               METROPOLE LOBBY

               Riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind 
               him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back 
                         to Sacramento still shaking his head, 
                         saying it was the biggest 
                         disappointment of his professional 
                         career...

               FRANK'S HOUSE

               Day. Frank's kitchen.

               Frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown 
               over his pyjamas, unshaven.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect 
                         he was drinking; anyway, he stopped 
                         coming to work...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed, in his smock, works on a customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That left me to keep the place 
                         going, or the bank would've taken 
                         it.

               As he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between 
               his lips. He squints against the smoke drifting past his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...*I* was the principal barber now. 
                         I hired a new man for the second 
                         chair...

               Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a 
               gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I'd hired the guy who did the 
                         least gabbing when he came in for an 
                         interview. But I guess the new man 
                         had only kept quiet because he was 
                         nervous; once he had the job, he 
                         talked from the minute I opened the 
                         shop in the morning...

               EXT. BARBERSHOP

               It is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him 
               on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating 
               to illustrate his store.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until I locked up at night. For 
                         all I know, he talked to himself on 
                         the way home.

               STREET

               Ed walks along the sidewalk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...When *I* walked home, it seemed 
                         like everyone avoided looking at 
                         me...

               Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; their 
               averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...as if I'd caught some disease. 
                         This thing with Doris, nobody wanted 
                         to talk about it; it was like I was 
                         a ghost walking down the street...

               HOUSE

               As Ed lets himself in.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And when I got home now, the place 
                         felt empty.

               He sits on the couch and, after a beat, takes a cigarette 
               pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sat in the house, but there was 
                         nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't 
                         see anyone; no one saw me...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed is in his smock again, operating the clippers.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was the barber.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               The drone of the clippers has continued over the black. A 
               voice fades up:

                                     VOICE 1
                         So two blocks later I look at the 
                         change she gave me and, golly, I'm 
                         two bits short.

                                     VOICE 2
                         Two bits short.

                                     VOICE 1
                         So I walk back over to Linton's, 
                         find this gal--big argument; she 
                         doesn't even recall the transaction.

                                     VOICE 2
                         No recollection.

                                     VOICE 1
                         Doesn't recall the transaction, no 
                         recollection, so I said, Look, dear...

               FADE IN

               We are looking at a magazine story. Its headline, over an 
               illustration of a cresting wave, is: WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

               Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment 
               and racks of clothing on motorized tracks. Subheadlines read: 
               NEXT TO GODLINESS - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The 
               Thoroughly Modern Way To Clean.

               Ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs, staring at Life magazine. 
               The offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on 
               a customer.

                                     NEW MAN
                         ...go ahead, look at the menu, if 
                         you're in before six o'clock it's 
                         the, whatchamacallit, the--

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Early Bird Special.

                                     NEW MAN
                         What? Yeah, the Early Riser...

               Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph 
               of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in 
               the sky. The caption underneath: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.

                                     VOICE
                         Crane?

               Ed looks up.

               A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question 
               at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentarily 
               slackjawed.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm Crane.

                                     MAN
                         My name is Diedrickson. County medical 
                         examiner.

                                     ED
                         Yeah?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Just came for an informal chat...

               Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Why don't I buy you a drink?

               Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock, 
               addresses the new man, who still gapes.

                                     ED
                         Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?

                                     DWIGHT
                         Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your 
                         time.

               BAR

               It is late afternoon, dusty and empty.

               Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking 
               his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position.

               As the bartender approaches:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Rye.

                                     ED
                         Just coffee.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         You sure you don't want something 
                         stiffer?

               Ed shrugs and shakes his head.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Coffee it is.

               He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop 
               and stares at them. After a beat:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...County M. E. does an autopsy on 
                         anyone who dies in custody. I don't 
                         know if you knew that. It's routine.

               Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at 
               his hands, plows on:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Doesn't become a matter of public 
                         record unless there's foul play. 
                         However. I don't believe I'm 
                         *prohibited* from telling you this. 
                         I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, 
                         either. I don't exactly know.  But 
                         if *I* were the man, I'd want to be 
                         told.

                                     ED
                         Told what?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         I, uh... thanks.

               The bartender has set down the drinks.

               Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his 
               glass. Finally:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry to add to your burden, 
                         Crane, but I'd want to know it it 
                         was me. Your wife was pregnant. First 
                         trimester.

               A pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Well, there it is.

               Another pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry.

               He mutters to himself:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Hell, I hope I've done the right 
                         thing.

                                     ED
                         My wife and I had not... performed 
                         the sex act in many years.

               Diedrickson stiffens.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                              (murmuring)
                         ...Jesus.
                              (aloud)
                         ...Well, that's not really my 
                         business.

               He is hastily digging for money.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.

               He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he 
               leaves:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Good luck, Crane.

               His retreating footsteps echo down the bar.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the 
               middle background, knocking on a door.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I had never really talked 
                         much. I don't think that's a bad 
                         thing, necessarily. But it was funny: 
                         now I wanted to talk--now, with 
                         everyone gone. I was alone, with 
                         secrets I didn't want and no one to 
                         tell them to anyway.

               The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.

               APARTMENT

               We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It 
               is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests 
               too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas 
               are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the 
               one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its 
               feeble light.

               Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across 
               from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of 
               the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration 
               as she mumbles.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I visited a woman who was supposed 
                         to have powers in communicating with 
                         those who had passed across, as she 
                         called it. She said that people who 
                         passed across were picky about who 
                         they'd communicate with, not like 
                         most people you run into on this 
                         side...

               The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Giff me your hant.

               Ed places his hand in the center of the table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so you needed a guide who they 
                         didn't mind talking to, someone with 
                         a gift for talking to souls...

               Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it 
               rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, first she told me that my 
                         wife was in a peaceful place, that 
                         our souls were still connected by 
                         some spiritual bond, that she had 
                         never stopped loving me even though 
                         she'd done some things she wasn't 
                         proud of...

               Ed looks up at the old woman.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She was reading me like a book.

               She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then she started talking about 
                         'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that 
                         and was there anything I wanted to 
                         tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just 
                         be telling it to the old bat. And 
                         even if somehow Doris could hear, it 
                         wouldn't be on account of this so-
                         called medium.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               Ed is leaving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She was a phony. Just another gabber.

               EXT. TENEMENT

               Ed emerges from the building.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, 
                         Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my 
                         back on the old lady, on the veils, 
                         on the ghosts, on the dead, before 
                         they all sucked me in...

               Ed disappears into the night.

               ABUNDAS HOUSE

               It is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter 
               Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the 
               side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is 
               murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, 
               glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand.

               Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets 
               the phone down and comes to the door.

                                     WALTER
                         Ed, how're you holding up?

                                     ED
                         I'm OK, Walter, thanks.

               Walter opens the door to him.

                                     WALTER
                         I'm so damn sorry about your loss. 
                         Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     WALTER
                         Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long 
                         distance here.

                                     ED
                         Sure, Walter. Thanks.

               PARLOR

               Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: 
               homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hello, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy.

                                     BIRDY
                         We haven't seen you since... I'm 
                         terribly sorry.

               Ed sits across from her.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     BIRDY
                         We've certainly missed you.

                                     ED
                         Birdy, I've been doing a lot of 
                         thinking. There are a lot of things 
                         that haven't worked out for me. Life 
                         has dealt me some bum cards...

               He is loading a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...or maybe I just haven't played 
                         'em right, I don't know. But you're--

                                     BIRDY
                         Pop doesn't like people smoking in 
                         here.

               Ed stares. This takes a moment to register.

                                     ED
                         Oh. Sorry.

               Birdy lowers her voice:

                                     BIRDY
                         Sometimes I have a cigarette in here 
                         when he's away. Never when he's in 
                         the house. He can smell it a mile 
                         off.

               Ed is pocketing the cigarette.

                                     ED
                         Sure... Sure, it's his house.

                                     BIRDY
                         That's what he keeps telling me.

               Ed smiles thinly.

                                     ED
                         Anyway, uh... my point is you're 
                         young. A kid really, your whole life 
                         ahead of you. But it's not too soon 
                         to start thinking... to start making 
                         opportunities for yourself. Before 
                         it all washes away.

                                     BIRDY
                         Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so 
                         too. I work pretty hard at school.

                                     ED
                         That's swell. However, the music, if 
                         you want to pursue it, well, the 
                         lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only 
                         take you so far. There's this guy in 
                         San Francisco, I've made inquiries, 
                         everybody says he's the best. Trained 
                         lots of people who've gone on to 
                         have big concert careers, symphony 
                         orchestras, the works. His name is 
                         Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure 
                         I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, 
                         he's a Frenchman.

                                     BIRDY
                         Boy.

                                     ED
                         You've got talent, anyone could see 
                         that. And he's the best. If he thinks 
                         a student has talent, he'll take 'em 
                         on for next to nothing. You're a 
                         cinch to be accepted, I could cover 
                         the cost of the lessons, like I said, 
                         it's pretty modest--

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, Mr Crane--

                                     ED
                         I have to do it. I can't stand by 
                         and watch more things go down the 
                         drain. You're young, you don't 
                         understand.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't 
                         really thought about a career or 
                         stuff.

                                     ED
                         I know you haven't. Look, just go 
                         meet him as a favor to me. I talked 
                         to this guy. Hope I pronounced his 
                         name right. He sounded very busy, 
                         but he's not a bad egg; he loosened 
                         up a little when I told him how 
                         talented you are. He agreed to see 
                         you this Saturday. He said maybe you 
                         were a diamond in the rough. His 
                         words.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Just see him, as a favor to me.

               STUDIO WAITING ROOM

               It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set 
               against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads 
               to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a 
               fast and difficult piece of music.

               Ed sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters 
               of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons.

               Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow 
               tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a 
               Junior Contour.

               Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch.

               The piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices. 
               Dull footsteps.

               The studio door swings open.

               A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette 
               ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a 
               knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and 
               settle on Ed.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...You are ze fahzer?

                                     ED
                         No. Uh... family friend.

                                     MAN
                         I am Carcanogues.

               He smiles at Birdy.

                                     MAN
                         ...You wait, my dear?

                                     BIRDY
                         Sure, Mr K.

               A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.

               STUDIO

               Ed enters, uncomfortable. He looks around, taking in the 
               high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano.

               Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         I speak to you on ze phone, non? You 
                         have a special interest in music?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah yes, a music lover.

                                     ED
                         Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah.

               He uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm, 
               tosses them back and washes them down.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Ah-hah.

               He twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his 
               mouth and lights it.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Mm.

                                     ED
                         Well? How'd she do?

               This elicits a Gallic frown of consideration.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ze girl?... She seems like a very 
                         nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, 
                         like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very 
                         nice girl. However, ztinks.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Is not so hard to understand. Her 
                         playing, very polite.

                                     ED
                         Did she make mistakes?

               Another gallic moue:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she 
                         plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the 
                         right note, always. Very proper.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand, no mistakes, 
                         she's just a kid--I thought you taught 
                         the, uh, the--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah, but that is just what I cannot 
                         teach. I cannot teach her to have a 
                         soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, 
                         is not about the fingers. *Done* 
                         with the fingers, yes. But the music, 
                         she is inside. Inside, monsieur...

               A two-handed gesture, indicating his heart.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...The music start here...

               He waggles his fingers:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...come out through here; then, 
                         maybe...

               His wave takes in the heavens:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...she can go up there.

                                     ED
                         Well, look, I don't claim to be an 
                         expert--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Then you listen to me, for I am 
                         expert. That girl, she give me a 
                         headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. 
                         Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, 
                         I think, maybe, she make a very good 
                         typist.

               DRIVING

               We are driving through the rural countryside of northern 
               California. It is a two-lane road with little traffic. Sun 
               strobes the car through the passing trees.

               Ed drives, glaring. Birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed, 
               ever cheerful.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I stank, didn't I?

                                     ED
                         He didn't say that.

                                     BIRDY
                         But more or less.

                                     ED
                         Look, I'm no expert, but--

                                     BIRDY
                         It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         I'm sure there's a dozen teachers 
                         better than this clown. More 
                         qualified. Goddamn phony.

                                     BIRDY
                         But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm 
                         not interested in playing music 
                         professionally.

               Ed looks at her.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I'm not certain I'll have a career 
                         at all, and if I do, I'll probably 
                         be a veterinarian.

                                     ED
                         ...Uh-huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         I do appreciate the interest you've 
                         taken, though.

                                     ED
                         Ah... it's nothing.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm only sorry that I didn't play 
                         better for you. I know it would've 
                         made you happy. You know what you 
                         are?

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         You're an enthusiast.

                                     ED
                         Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

               He loads a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...I guess I've been all wet.

                                     BIRDY
                         But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

               She reaches over to touch his thigh.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I wanted to make you happy.

                                     ED
                         Birdy--

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK...

               She is leaning over his lap.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I want to do it, Mr Crane.

               Ed is shocked:

                                     ED
                         Birdy!

               He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting 
               to be violent.

                                     ED
                         ...No, please.

                                     BIRDY
                         Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--

               The blare of an oncoming horn.

               Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on 
               the wheel.

               The oncoming car.

               Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams.

               CRASH: the car hits a roadside tree.

               BLACK.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Time slows down right before an 
                         accident, and I had time to think 
                         about things. I thought about what 
                         an undertaker had told me once--that 
                         your hair keeps growing, for a while 
                         anyway, after you die...

               A hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then 
               off the road, down an embankment.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and then it stops. I thought, 
                         what keeps it growing? Is it like a 
                         plant in soil? What goes out of the 
                         soil? The soul? And when does the 
                         hair realize that it's gone?

               We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head 
               resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom 
               down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we move 
               we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.

               The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright 
               revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it 
               disappears, leaving only black.

               FADE IN

               Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a 
               cigarette in the late afternoon light.

               A dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children 
               are playing somewhere up the street.

               Ed looks down at his watch. It is 5:30.

               Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway 
               stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat. He is a small 
               figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway.

               After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the 
               house, and jots something down.

               He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and 
               is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is 
               being watched. His manner instantly warms.

                                     MAN
                         Hello!

                                     ED
                         Hello.

               The man starts up the walk.

                                     MAN
                         I notice you still have peastone in 
                         your driveway.

               Yeah.

                                     MAN
                         Well, of course, you don't have to 
                         rejuvenate that once every couple of 
                         years, don't you, when the peastone 
                         thins out.

               Ed shrugs.

                                     MAN
                         ...Where does it go, huh? Like the 
                         odd sock. But you *know* where it 
                         goes--you probably pick pieces of it 
                         off your lawn all the time, churn it 
                         up with your lawn mower, sweep it 
                         off the walk here--pain in the neck.

               Ed shrugs again.

                                     ED
                         Doesn't bother me.

                                     MAN
                         Well, have you ever considered tar 
                         Macadam? People think it's just for 
                         public works and commercial purposes, 
                         roads, parking lots, so forth...

               A car pulls into the drive.

                                     MAN
                         ...but we have the technology now to 
                         bring it to the homeowner, the 
                         individual consumer, at a very 
                         reasonable price.

               Doris emerges from the car.

                                     MAN
                         ...Mind if I show you the 
                         specifications?--Evening, ma'am.

               Doris gives him a hard look.

                                     DORIS
                         What're *you* selling?

               The man gives a practiced laugh.

                                     MAN
                         Well, ma'am, I was just telling your 
                         husband here about tar Macadam, for 
                         your home driveway here--these are 
                         the specs...

               Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.

                                     MAN
                         ...It's the modern way to--

               Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.

                                     DORIS
                         Get lost.

               The man gazes at her. His smile fades fast and he and Doris 
               stare at each other, two hard cases.

               He turns stiffly and stalks off.

               Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well. She stalks up 
               the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front 
               door of the house, letting it slam behind her.

               Quiet, early evening.

               Ed sits, smoking.

               At length he rises and goes in to the house.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               It is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping 
               from the kitchen.

               Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around 
               a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set.

               With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the 
               couch.

               Ed sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray 
               closer on the coffee table.

               She sips. He puffs.

                                     ED
                         ...Doris--

                                     DORIS
                         Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

               The sit. The light is failing. The clink of ice cubes.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin. As 
               the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint, 
               distant:

                                     VOICE
                         Are you there? Are you awake?

               A blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolves 
               into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in 
               close.

               He leans away, murmuring:

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's coming around. Can you talk, 
                         sir? These men have to talk.

               Ed is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and one 
               side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life 
               support.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.

               Two police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in.

                                     PERSKY
                         Are you awake?... Is he awake?

                                     KREBS
                         Crane? We have to tell you, as soon 
                         as you're conscious--is he conscious?

                                     PERSKY
                         His eyes are open.

                                     KREBS
                         Uh... you're under arrest.

                                     PERSKY
                         As soon as the doctor lets us, we 
                         gotta move you. Does he understand 
                         that? We're supposed to tell him. 
                         Are you conscious?

                                     KREBS
                         You'll go to the prison hospital.

                                     PERSKY
                         Under arrest for murder.

               Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia:

                                     ED
                         Birdy... I didn't mean to--

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say?

                                     ED
                         Birdy...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. 
                         Broken clavicle.

               The doctor leans in.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...That's the collarbone, Crane. 
                         Broken. She's OK though.

                                     KREBS
                         So he understands? He's under arrest 
                         for murder?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave.

                                     PERSKY
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say? Does he understand?

                                     PERSKY
                         He said OK. Is that what he said?

               Krebs raises his voice:

                                     KREBS
                         You're under arrest for the murder 
                         of Creighton Tolliver! Do you 
                         understand?

               The voices are fading away:

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Does he understand?...

                                                                   FADE OUT

               UNDERWATER

               Light glimmers in water. We are drifting down, down, down.

               We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, waving 
               to keep himself submerged. It is a ten-year-old boy staring, 
               wide-eyed, at something in front of him. Bubbles 
               intermittently stream from his open mouth.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole 
                         outside of town had found his car...

               The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton 
               Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached at 
               only one corner, the rest of it waving free.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They'd winched it out...

               TRACKING

               We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated 
               men. The men rise.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and found he'd been beaten, just 
                         like Big Dave said--beaten to death...

               We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small 
               door behind his raised bench.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Inside the briefcase were the 
                         partnership papers I'd signed...

               The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on 
               the jury, now reseating itself.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...showing that I'd given him ten 
                         grand. For the district attorney...

               In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney 
               rises to read the charge. His voice plays distantly, muted, 
               the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...that made it fall into place: I'd 
                         gotten Doris to steal the money, the 
                         pansy had gotten wise somehow, and 
                         I'd had to kill him to cover my 
                         tracks. I was in a spot. I called in 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider...

               Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. As he 
               listens to the charge:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and signed the house over to him. 
                         He said he didn't ordinarily work 
                         that cheap, but he figured he owed 
                         me something since the last one hadn't 
                         played out...

               The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing 
               voice drops into the hole:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Not guilty, your honor...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I tried to tell him the whole story, 
                         but Riedenschneider stopped me. He 
                         said the story made his head hurt, 
                         and anyway he didn't see any way of 
                         using it without putting me on the 
                         hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

               Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he 
               sits next to him. Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one 
               leg.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told me not to worry, though, 
                         said he'd think of something, Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.

               JAIL

               We are tracking in on Ed, lying on the bunk in his cell.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They put me on twenty-four-hour 
                         deathwatch...

               A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked 
               chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice 
                         like they said my wife had done...

               COURTROOM

               The district attorney is rising again, this time to address 
               the jury.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But in front of the jury they had 
                         it that Doris was a saint; the whole 
                         plan had been mine, I was a Svengali 
                         who'd forced Doris to join my criminal 
                         enterprise...

               The district attorney is pointing at Ed.

                                     DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                         ...cynically used his own wife as a 
                         cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical 
                         cunning...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         On and on it went, how I'd used Doris 
                         and then let her take the fall. That 
                         stuff smarted because some of it was 
                         close to being true...

               The district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn to 
               Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of 
               him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking 
               inspiration for his own.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then it was Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider's turn.

               Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed 
                         a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked 
                         about how I'd lost my place in the 
                         universe...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...a puny player on the great world's 
                         stage...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...how I was too ordinary to be the 
                         criminal mastermind the D.A. made me 
                         out to be, how there was some greater 
                         scheme at work that the state had 
                         yet to unravel, and he threw in some 
                         of the old truth stuff he hadn't had 
                         a chance to trot out for Doris...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...who among us is in a position to 
                         say...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told them to look at me--look 
                         at me close. That the closer they 
                         looked the less sense it would all 
                         make, that I wasn't the kind of guy 
                         to kill a guy, that I was the barber, 
                         for Christ's sake...

               We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was just like them, an ordinary 
                         man, guilty of living in a world 
                         that had no place for me, guilty of 
                         wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, 
                         but not of murder...

               Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground 
               to point a finger directly at Ed's face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and 
                         if they voted to convict me, well, 
                         they'd be practically cinching the 
                         noose around their own necks. He 
                         told them to look not at the facts 
                         but at the meaning of the facts, and 
                         then he said the facts *had* no 
                         meaning. It was a pretty good speech, 
                         and even had me going...

               A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until Frankie interrupted it.

               Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor.

               A bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over 
               Ed, bellowing through tears:

                                     FRANK
                         What kind of man *are* you? What 
                         kind of man *are* you?

               Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's, 
               loudly protesting:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Move for a mistrial, your honor! 
                         Move for a mistrial! This outrageous 
                         display cannot help but prejudice...

               Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong 
               glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the 
               floor.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...and inflame the passions of these 
                         twelve fine men and women...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, he got his mistrial, but 
                         the well had run dry. There was 
                         nothing left to mortgage; 
                         Riedenschneider went home and the 
                         court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

               Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman 
               who enters the plea in the new trial:

                                     GARROWAY
                         Your honor, we plead guilty, with 
                         extenuating circumstances.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...who threw me on the mercy of the 
                         court. It was my only chance, he 
                         said. I guess that meant I never had 
                         a chance...

               The judge starts droning the sentence:

                                     JUDGE
                         ...a menace to society... a predator 
                         on his own wife, his business 
                         associates, on an innocent young 
                         girl... social contract... line 
                         crossed... the offender forfeits the 
                         right to his own life... I hereby 
                         order that you be taken to a place 
                         of confinement...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               We are tracking down the hall.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He wasn't buying any of that Modern 
                         Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, 
                         or any of the mercy stuff either. 
                         No, he was going by the book, and 
                         the book said I got the chair...

               Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, 
               hands clasped behind his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so here I am. At first I didn't 
                         know how I got here. I knew step by 
                         step of course, which is what I've 
                         told you, step by step; but I couldn't 
                         see any pattern...

               LATER

               Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now that I'm near the end, I'm 
                         glad that this men's magazine paid 
                         me to tell my story. Writing it has 
                         helped me sort it all out. They're 
                         paying five cents a word, so you'll 
                         pardon me if sometimes I've told you 
                         more than you wanted to know...

               Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister 
               publication Nugget lie on the little desk. Their lurid covers 
               depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and 
               AFTER TEN YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE, I DISCOVER I AM AN ESCAPED 
               LUNATIC.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But now, all the disconnected 
                         things seems to hook up.

               Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That's the funny thing about going 
                         away, knowing the date you're gonna 
                         die--and the men's magazine wanted 
                         me to tell how that felt...

               We hear a pulsing treble hum. Ed opens his eyes.

               The door to his cell is open.

               He rises and goes through the door.

               PRISON HALLWAY

               Ed, alone, walks down the hallway. The pulsing treble hum is 
               louder.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, it's like pulling away from 
                         the maze. While you're in the maze 
                         you go through willy-nilly, turning 
                         where you think you have to turn, 
                         banging into dead ends, one thing 
                         after another...

               PRISON YARD

               Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone 
               walls. A hard spotlight shines down from above. Ed squints 
               into it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But get some distance on it, and 
                         all those twists and turns, why, 
                         they're the shape of your life. It's 
                         hard to explain...

               The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer. We see its 
               revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of 
               its top bubble.

               After spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the 
               tremolo hum with it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But seeing it whole gives you 
                         some peace.

               Ed turns and re-enters the prison.

               ED'S CELL

               Ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind 
               his head. A hand enters to shake him awake.

               Three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing 
               a surplice and holding a bible.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The men's magazine also asked 
                         about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm 
                         sorry about the pain I caused other 
                         people...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               He is walking the last mile.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...but I don't regret anything. Not 
                         a thing. I used to. I used to regret 
                         being the barber.

               A door at the end opens:

               An electric chair. Straps open, and waiting:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I dont know where I'm being taken.

               Ed is placed in the chair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I don't know what waits for me, 
                         beyond the earth and sky. But I'm 
                         not afraid to go.

               A man stoops at his feet. He has a bucket of water and a 
               straight razor.

               He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch 
               of Ed's calf.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe the things I don't understand 
                         will be clearer there, like when a 
                         fog blows away...

               Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the 
               bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating 
               hairs.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe Doris will be there.

               They are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And maybe there I can tell her...

               The men withdraw.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...all those things...

               A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch. 
               As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...they don't have words for here.
"THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"

               Black.

                         Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But 
                         I never considered myself a barber...

               We track back from a barber's pole.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I stumbled into it--well, married 
                         into it more precisely...

               We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening 
               door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head 
               of a customer entering in slow motion.

                         ...I wasn't my establishment. Like 
                         the fella says, I only work here...

               We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, 
               aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The dump was 200 feet square, 
                         with five chairs, or stations as we 
                         call 'em, even though there were 
                         only two of us working...

               We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across 
               a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one 
               hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, 
                         was the principal barber. And man, 
                         could he talk...

               Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers 
               across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now maybe if you're eleven or 
                         twelve years old, Frank's got an 
                         interesting point of view, but 
                         sometimes it got on my nerves. Not 
                         that I'd complain, mind you. Like I 
                         said, he was the principal barber.  
                         Frank's father August--they called 
                         him Guzzi--had worked the heads up 
                         in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years 
                         until his ticker stopped in the middle 
                         of a Junior Flat Top. He left the 
                         shop to Frankie free and clear. And 
                         that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's 
                         ambitions: cutting the hair and 
                         chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk 
                         much...

               He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into 
               a tray.

                         ...I just cut the hair...

               LATE IN THE DAY

               The barbershop is empty of customers. Late sun slants in 
               through the front window. The two barbers--the narrator and 
               his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly 
               reading magazines.

                                     FRANK
                         Says here that the Russians exploded 
                         n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing 
                         we can do about it.

                         Uh-huh.

               Beat.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed?

                         Now, being a barber is a lot like 
                         being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's 
                         not much to it once you've learned 
                         the basic moves. For the kids there's 
                         the Butch, or the Heinie...

               We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...the Flat Top, the Ivy, the Crew, 
                         the Vanguard, the Junior Contour 
                         and, occasionally, the Executive 
                         Contour. Adults get variations on 
                         the same, along with the Duck Butt, 
                         the Timberline...

               Ed trims the fringe around a balding head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and something we call the Alpine 
                         Rope Toss.

               He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes 
               it across a bald pate.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I lived in a little bungalow on 
                         Napa Street. The place was OK, I 
                         guess; it had an electric ice box, 
                         gas hearth, and a garbage grinder 
                         build into the sink. You might say I 
                         had it made.

               We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as 
               a black coupe pulls into the driveway.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Oh yeah. There was one other 
                         thing...

               We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting 
               on a girdle.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Doris kept the books at 
                         Nirdlinger's, a small department 
                         store on Main Street. Unlike me, 
                         Doris liked the work, accounting; 
                         she liked knowing where everything 
                         stood. And she got a ten per cent 
                         employee discount on whatever she 
                         wanted--nylon stockings...

               Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to 
               the garter.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...make-up, and perfume...

               Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia 
               by Tuvache.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She wore a lot of perfume.

               Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee 
               table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster, 
                         was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the 
                         department store heiress. Tonight 
                         they were coming over for dinner--as 
                         Doris said, we were 'entertaining'...

               Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable 
               suit, smoking.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Me, I don't like entertaining.

               The doorbell rings.

               THE DOOR

               Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure, 
               bird-like wife.

                                     DAVE
                         How ya doin', Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK. Take your coat, Ann?

               DINNER TABLE

               The two couples are in the middle of the meal.

                                     DAVE
                         Japs had us pinned down in Buna for 
                         something like six weeks. Well, I 
                         gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it 
                         tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. 
                         *They* were eating grubs, nuts, 
                         thistles. When we finally up and 
                         bust off the beach we found Arnie 
                         Bragg, kid missing on recon; the 
                         Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if 
                         you'll pardon the, uh... And this 
                         was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' 
                         to write home about. I mean, I never 
                         would've, ya know, so what do I say, 
                         honey? When I don't like dinner, 
                         what do I say?

               Ann smiles wanly.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg--
                         *again*?!

               He roars with laughter.

               Ed gives an acknowledging smile.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!

               He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Were you in the service, Ed?

                                     ED
                         No, Dave, I wasn't.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed was 4F on account of his fallen 
                         arches.

                                     DAVE
                         Mm, that's tough.

               FRONT PORCH

               Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down. 
               Crickets chirp. From inside the house we hear laughter and 
               clattering dishes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all 
                         that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had 
                         the feeling that she and Big Dave 
                         were a lot closer than they let on...

               He turns and looks through the screen door into the house.

               Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly 
               lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the 
               counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter 
               while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing 
               dishes across.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The signs were all there plain 
                         enough--not that I was gonna prance 
                         about it, mind you. It's a free 
                         country.

               Footsteps approach the front porch.

               With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges.

                                     DAVE
                         Holding down the porch area?

               Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes, 
               forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front 
               lawn.

                                     DAVE
                         ...That's quite a wife you got there.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         She's a rare one.

                                     ED
                         How's business, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Couldn't be better. These're boom 
                         times in retailing. We're opening 
                         another store, Big Dave's Annex, 
                         there on Garson. This is strictly 
                         haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, 
                         ladies' foundations and undergarments. 
                         Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making 
                         Doris the comptroller. How're things 
                         at the, uh, the barbershop?

                                     ED
                         All right, I guess.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want 
                         to drop by the Annex when we open, 
                         update your suit--'course, you're in 
                         the smock all day.

               He chuckles.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Say, where do you get those things 
                         anyway?

                                     ED
                         Specialty store down in Sacramento.

                                     DAVE
                         Uh-huh.

               There is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big 
               Dave clears his throat.

               CHURCH

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I went to church once a 
                         week...

               We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting 
               the resurrection of Christ.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Usually Tuesday night...

               Faintly, we hear an amplified voice:

                                     CALLER
                         I... seven...

               Ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit 
               cigarette in his mouth.

                                     CALLER
                         ...Bee... Four...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris wasn't big on divine worship...

               Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of 
               her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and I doubt if she believed in 
                         life everlasting; she'd most likely 
                         tell you that our reward is on this 
                         earth and bingo is probably the extent 
                         of it...

               Still focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed:

                                     DORIS
                         Watch your card, honey.

                                     CALLER
                         I... sixteen...

               Ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from 
               his cigarette.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I wasn't crazy about the game, but, 
                         I don't know, it made her happy, and 
                         I found the setting peaceful.

                                     CALLER
                         Gee... nine...

               Doris sucks in her breath.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus, bingo--BINGO!

               BARBERSHOP

               Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. 
               Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, 
               a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the 
               vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I 
                         mean, if you're really serious. You 
                         tie your own flies, you do a--I know 
                         it's matickless, I know, people say, 
                         hey, you can buy flies at the store--
                         but you can buy your fish at the 
                         store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         The point is there's a certain art 
                         to the process. The point is not 
                         merely to provide, and let me point 
                         out, these fish are not as dumb as 
                         you might think.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Sportsmanship! That's my point. June 
                         fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? 
                         Well, what fish do you seek?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Sure, go to the store. Go there, 
                         describe to the man where you will 
                         be fishing, and for what, and the 
                         weather conditions, sun, no sun, 
                         whatnot, and so forth, and then you 
                         might as well have the man go ahead 
                         and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...

               We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows 
               at the far end of the shop. He is almost blown out by the 
               late-day sunlight hitting the window.

                                     FRANK
                         ...My point is, this is a man who 
                         knows nothing no matter how much you 
                         tell him, so sell him the goddamn 
                         FISH, Ed.

               The bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle-
               aged man walks in. He is well dressed--perhaps a little too 
               snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil 
               mustache.

                                     MAN
                         OK, boys, which of you gets the 
                         privilege?

                                     FRANK
                         We're just closing, friend.

                                     MAN
                         Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing 
                         well enough to turn away business! 
                         More power to ya, brother! The public 
                         be damned!

                                     FRANK
                         Hey, what's your problem, friend? 
                         This is a business establishment 
                         with posted hours--

               Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head.

                                     ED
                         I'll take care of him, go ahead, 
                         Frank. Have a seat, mister.

               Frank looks sourly at the stranger.

                                     FRANK
                         ...You sure, Eddie?

                                     ED
                         Yeah, yeah--go home.

               As Frank leaves:

                                     FRANK
                         In your ear, mister.

               The stranger chuckles.

                                     STRANGER
                         Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! 
                         Not so fast there, brother--

               Ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him 
               back; he lifts off a toupee.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the 
                         experts. 100 percent human hair, 
                         handcrafted by Jacques of San 
                         Francisco, and I'd hate to have to 
                         tell you what I paid for it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     STRANGER
                         Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for 
                         it down on the installment plan...

               Ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...A lot of folks live with the pate 
                         exposed. They say the dames think 
                         it's sexy. But for my money it's 
                         just not good grooming--and grooming, 
                         my friend, is probably the most 
                         important thing in business--after 
                         personality, of course...

               He twists around to offer his hand.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to 
                         know ya.

                                     ED
                         Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa 
                         Rosa?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         A goose, friend. I was chasing a 
                         wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard 
                         of venture capital?

                                     ED
                         Uh--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, it's the wildest goose there 
                         is. Risk money. Very speculative. 
                         Except, Ed, in certain situations, 
                         it's not, see? I thought I had a 
                         prospect here. Well, I make the haul 
                         up and this lousy so-and-so tells me 
                         his situation has changed--all his 
                         capital's gonna be tied up in 
                         expansion plans of his own. Thank 
                         you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! 
                         It's only the biggest business 
                         opportunity since Henry Ford and I 
                         can't seem to interest a soul!

                                     ED
                         That right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         It's called dry cleaning. You heard 
                         me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'--
                         wash without water, no suds, no 
                         tumble, no stress on the clothes. 
                         It's all done with chemicals, friend, 
                         and your garments end up crisp and 
                         fresh. And here's the capper: no 
                         shrinkage.

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         That's right! Dry cleaning--remember 
                         the name. It's going to revolutionize 
                         the laundry industry, and those that 
                         get in early are gonna bear the fruit 
                         away. All I need is $10,000 to open 
                         my first store, then I use its cash 
                         flow to finance another, and so on--
                         leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole 
                         chain. Well, me and a partner. 
                         Cleanliness, friend. There's money 
                         in it. There's a future. There's 
                         room to grow... Say, that's looking 
                         pretty good. Let's see it with the 
                         hairpiece on...

               BATHROOM DOORWAY

               It is evening. Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb 
               contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a 
               cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Dry cleaning...

               The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Was I crazy to be thinking about 
                         it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity, 
                         the real McCoy?

               Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...My first instinct was, no, no, 
                         the whole idea was nuts. But maybe 
                         that was the instinct that kept me 
                         locked up in the barbershop, nose 
                         against the exit, afraid to try 
                         turning the knob. What if I could 
                         get the money?

                                     DORIS
                         Honey?

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.

                                     DORIS
                         Shave my legs, will ya?

               Ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette 
               back in his mouth to free his hands. He picks up a bar of 
               soap and starts soaping the leg.

               He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor.

               The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark 
               bits of hair flecking the white foam.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was clean. No water. Chemicals.

               He shakes the razor in the tub. Shavings float away across 
               the soap-slicked water.

                                     DORIS
                              (absently, as she 
                              reads)
                         Gimme a drag.

               Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, 
               uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris 
               as she sucks.

               He brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to 
               his own mouth. She murmurs:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Love ya, honey.

               A DOOR

               We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into 
               laughter.

               A hand enters to knock.

                                     VOICE
                         Yeah, come in.

               The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves 
               sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. A tray of room-
               service dishes sits near him.

               He is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (into the phone)
                         OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

               He hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Oh, I thought you were the 
                         porter... Can I help you?

               Ed stands awkwardly by the door.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm, uh, Ed.

               The stranger's look does not show recognition.

                                     ED
                         ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at 
                         a disadvantage.

                                     ED
                         I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Jesus! The barber! I'll be a 
                         sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 
                         'Course--the barber.

               Ed nods, his smile faint and forced.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...I didn't recognize you without 
                         the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave 
                         something at the shop?

                                     ED
                         No. I might be interested in that, 
                         uh, business proposition--

               Creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and 
               arranges it on his head.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         You got the dough?!

                                     ED
                         I can get it, yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Come in, come in, siddown over there. 
                         Coffee?

                                     ED
                         No. I--tell me--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sure.

                                     ED
                         What's involved, aside from putting 
                         up the money? What're you looking 
                         for the partner to do?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want 
                         to keep tabs on your investment, of 
                         course, but I'm looking for a silent 
                         partner. I've done the research, 
                         I've contacted the vendors, the deal 
                         is set. I'm just looking for venture 
                         capital, friend. Disappear if you 
                         want, check in whenever you like--I 
                         want the dough; I don't take 
                         attendance.

                                     ED
                         And how do we share--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. 
                         You and me. Finance and expertise. 
                         So--you've got the dough then, do 
                         ya?

                                     ED
                         I'll have it in a week.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, I'll be damned. The barber! 
                         And I thought this trip was a bust. 
                         Well...

               He reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand 
               and hands Ed a glass.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...it just goes to show, when one 
                         door slams shut, another one opens. 
                         Here's to ya, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

               They both knock back the whiskey. Creighton leans back and 
               gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, 
               his hairpiece slightly askew.

               Ed stares back.

               After a beat, without taking his eyes of Ed, Creighton reaches 
               up and loosens his tie. An almost imperceptible wink.

               Ed stares.

                                     ED
                         ...Was that a pass?

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (hoarsely)
                         Maybe.

                                     ED
                         You're out of line, mister.

               Creighton throws up his hands apologetically.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         No problem!

                                     ED
                         Way out of line.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Right! Strictly business.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

               CLOSE ON TYPEWRITTEN NOTE

               It says:

               I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DORIS CRANE.  COOPERATE OR ED CRANE 
               WILL KNOW.  YOUR WIFE WILL KNOW. EVERYONE WILL KNOW. GATHER 
               $10,000 AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.

               A hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I sent it to Dave the next morning. 
                         And I waited.

               BARBERSHOP

               We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-old's crew 
               cut as clippers buzz its perimeter.

               Frank reads a magazine. The youngster reads a comic as Ed 
               works his head.

                                     ED
                         Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         Huh?

                                     ED
                         This hair.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah.

                                     ED
                         ...You ever wonder about it?

                                     FRANK
                         Whuddya mean?

                                     ED
                         I don't know... How it keeps on 
                         coming. It just keeps growing.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?

                                     ED
                         No, I mean it's growing, it's part 
                         of us. And we cut it off. And throw 
                         it away.

                                     FRANK
                         Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare 
                         the kid.

               Ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap.

                                     ED
                         OK, bud, you're through.

               The kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out 
               the door. Ed gives Frank a considering stare.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw 
                         it out in the dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the--

                                     ED
                         I'm gonna mingle it with common house 
                         dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the hell are you talking about?

               Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers.

                                     ED
                         I don't know. Skip it.

               EXT. ED'S HOUSE

               It is twilight. Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and, 
               cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk.

               Music filters out from the house.

               INT. ED'S HOUSE

               Ed walks though the living room, hands in his pockets. The 
               music emanates from a radio in the bedroom.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed?

               A track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her 
               hair. Her dress is half zipped at the back.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Gimme a zip.

               Ed walks over behind her.

                                     ED
                         Where you going?

                                     DORIS
                         Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I 
                         told you last week, for the Christmas 
                         Push.

                                     ED
                         Yeah, right.

               We are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, 
               the lowers it slightly. Her back blooms through the dark 
               fabric of the dress.

               He slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume 
               atomizer.

                                     DORIS
                         Come on, get ready. It's important.

                                     ED
                         Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.

                                     DORIS
                         Oh, don't be a grump.

               SALES FLOOR

               It is festooned with streamers.

               Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the 
               other bringing a cigarette to his lips.

               Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the 
               dance floor. Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms 
               over their knees.

               A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching, 
               his Adam's apple bobbing.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Wild, man!

               He goes out onto the dance floor. Ed, left by himself, gazes 
               across the floor.

               His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly 
               talking to Doris.

               Doris reacts angrily.

               Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris. He 
               glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation. 
               He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.

                                     VOICE
                         You in ladies' wear?

               The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at 
               the floor, snapping his fingers.

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Haven't I seen you up in ladies' 
                         wear?

                                     ED
                         I don't work here. My wife does.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Check out the rack on that broad in 
                         the angora.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               A hand is laid on Ed's shoulder. It is Big Dave; he leans in 
               to murmur:

                                     DAVE
                         Ed. Can I talk to you?

               BIG DAVE'S OFFICE

               Music from the party drifts in only faintly. The office is 
               built into a corner of the sales floor. It is dominated by a 
               large desk. A large window on the far side affords a partial 
               view of the floor.

                                     DAVE
                         Siddown. Siddown...

               Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. Dave fumbles 
               nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. He trims the end 
               of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel 
               grip.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Souveniered it off a Jap in New 
                         Guinea.

               He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags 
               up a chair to face Ed's.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I guess you're wondering what 
                         Doris was so hot about.

               The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the 
               window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave. Ed leans 
               forward for Dave to light his cigar.

                                     DAVE
                         ...These're Havanas. Romeo and 
                         Juliets. Private stock.

               Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Ed, I...

                                     ED
                         What is it, Dave?

               Dave breaks down, weeping. He buries his face in his hands, 
               the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his 
               hair.

                                     DAVE
                         Ed, I've been weak...

               His shoulders heave.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.

               Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been 
                         carrying on with a married woman. 
                         Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--
                         what is it they say?--the--the--the 
                         chickens are coming home to roost.

               Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, 
                         uh, that's not the worst of it. I 
                         got a note. A blackmail note. You 
                         know, come across or everybody knows.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, you know what that would do to 
                         me.

                                     ED
                         I guess it would be pretty awkward.

                                     DAVE
                         Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my 
                         keister! Hell, it's her family's 
                         store--*her* store. I serve at the 
                         indulgence of the goddamn ownership, 
                         Ed.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         I only work here! And the lady's 
                         husband would know... Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         How much to they want, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         $10,000! I don't know what to do, 
                         Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. 
                         Even though I know who the sonofabitch 
                         is.

                                     ED
                         ...You know... who *who* is?

                                     DAVE
                         The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. 
                         It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's 
                         a businessman from Sacramento. A 
                         goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope 
                         me into some crackpot scheme; I heard 
                         him out and then told him to go to 
                         hell. And the very next day, the 
                         very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed 
                         for the same amount.

                                     ED
                         Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, I guess he don't care that 
                         it's obvious.

                                     ED
                         Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--

                                     DAVE
                         He's staying at the hotel I've gone 
                         to with, uh, with the lady in 
                         question. Must've seen us.

               Big Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Thanks...

               He exhales with a long sigh.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         That's my capitalization on the Annex! 
                         *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. 
                         That's what I was just talking to 
                         Doris about, a way of getting the 
                         money from the store that we could 
                         hide from Ann.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn 
                         wife!

               He give a tearful chuckle.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Doris, she was pretty hot about 
                         that. God bless her. She doesn't 
                         know I'm telling you this--she's mad 
                         enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're 
                         the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm 
                         sorry I... I better get back to the 
                         party.

               He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his 
               face.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I look all right?

               PULLING ED

               He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room 
               lit only by spill from the party. It is the music department; 
               pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I 
                         knew the ten grand was going to pinch 
                         him where it hurt...

               Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. He takes 
               out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But Doris was two-timing me and I 
                         guess, somewhere, that pinched a 
                         little too.

               His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone 
               is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room.

               The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three-
               quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of 
               haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play.

               Ed listens. The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby.

               The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and 
               Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his 
               face.

               The piece ends.

                                     ED
                         That was pretty.

               The player turns, surprised. It is a young woman.

                                     ED
                         ...Did you make that up?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig 
                         van Beethoven.

               Ed nods recognition of the name.

                                     ED
                         That was quite something.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.

                                     ED
                         That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I know who you are, Mr Crane.

               His look shows surprise.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...My father used to take me with 
                         him when he got his hair cut. Walter 
                         Abundas?

               Ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls 
                         me Birdy.

                                     ED
                         Sorry, I just didn't remember.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, that's all right. You can't be 
                         expected to remember every skinny 
                         girl who comes in with her dad.

               Ed give a wry smile.

                                     ED
                         ...You don't like the music out there?

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. 
                         I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

               A woman calls sharply from offscreen:

                                     VOICE
                         Ed.

               He looks.

               Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat 
               over her arm, purse in hand.

               ED'S CAR

               Doris and Ed are driving home.

               Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at 
               the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     DORIS
                         Dave.

                                     ED
                         How's that?

                                     DORIS
                         Ahh...

               She waves angrily.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Money problems. He's thinking 
                         about canceling the Annex.

                                     ED
                         So?

                                     DORIS
                         *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               They ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

               STREET

               As the car roars past and into the distance.

               ANOTHER STREET

               It is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a 
               hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a 
               Packard and drives off.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Big Dave did it, though...

               Ed, sitting in his car, is watching.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sent a note telling him where 
                         to drop the money...

               HOTEL HALLWAY

               Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray 
               by the elevator.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and he did. He came across.

               Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and 
               pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag.

               He goes back to the stairwell.

               ANOTHER FLOOR

               Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks.

               The door swings open.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...

               Ed follows him into the room.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...You bring a check?

                                     ED
                         Cash.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Cash?!

               He gives Ed a look.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Usually we do this kind of thing 
                         with a bank draft. But cash--that's 
                         fine--it's all the same in the end--
                         dough's dough, huh?

                                     ED
                         Sure.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         I got the paperwork here. Partnership 
                         papers here, they reflect our 
                         agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I 
                         supply professional services, you 
                         supply the capital. I'll give you a 
                         receipt on the dough there, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Pretty straightforward, but I don't 
                         know if you wanna show this stuff to 
                         a lawyer--

                                     ED
                         It's OK.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to 
                         tangle it up and then you pay 'em to 
                         untangle it, what's the point?

               He perspires as he counts the money.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Just a second here, I'll give you 
                         a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, 
                         Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't 
                         talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm 
                         gonna call the place Tolliver's, 
                         after me, you know, I didn't think 
                         you were much interested in, uh--

                                     ED
                         That'll be fine.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...

               He wipes his brow, finishes counting.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Yeah, that's it. As per our 
                         discussion.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, there it is. Writ large in 
                         legal escriture, next step is--

                                     ED
                         Look, uh... Creighton...

               He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the 
               cigarette planted in his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...You're not gonna screw me on this?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a 
                         lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* 
                         cleaning, this is not some fly-by-
                         night thing here! I must say, I've 
                         been an entrepreneur for thirteen 
                         years and I've never--

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         And I've never been asked--Look, you 
                         want the dough back? You know who I 
                         am! You--

                                     ED
                         OK.

               Creighton mops his brow again.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?

               CAR

               Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth. Doris sits 
               next to him. Rural scenery slips by in the background.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The next day was Saturday. We were 
                         going to a reception for Doris' cousin 
                         Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner 
                         out near Modesto. Doris didn't much 
                         feel like going, and I didn't either, 
                         but, like she said, we had a 
                         Commitment.

               Doris gazes stonily out at the road. At length:

                                     DORIS
                         ...I hate wops.

               Ed gives her a brief glance. Doris glares at him.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What's so damn strange about that?

                                     ED
                         I didn't say a word.

               She looks back out at the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...*You* didn't have to grow up with 
                         'em.

               This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Family. Boy.

               BY A BARN

               Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled 
               with food.

               A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and 
               screams:

                                     CHILD
                         He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's 
                         ridin' Garibaldi!

               Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung 
               over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig. He slaps 
               at the pig's ass with a large straw hat.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         That was when she started drinking.

               Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine 
               from a water glass. Ed stands nearby.

               A large woman hugs Doris.

                                     WOMAN
                         How you doin', Doris, you been OK?

                                     DORIS
                         How're you, Constanza?

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And 
                         how you been, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Ed. How's a business?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Doris)
                         He's a barber, right? It's a good 
                         trade. So how come you got no kids?

               PICNIC TABLE

               A group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a 
               picnic table set out with pies in a row.

                                     VOICES
                         Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for 
                         Frankie!

                                     FRANK
                         No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!

                                     VOICES
                         No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!

               An old man stands by with a stopwatch.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Ready...

               He clicks the timer.

                                     OLD MAN
                         ...Go!

               Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the 
               line of blueberry pies.

               The other picnickers cheer them on.

               ELSEWHERE

               Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple 
               accepting congratulations.

               Doris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk:

                                     DORIS
                         'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn 
                         wonderful.

                                     ED
                         Congratulations, Gina.

                                     DORIS
                         Life is so goddamn wonderful, you 
                         almost won't believe it.

                         Honey...

                                     DORIS
                         It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, 
                         I'm sure.

               Ed tries to lead her away.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

               Doris calls back over her shoulder:

                                     DORIS
                         Congratulations on your goddamn 
                         cherries!

               As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Leggo my goddamn elbow.

               ELSEWHERE

               In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering 
               slowly, painfully, toward a tree. In his right hand he 
               clutches a trophy.

               When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against 
               it, leans forward, and vomits.

               CAR

               Late afternoon, driving home.

               Ed drives. Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring 
               lightly. Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to 
               his chest, eyes closed, murmuring:

                                     FRANK
                         I never wanna see another blueberry 
                         pie...

               Silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...I never even wanna hear those 
                         words.

               Doris moans.

               More silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Don't says those words, Ed.

               EXT. BUNGALOW

               It is twilight. Ed's coupe is parked in the driveway. He is 
               just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side 
               door. He pulls Doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris, 
               who has one arm draped around his neck. He helps her into 
               the bedroom and eases her onto the bed.

               He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her.

               Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face. She 
               is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with 
               perspiration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I'd met Doris blind on a double-date 
                         with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who 
                         was seeing a friend of hers from 
                         work. We went to a movie; Doris had 
                         a flask; we killed it. She could put 
                         it away. At the end of the night she 
                         said she liked it I didn't talk much. 
                         A couple weeks later she suggested--

               A harsh jangle from the telephone. Doris moans but does not 
               wake; Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the 
               phone.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE
                         Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to 
                         you.

                                     ED
                         What--now?

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

                                     ED
                         But it's...

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

               Ed sighs.

                                     ED
                         Your place?

                                     DAVE
                         I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself 
                         in.

                                     ED
                         OK.

               He hangs up.

               He nudges Doris.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She murmurs.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She rolls away and burrows into a pillow.

               Ed opens her purse and pokes through it.

               NIRDLINGER'S

               We are looking over Ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings 
               open a door.

               It reveals Big Dave's office, quiet and rather dark.

               A down-facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates Big Dave's 
               hands on the desktop.

                                     ED
                         ...Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Come on in.

               Ed enters, sits.

               An awkward silence.

                                     ED
                         ...What's the problem, Big Dave?

               Another silence.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm ruined.

               His hands writhe on the desktop.

                                     DAVE
                         ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. 
                         I'm all shot to hell.

                                     ED
                         So you paid the guy?

               Big Dave stares without speaking.

               After a long beat:

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     DAVE
                         What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave--

                                     DAVE
                         I'd understand if you'd walked in 
                         here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. 
                         I deserved it.

                                     ED
                         I, uh...

                                     DAVE
                         I'm not proud of what I did. But 
                         *you*.

               No one talks.

               Big Dave sighs.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. 
                         And then I went and found the pansy.

               He looks at Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, 
                         well, you already know the story. I 
                         didn't, I hadda beat it out of the 
                         pansy. *Your* money.

               No response.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave rises.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Well.

               He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly:

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm all shot to hell.

               Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him. 
               Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall.

               Ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave. Big 
               Dave wallops him in the stomach. Ed doubles over.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face 
               against the desktop. Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the 
               desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. He slams 
               him face-first into the window between the office and the 
               dark sales floor.

               Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against 
               the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat.

               Big Dave sweats and strains.

               A crack shoots up the pane of glass.

               Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's 
               neck.

               Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up to 
               his throat.

               Ed watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer.

               Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his 
               head twisted away.

               He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face-
               down onto the floor.

               Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees 
               but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knees 
               awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something 
               across the floor with his nose.

               He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself 
               in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through 
               the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him.

               Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. His 
               whole body shakes as he goes into shock.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into the 
               corner, face-down. He is still.

               The room is very quiet.

               Ed looks down at his hands.

               He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks 
               across the darkened sales floor.

               EXT. STORE

               Ed walks to his car. He does not look about, is not 
               particularly furtive. He gets into the car. He starts the 
               ignition.

               EXT. HOUSE

               He pulls up, sits motionless for a beat. Gradually, something 
               draws his attention; he cocks his head and looks up through 
               the windshield.

               A branch creaks and sways in the breeze.

               INT. HOUSE

               Ed gets into bed next to Doris. He stares at the ceiling. 
               Wind rustles outside.

               The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the 
               wind.

               He looks at Doris.

               Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth 
               is closed now, her breathing more peaceful. The leafy shadows 
               play over her face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was only a couple of weeks 
                         after we met that Doris suggested 
                         getting married. I said, Don't you 
                         wanna get to know me more? She said, 
                         Why, does it get better? She looked 
                         at me like I was a dope, which I've 
                         never really minded from her. And 
                         she had a point, I guess. We knew 
                         each other as well then as now...

               He is gazing at her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, well enough.

               Sound and image face.

               BARBERSHOP

               The next day.

               Ed cuts hair, a cigarette between his lips.

                                     FRANK
                         Holy-moly, do I got a headache.

               Frank is giving a haircut as well.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How you today, Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     FRANK
                         You don't got a headache?

                                     ED
                         ...Nah.

                                     FRANK
                         Damn, I got a headache to beat the 
                         band.

               LATER

               Ed sits in his chair, hands folded in his lap, head tilted 
               back, eyes closed.

               We hold on Ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and Frank talking 
               to someone in his chair.

                                     FRANK
                         Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it? 
                         That'll just flood it.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold 
                         it down. *That'll* flood it.

                                     FRANK
                         You crazy? You pumped it?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Well, ya can't hold it down.

               There is the jingle of the door bell. Ed opens his eyes.

               Two men in fedoras are entering.

               Ed starts to rise.

                                     MAN 1
                         Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Right.

                                     MAN 1
                         Come on outside.

                                     ED
                         Sure.

               OUTSIDE

               The two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant 
               to speak. One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker:

                                     MAN 2
                         ...So you're a barber, huh?

                                     ED
                         That's right.

                                     MAN 1
                         I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.

               Ed nods toward their car:

                                     ED
                         ...We goin'?

                                     KREBS
                         Huh? No.

               Beat.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Cigarette?

               Ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette.

                                     PERSKY
                         Right. Uh... Pete's got some news 
                         for you.

               His partner gives Persky a dirty look.

                                     KREBS
                         ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, 
                         but, uh... well damnit, your wife's 
                         been pinched.

                                     PERSKY
                         They sent us to tell ya.

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         They sent us to tell ya. We pulled 
                         the detail.

                                     ED
                         My *wife*?

                                     PERSKY
                         Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county 
                         jail, uh...

                                     KREBS
                         Homicide.

                                     PERSKY
                         Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A 
                         guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... 
                         He's the decedent.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     KREBS
                         He's the dead guy.

               Ed stares at him.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Yeah, it's a tough break.

                                     KREBS
                         Visiting ends at five. Too late today. 
                         You can see her tomorrow.

                                     PERSKY
                         Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.

               He shakes his head.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Crap detail.

               RESIDENTIAL STREET

               It is evening. Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined 
               street similar to his own. He gets out of his car and goes 
               up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a 
               hand of greeting.

                                     MAN
                         'Lo, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Walter.

               He steps up on the porch.

               The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks 
               as the swing moves. His skin glistens with drinker's sweat, 
               and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's 
               put at least a couple away.

                                     WALTER
                         Have a seat.

               Ed glances around but the swing is the only seat. He sits 
               next to Walter.

                                     ED
                         Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at 
                         home.

                                     WALTER
                         Oh, hell. Drink?

                                     ED
                         No thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Sure you don't need one?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine.

                                     WALTER
                         OK. Boy. Jesus!

                                     ED
                         Yeah. What do I, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of 
                         my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, 
                         probate, real estate, title search, 
                         uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, 
                         something like this. Absolutely 
                         worthless.

               He belches.

                                     WALTER
                         'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. 
                         Frankly, Doris'd be better off with 
                         the county defender.

                                     ED
                         He a good man?

                                     WALTER
                         Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I 
                         won't kid you though, Ed, nobody 
                         around here has any experience with 
                         this kind of, er... And I hear they're 
                         bringing a prosecutor up from 
                         Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking 
                         it seriously... Hmm...

                                     ED
                         So--

                                     WALTER
                         Taking it seriously.

                                     ED
                         So, who should I--

               The front door opens and someone speaks through the screen:

                                     VOICE
                         You want any coffee, Dad?

               Ed looks around at the voice.

                                     VOICE
                         Oh, hello, Mr Crane.

               She steps out: it is Birdy Abundas.

               Ed rises, and they awkwardly shake hands.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Rachel.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

                                     ED
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Coffee, Ed?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         No thanks, honey.

                                     BIRDY
                         OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.

               They watch her go back in.

                                     WALTER
                         Damnit! She's a good kid.

               Ed nods.

               A beat.

                                     ED
                         ...So, uh, who should I--

                                     WALTER
                         Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San 
                         Francisco. Probity--you know, no one 
                         ever said anything iffy about Lloyd 
                         Garroway. Conservative. Jury might 
                         like that. Might like that here.

               He takes a sip of his drink.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Probity.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, 
                         uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, the best, the money-is-no-object 
                         best, for a criminal case, any lawyer 
                         would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. 
                         Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't 
                         know how you're fixed for money.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. He's the, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Yeah, the best.

               He sniffs.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I 
                         could tell you more. Hell, I wish I 
                         could handle it myself. But I'd be 
                         absolutely worthless for this kind 
                         of thing.

               He takes a musing sip.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Criminal matter? Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider.

               He thinks.

                                     WALTER
                         ...No question about it.

               ED AT A TABLE

               It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides, 
               one side for prisoners, the other for visitors. The room is 
               empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across 
               from a younger woman at the far end of the table. The younger 
               woman, in a prison smock, is wailing. The elderly woman is 
               holding her hand.

               Ed sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed 
               toiletries kit. There are echoing voices suggesting large 
               spaces outside the room.

               He sits and waits.

               Approaching footsteps.

               The door opens. A large prison matron steps aside to let 
               Doris enter.

               Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big 
               for her. Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled. Not only is 
               she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on 
               her lip.

               As Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around.

                                     ED
                         Honey... I brought your make-up.

               She looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Honey.

                                     ED
                         How are you?

               She shrugs.

                                     DORIS
                         I don't know what's going on. I--

                                     ED
                         What happened to you?

               She shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...I don't know what happened to Big 
                         Dave. I know some of it. 
                         Irregularities in my books, they 
                         said. Can I explain it.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to--

                                     DORIS
                         I helped him cook the books, Ed. I 
                         did do that.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell them anything. 
                         We're getting you a lawyer.

               Doris doesn't seem to be listening. She sighs:

                                     DORIS
                         I know all about that. But I don't 
                         know how much to tell them.

                                     ED
                         Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting 
                         you Freddy Riedenschneider.

               Doris finally looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Should I... should I tell you why?

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell me anything.

               Her gaze drifts away again. She notices the sobbing woman.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus Christ.

               Doris looks around and laughs.

                                     DORIS
                         ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone 
                         could open them up, make sense of 
                         the whole goddamn store.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

                                     DORIS
                         I knew we'd pay for it.

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock. Frank 
               paces in front of him. He smacks a fist into his palm.

                                     FRANK
                         This is what family is for, Ed! This 
                         is when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons 
                         of bitches!

                                     ED
                         Frank, uh, you know I'll try to 
                         contribute, but, uh--Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider--

                                     FRANK
                         I don't care what it costs! This is 
                         when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         That's very generous.

                                     FRANK
                         The hell with it, Eddie!

               BANK

               Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby. 
               Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit. As they 
               wait, he looks nervously about.

               In a hushed voice:

                                     FRANK
                         They're just people like you and me, 
                         Ed. Remember that.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Just people. They gotta put up the 
                         big front so that people will trust 
                         them with their money. This is why 
                         the big lobby, Ed. But they put their 
                         pants on one leg at a time. Just 
                         like you and me.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite 
                         of appearances. And their money will 
                         be secured by the barbershop. A rock. 
                         A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, 
                         how long has *this* place been here?

               A door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle 
               age emerges.

                                     MAN
                         Mr Raffo?

               Frank hops to his feet.

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Could you come with me please?

                                     FRANK
                         Sure. Can Ed come too?

               The man looks dubiously at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         Mr...?

                                     ED
                         Crane. Ed Crane.

                                     MAN
                         You also have an interest in the 
                         securing property?

                                     FRANK
                         He's a barber.

                                     MAN
                         Ah.

                                     FRANK
                         Second chair.

                                     MAN
                         Not an owner.

                                     FRANK
                         No, he's family, he's my brother-in-
                         law.

                                     MAN
                         Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited 
                         here.

               He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank 
               trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, and 
               we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the 
               words lost.

               Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of 
               business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped 
               to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes 
               successive documents across his desk with a word of 
               explanation for each as Frank signs.

               Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The barbershop. Doris and Frank's 
                         father had worked thirty years to 
                         own it free and clear. Now it got 
                         signed over to the bank, and the 
                         bank signed some money over to Frank, 
                         and Frank signed the money over...

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               It is midday. We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a 
               long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb. A couple of 
               kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is 
               no doubt the fanciest in town.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who 
                         got into town two days later...

               Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a 
               restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that 
               obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spells 
               out "DaVinci's".

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and told me to meet him at 
                         DaVinci's for lunch.

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               Inside the restaurant. We are tracking toward a table whose 
               lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu 
               as he orders from a facing waitress:

                                     MAN
                         ...not fried, poached. Three of 'em 
                         for two minutes. A strip steak medium 
                         rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato 
                         juice, and plenty of hot coffee.

               He flips the menu over.

                                     MAN
                         ...Do you have prairie oysters?

                                     WAITRESS
                         No, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Then bring me a fruit cocktail while 
                         I wait.

               He looks up at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         ...You're Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Yeah--

                                     MAN
                         Barber, right? I'm Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell 
                         me the chow's OK here. I made some 
                         inquiries.

                                     ED
                         No thanks, I--

               The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of 
               Riedenschneider.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Look, I don't wanna waste your time 
                         so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind?  
                         *You* don't mind. So while I'm in 
                         town I'll be staying at the Hotel 
                         Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, 
                         it's goofy, the suites're named after 
                         operas; room's OK though, I poked 
                         around. I'm having 'em hold it for 
                         me on account of I'll be back and 
                         forth. In addition to my retainer, 
                         you're paying hotel, living expenses, 
                         secretarial, private eye if we need 
                         to make inquiries, headshrinker should 
                         we go that way. We'll talk about 
                         appeals if, as and when. For right 
                         now, has she confessed?

                                     ED
                         No. Of course not. She didn't do it.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! That helps. Not that she didn't 
                         do it, that she didn't confess. Of 
                         course, there's ways to deal with a 
                         confession, but that's good!--one 
                         less thing to think about. Now. 
                         Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. 
                         You should be there. Three o'clock. 
                         One more thing: you keep your mouth 
                         shut. I get the lay of the land, I 
                         tell *you* what to say. No talking 
                         out of school. What's out of school? 
                         Everything's out of school. I do the 
                         talking; you keep your trap shut. 
                         I'm an attorney, you're a barber; 
                         you don't know anything. Understood?

                                     ED
                         ...OK.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! Any questions give me a ring--
                         Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a 
                         message. You sure you don't want 
                         anything? No?

               He points a finger at Ed.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's 
                         OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.

               The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And the flapjacks, honey.

               DRIVING POINT OF VIEW

               We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the 
               windshield of a moving car.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         All going about their business. It 
                         seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger 
                         one even then what had really happened 
                         to Big Dave, something none of them 
                         knew...

               On Ed, driving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Like I had made it to the outside, 
                         somehow, and they were all still 
                         struggling, way down below.

               ED IN BED

               Arms folded behind his head, staring at the ceiling.

               On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb.

               A distant, muffled knock.

               Ed turns his head.

               FRONT DOOR

               Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe.

               The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black: a 
               black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her 
               bird-like frame.

               Wind rustles in the trees behind her.

               She stares at Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann.

               For the first time, we hear her speak, in a low, tremulous 
               voice:

                                     ANN
                         Hello, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann. Will you come in?

               She shakes her head.

                                     ANN
                         ...No, No, it's very late.

               Ed nods.

               After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues to 
               stare:

                                     ED
                         ...I'm so sorry about your loss.

                                     ANN
                         Yes. Thank you.

                                     ED
                         Of course, you know, Doris had nothing 
                         to do with it. Nothing at all.

               She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm.

                                     ANN
                         Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came 
                         to tell you...

                                     ED
                         Yes, Ann?

                                     ANN
                         And you should tell Doris...

               She falls silent. The trees behind her rustle.

               She gives a wary look back. Then, confidingly, to Ed:

                                     ANN
                         ...You know how Big Dave loved 
                         camping. And the out-of-doors.

               Ed is puzzled:

                                     ED
                         Yes?

                                     ANN
                         We went camping last summer. In 
                         Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, 
                         Ed.

               She gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he 
               will find this significant.

                                     ED
                         ...Yes?

                         At night, there were lights--we both 
                         saw them. We never told anyone, 
                         outside of our official report.

                                     ED
                         Ann--

                         A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. 
                         They led Big Dave onto the craft. He 
                         never told anyone what they did, 
                         outside of his report. Of course he 
                         told *me*. No one else.

                                     ED

                         it to you. But this thing goes deep, 
                         Ed. This was not your wife. I goes 
                         deep, and involves the government. 
                         There is a great deal of fear. You 
                         know how certain circles would find 
                         it--the knowledge--a threat. They 
                         try to limit it, and--

                         Ann, will you come in, sit down, 
                         maybe have a drink?

                                     ANN
                         Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. 
                         After this happened, things changed. 
                         Big Dave... he never touched me again.

               Ed says nothing.

               She touches his arm.

                                     ANN
                         ...Tell Doris not to worry. I know 
                         it wasn't her. Perhaps this will 
                         bring it out, finally. Perhaps now 
                         it will all come out.

               She turns and heads down the walk.

               Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk, 
               then are lost in the rustle of leaves.

               Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller.

               PRISON MEETING ROOM

               It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs. 
               One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight.

               Ed and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands 
               to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into 
               his pockets.

               All three are motionless for a long beat. Finally:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It stinks.

                         But it's true.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't care it's true, it's not 
                         true; it stinks. You say he was being 
                         blackmailed; by who? You don't know. 
                         For having an affair; with who? You 
                         don't know. Did anyone else know 
                         about it? Probably not; you don't 
                         know.

                                     ED
                         I knew about it. Big Dave told me 
                         about it, and the spot he was putting 
                         himself in by getting the money.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER

                         That's terrific.

               He starts pacing.

                         ...Like I say, it stinks.

               Another long pause.

                                     ED
                         ...I killed him.

               Riedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* 
                         killed him. How come?

                                     ED
                         He and Doris... were having an affair.

               Doris eyes him. His manner does not reveal anything.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         OK, how did you know?

                                     ED
                         I... just knew. A husband knows.

               Riedenschneider rolls his eyes.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone else say they knew?

                                     ED
                         I don't know. I don't think so.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         How did you get into the store?

                                     ED
                         I took Doris's keys.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone say they saw you there? 
                         On your way there? In there? On your 
                         was back?

                                     ED
                         ...I don't think so.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone corroborate and goddamn 
                         part of your story at all?

               Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare. Riedenschneider resumes 
               pacing.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Come on, people. You can't help 
                         each other like that. Let's be 
                         realistic now. Let's look at our 
                         options. Well, frankly, I don't *see* 
                         any options.

               A nod of the head indicates Doris:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...I cannot present Story A.

               Another nod indicates Ed:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...I cannot present Story B. I could 
                         plead you for a nutcase but you look 
                         too composed. I could offer a guilty 
                         plea and in return they don't give 
                         you the juice, but I don't think you 
                         want to spend the rest of your life 
                         in Chino and I know you didn't hire 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your 
                         hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell, 
                         you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway 
                         for that. No, we're not giving up 
                         yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, 
                         it means you're *not* throwing in 
                         the towel. I litigate, I don't 
                         capitulate. All right, no options, 
                         we gotta think. All right, we go 
                         back to the blackmail thing. It 
                         titillates, it's open ended...

               His pacing becomes more animated.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And it makes *him* the bad guy--
                         ya dig around, ya never know, 
                         something unsavory from his past, he 
                         approaches you to help with the money, 
                         it's too late, his past comes back 
                         to haunt him, who's to say...

               He is heading for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous 
                         husband thing, that's silly; we're 
                         going with the blackmail. I'll be in 
                         touch.

               The door slams.

               HOTEL LOBBY

               The camera drifts in toward the reception desk. Ed talks to 
               the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we 
               hear only Ed's narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Of course, there was *one* person 
                         who could confirm Doris's story, or 
                         plenty of it: the dry-cleaning 
                         pansy...

               The desk clerk is shaking his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But he'd left the hotel, skipped 
                         out on his bill...

               HALLWAY

               It is a rooming-house hallway. A stern middle-aged woman is 
               on the hall telephone. This too plays silently under the 
               narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He'd also disappeared from the 
                         residence he gave me...

               ED'S LIVING ROOM

               We are drifting in toward Ed, who nods at the telephone and 
               then cradles it. He stares down at the business card he holds.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...owing two month's rent. How could 
                         I have been so stupid. Handing over 
                         $10,000. For a piece of paper. And 
                         the man gone... like a ghost...

               PULLING BACK FROM ED

               In a different living room. He sits on a sofa, hands clasped 
               behind his head, listening. For the first time, as the voice-
               over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano 
               music.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...disappeared into thin air, 
                         vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki. 
                         Gone now. All gone. The money gone. 
                         Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could 
                         I have been so stupid?

               The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby 
               chair, also listening as Birdy plays.

               Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids 
               droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion 
               his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, 
               and he starts lightly to snore.

               BARBERSHOP

               The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at 
               the cut. Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs, 
               administering haircuts.

               The customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do 
               not hide rolls of fat. He has a hot towel over his face that 
               does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some 
               extent:

                                     CUSTOMER
                         She makes this stuff, she calls it 
                         gatto, it's got egg in there, it's 
                         got sugar, it's got--it's cake, 
                         basically, except she calls it gatto. 
                         Like if you don't call it cake maybe 
                         you won't put on any weight, like I 
                         need to eat gatto, you know what I'm 
                         saying? This stuff, if I've had a 
                         square meal, I've had my steak and 
                         potatoes, I can just have another 
                         cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask 
                         for the desert if it's not there...

               His voice turns into a drone under the narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Sooner or later everyone needs a 
                         haircut...

                         woman's magazine...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         We were working for the bank now. We 
                         kept cutting the hair, trying to 
                         stay afloat, make the payments, tread 
                         water, day by day, day by day...

               CRANE DOWN

               Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, 
               the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff 
               reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy 
               Riedenschneider.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Most people think someone's accused 
                         of a crime, they haul 'em in and 
                         bring 'em to trial, but it's not 
                         like that, it's not that fast. The 
                         wheels of justice turn slow...

                                     BAILIFF
                         ...did willfully and with malice 
                         aforethought take the life of one 
                         David Allen Brewster, a human being...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         They have an arraignment, and then 
                         the indictment, and they entertain 
                         motions to dismiss, and postpone, 
                         and change the venue, and alter this 
                         and that and the other. They empanel 
                         a jury, which brings more motions, 
                         and they set a trial date and then 
                         change the date, and then often as 
                         not they'll change it again.

                                     BAILIFF
                         What say you to these charges?

               Our boom down has ended close on Doris. We hear Freddy 
               Riedenschneider, off:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         We plead not guilty, your honor.

               Booming down toward the fat man.

                         And through all of it we cut the 
                         hair.

                         don't put a whole pan in front of me

               OPERA SINGERS

               We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in 
               character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, 
               dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths 
               of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. We 
               pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, 
               floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a 
               mask over his eyes, slumbers.

               RESTAURANT

               Tracking in toward Freddy Riedenschneider, who sits twirling 
               spaghetti with a fork against a spoon.

                                     ED (V.O.)

               LATERAL TRACK

               From inside a car. Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. Among 
               them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to 
               the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He'd brought in a private investigator 
                         from Sacramento...

               LATERAL TRACK

               Moving the opposite way. A different day, but again a crowd 
               moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man 
               scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his 
               hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring 
               his face.

               PUSHING IN TO ED

               In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy 
               at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I found myself more and more going 
                         over to the Abundas's. It was a 
                         routine we fell into, most every 
                         evening. I even went when Walter was 
                         away on his research trips. He was a 
                         genealogist, had traced back his 
                         side of the family seven generations, 
                         his late wife's, eight. It seemed 
                         like a screwy hobby. But then maybe 
                         all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found 
                         something there, in the old county 
                         courthouses, hospital file rooms, 
                         city archives, property rolls, 
                         registries, something maybe like 
                         what I found listening to Birdy play. 
                         Some kind of escape. Some kind of 
                         peace...

               The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but 
               then is snapped by a sharp clang.

               PRISON DOOR SWINGS OPEN

               We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room. 
               None of its three occupants is moving.

               The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table; the 
               private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped 
               back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his 
               fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between 
               his teeth; and Freddy Riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped 
               behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the 
               shaft of light that slants through the high window.

               A warder shuts the door behind Ed.

               Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance; 
               Riedenschneider does not.

               Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris, clasps his hands on 
               top of hers.

                                     ED
                         'Lo, honey.

               She looks at his hands on top of hers.

               A long beat.

               Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy 
               Riedenschneider announces:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...They got this guy, in Germany. 
                         Fritz something-or-other. Or is it. 
                         Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got 
                         this theory, you wanna test something, 
                         you know, scientifically--how the 
                         planets  go round the sun, what 
                         sunspots are made of, why the water 
                         comes out of the tap--well, you gotta 
                         look at it. But sometimes, you look 
                         at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya 
                         can't know the reality of what 
                         happened, or what *would've* happened 
                         if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn 
                         schnozz. So there *is* no 'what 
                         happened.' Not in any sense that we 
                         can grasp with our puny minds. Because 
                         our minds... out minds get in the 
                         way. Looking at something changes 
                         it. They call it the 'Uncertainty 
                         Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, 
                         but even Einstein says the guy's on 
                         to something.

               His gaze up at the window breaks. He strolls around the room, 
               still smiling.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Science. Perception. Reality. 
                         Doubt...

               He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin', 
                         sometimes, the more you look, the 
                         less you really know. It's a fact. A 
                         proved fact. In a way, it's the only 
                         fact there is. This heinie even wrote 
                         it out in numbers.

               He looks up at the private detective.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Burns?

               With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that its 
               front legs slap down onto the floor. He fishes a small 
               notebook from an inside pocket.

               His boredom is profound; his only concession to performance 
               is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the 
               other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.

                                     BURNS

                         beef, bar altercation--

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Yeah, yeah, couple of fistfights. Go 
                         to his service record.

               Burns looks at him sourly. He flips a couple of pages.

                                     BURNS
                         ...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned

                         capacity in US naval shipyards in

                         discharge May 8, 1945. Since then 
                         he's been clean.

               Riedenschneider nods, smiling.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Thank you, Burns, get lost.

               Burns pockets his notebook, adjusts his hat, jams his hands 
               into his pockets, and ambles out of the room.

               The slam of the door leaves quiet.

               At length:

                                     ED
                         ...So?

               Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         So? *So?!* This could be your dolly's 
                         ticket out of the deathhouse, so!

               Ed and Doris look at each other.

                                     ED
                         ...I don't get it.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Look, chum, this is a guy, from what 
                         I understand, told everybody he was 
                         a war hero, right? Island hopping, 
                         practically liberated the Pacific 
                         all by himself with a knife in one 
                         hand and a gun in the other and twenty 
                         yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         And now it turns out this dope spent 
                         the war sitting on his ass in some 
                         boatyard in San Diego. You asked for 
                         blackmail, let me give you blackmail: 
                         Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to 
                         open his own business here, has been 
                         lying to everybody in this town for 
                         the last four years, probably 
                         including half the people sitting on 
                         that jury. Well, it finally caught 
                         up with him--these dopes, it always 
                         does; someone threatened to spill 
                         it. Somebody knew his dirty little 
                         secret, just like your wife says. 
                         They called, they demanded money...

               He is looking at Doris.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Did Big Dave mention that it was 
                         something about his war service? I 
                         don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* 
                         have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, 
                         maybe he didn't; I'm not putting 
                         words in your mouth; the point is 
                         that this liar, this cynical 
                         manipulator, this man who through 
                         his lies sneered and belittled the 
                         sacrifice and heroism of all our 
                         boys who *did* serve and bleed and 
                         puke and die on foreign shores, and 
                         who made a fool out of this entire 
                         town, turns to *you* to help him out 
                         of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!

                                     ED
                         So... who... who actually--

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But 
                         the point is that if Mr Prosecutor 
                         over there had devoted half the time 
                         he's spent persecuting *this* woman 
                         to even the most cursory investigation 
                         of this schmoe's past, then we might 
                         *know* who! But we can't *know* what 
                         really happened! Because of Fritz, 
                         or Werner, or whatever the hell his 
                         name is! And because Me Prosecutor 
                         is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch 
                         who decided it's easier to victimize 
                         your wife! Because it's easier *not* 
                         to look! Because the more you look, 
                         the less you know! But the beauty of 
                         it is, we don't *gotta* know! We 
                         just gotta show that, goddamnit, 
                         *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. 
                         Science. The atom. *You* explain it 
                         to me. Go ahead. Try.

               He chuckles as he heads for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees 
                         daylight. We got a real shot at this, 
                         folks. Let's not get cocky.

               The door shuts behind him.

               Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.

               A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her 
               mouth.

                                     ED
                         Honey...?

               The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. 
               Ed frowns.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey?

               Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides 
               and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes 
               her head:

                                     DORIS
                         What a dope.

               ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM

               Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, 
               her eyes on the sheet music:

                                     BIRDY
                         He was deaf when he wrote this.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     BIRDY
                         Beethoven. He created it, and yet he 
                         never actually heard it. I suppose 
                         he heard it all in his head, somehow.

               Over her continued playing:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         So maybe Riedenschneider could get 
                         Doris off. Maybe it would all work 
                         out. And I thought--I hoped--that 
                         maybe there was a way out for me as 
                         well...

               A SIGN

               The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL / 
               PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949, 
               8:00 P.M.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The girl had talent, anyone could 
                         see that. And *she* wasn't some fly-
                         by-nighter, she was just a good clean 
                         kid...

               SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

               A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift 
               stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the 
               baby grand that has been set out center stage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...If she was going to have a career 
                         she'd need a responsible adult looking 
                         out for her...

               We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set 
               out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, 
               many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest 
               on Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...some kind of... manager. She'd 
                         have contracts to look at, be going 
                         on tours, playing on the radio maybe. 
                         I could help her sort through all of 
                         that, without charging her an arm 
                         and a leg, just enough to get by...

               Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience.

               EXT. SCHOOL

               Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm 
               summer night. He looks around the parking lot.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I could afford to charge less 
                         than the usual manager, not having 
                         to put up a big front like a lot of 
                         these phonies. And I could be with 
                         her, enough to keep myself feeling 
                         OK...

               A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, 
               laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another 
               student--a boy.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Why couldn't that work?... Why 
                         not?...

               Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's 
               drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hi, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy. I thought that was 
                         very good.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, in there? I messed up a little 
                         bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody 
                         noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is 
                         Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr 
                         Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Tony.

                                     TONY
                         Hello, sir.

               Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the 
               conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears 
               his throat.

                                     ED
                         ...Well, congratulations. I guess 
                         I'll be getting home.

                                     TONY
                         Nice to meet you, sir.

               TURANDOT SUITE

               It is morning. We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the 
               bathroom, where we hear water running.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking 
                         about in the days leading up to the 
                         trial. It seemed like once that was 
                         over, I'd be ready for a new start. 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider was very 
                         optimistic. He was busy preparing...

               We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider 
               hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water. 
               He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some 
               tonic in his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And finally it came... the first 
                         day of the trial...

               Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...What Riedenschneider called the 
                         Big Show.

               He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist.

               COURTROOM

               We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair. 
               He is sitting at the defense table.

               There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to 
               order.

                                     FRANK
                         Where's the judge? How come there's 
                         no judge?

               Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row 
               directly behind Riedenschneider.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Where's the judge, Ed?

               Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How come the judge doesn't come 
                         out?

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         The judge comes in last. He'll come 
                         in when Doris gets here.

                                     FRANK
                         So where's Doris? I thought we started 
                         at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's 
                         Doris?

               Riedenschneider is curt:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         She's late.

                                     FRANK
                         Late? How can she be late?

               Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* 
                         are in prison, and yet we're not 
                         late. We're on time, Ed. How can 
                         Doris be late? What, they don't have 
                         wake-up calls?

               The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's 
               bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters.

               The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down 
               and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his 
               desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider 
               and the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Counselors.

               Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his 
               counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leaning 
               forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible 
               from the gallery.

               The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones. 
               Frank leans in toward Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         What's going on, Ed? I thought there 
                         would be arguments. The bailiff, and 
                         so forth...

               Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly 
               stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider 
               looks back over his shoulder at Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed, what is this? Is this 
                         procedure?

               The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their 
               respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man 
               standing to one side.

                                     JUDGE
                         Bailiff.

               As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks 
               down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various 
               papers.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't understand... We had a real 
                         shot at it... We could have won this 
                         thing...

               The Bailiff Announces:

                                     BAILIFF
                         In the matter of the State of 
                         California versus Doris Crane, Case 
                         Number 87249 assigned to this Superior 
                         Court...

               As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It doesn't make any sense...

               BARBERSHOP

               Late afternoon sun slants in.

               The shop, not open for business, is very still. Ed, in his 
               courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line 
               the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees.

               Frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber 
               chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She'd hanged herself. I'd brought 
                         her a dress to wear to court and 
                         she'd used the belt. I didn't 
                         understand it either. At first I 
                         thought maybe it had something to do 
                         with me, that she'd figured out 
                         somehow how I fit into it and couldn't 
                         stand it, couldn't stand knowing...

               BEDROOM

               Night. Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That wasn't it, I would find out 
                         later. For now, everything just seemed 
                         ruined...

               METROPOLE LOBBY

               Riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind 
               him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back 
                         to Sacramento still shaking his head, 
                         saying it was the biggest 
                         disappointment of his professional 
                         career...

               FRANK'S HOUSE

               Day. Frank's kitchen.

               Frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown 
               over his pyjamas, unshaven.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect 
                         he was drinking; anyway, he stopped 
                         coming to work...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed, in his smock, works on a customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That left me to keep the place 
                         going, or the bank would've taken 
                         it.

               As he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between 
               his lips. He squints against the smoke drifting past his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...*I* was the principal barber now. 
                         I hired a new man for the second 
                         chair...

               Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a 
               gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I'd hired the guy who did the 
                         least gabbing when he came in for an 
                         interview. But I guess the new man 
                         had only kept quiet because he was 
                         nervous; once he had the job, he 
                         talked from the minute I opened the 
                         shop in the morning...

               EXT. BARBERSHOP

               It is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him 
               on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating 
               to illustrate his store.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until I locked up at night. For 
                         all I know, he talked to himself on 
                         the way home.

               STREET

               Ed walks along the sidewalk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...When *I* walked home, it seemed 
                         like everyone avoided looking at 
                         me...

               Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; their 
               averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...as if I'd caught some disease. 
                         This thing with Doris, nobody wanted 
                         to talk about it; it was like I was 
                         a ghost walking down the street...

               HOUSE

               As Ed lets himself in.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And when I got home now, the place 
                         felt empty.

               He sits on the couch and, after a beat, takes a cigarette 
               pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sat in the house, but there was 
                         nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't 
                         see anyone; no one saw me...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed is in his smock again, operating the clippers.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was the barber.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               The drone of the clippers has continued over the black. A 
               voice fades up:

                                     VOICE 1
                         So two blocks later I look at the 
                         change she gave me and, golly, I'm 
                         two bits short.

                                     VOICE 2
                         Two bits short.

                                     VOICE 1
                         So I walk back over to Linton's, 
                         find this gal--big argument; she 
                         doesn't even recall the transaction.

                                     VOICE 2
                         No recollection.

                                     VOICE 1
                         Doesn't recall the transaction, no 
                         recollection, so I said, Look, dear...

               FADE IN

               We are looking at a magazine story. Its headline, over an 
               illustration of a cresting wave, is: WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

               Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment 
               and racks of clothing on motorized tracks. Subheadlines read: 
               NEXT TO GODLINESS - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The 
               Thoroughly Modern Way To Clean.

               Ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs, staring at Life magazine. 
               The offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on 
               a customer.

                                     NEW MAN
                         ...go ahead, look at the menu, if 
                         you're in before six o'clock it's 
                         the, whatchamacallit, the--

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Early Bird Special.

                                     NEW MAN
                         What? Yeah, the Early Riser...

               Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph 
               of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in 
               the sky. The caption underneath: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.

                                     VOICE
                         Crane?

               Ed looks up.

               A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question 
               at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentarily 
               slackjawed.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm Crane.

                                     MAN
                         My name is Diedrickson. County medical 
                         examiner.

                                     ED
                         Yeah?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Just came for an informal chat...

               Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Why don't I buy you a drink?

               Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock, 
               addresses the new man, who still gapes.

                                     ED
                         Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?

                                     DWIGHT
                         Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your 
                         time.

               BAR

               It is late afternoon, dusty and empty.

               Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking 
               his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position.

               As the bartender approaches:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Rye.

                                     ED
                         Just coffee.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         You sure you don't want something 
                         stiffer?

               Ed shrugs and shakes his head.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Coffee it is.

               He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop 
               and stares at them. After a beat:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...County M. E. does an autopsy on 
                         anyone who dies in custody. I don't 
                         know if you knew that. It's routine.

               Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at 
               his hands, plows on:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Doesn't become a matter of public 
                         record unless there's foul play. 
                         However. I don't believe I'm 
                         *prohibited* from telling you this. 
                         I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, 
                         either. I don't exactly know.  But 
                         if *I* were the man, I'd want to be 
                         told.

                                     ED
                         Told what?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         I, uh... thanks.

               The bartender has set down the drinks.

               Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his 
               glass. Finally:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry to add to your burden, 
                         Crane, but I'd want to know it it 
                         was me. Your wife was pregnant. First 
                         trimester.

               A pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Well, there it is.

               Another pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry.

               He mutters to himself:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Hell, I hope I've done the right 
                         thing.

                                     ED
                         My wife and I had not... performed 
                         the sex act in many years.

               Diedrickson stiffens.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                              (murmuring)
                         ...Jesus.
                              (aloud)
                         ...Well, that's not really my 
                         business.

               He is hastily digging for money.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.

               He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he 
               leaves:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Good luck, Crane.

               His retreating footsteps echo down the bar.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the 
               middle background, knocking on a door.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I had never really talked 
                         much. I don't think that's a bad 
                         thing, necessarily. But it was funny: 
                         now I wanted to talk--now, with 
                         everyone gone. I was alone, with 
                         secrets I didn't want and no one to 
                         tell them to anyway.

               The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.

               APARTMENT

               We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It 
               is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests 
               too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas 
               are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the 
               one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its 
               feeble light.

               Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across 
               from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of 
               the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration 
               as she mumbles.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I visited a woman who was supposed 
                         to have powers in communicating with 
                         those who had passed across, as she 
                         called it. She said that people who 
                         passed across were picky about who 
                         they'd communicate with, not like 
                         most people you run into on this 
                         side...

               The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Giff me your hant.

               Ed places his hand in the center of the table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so you needed a guide who they 
                         didn't mind talking to, someone with 
                         a gift for talking to souls...

               Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it 
               rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, first she told me that my 
                         wife was in a peaceful place, that 
                         our souls were still connected by 
                         some spiritual bond, that she had 
                         never stopped loving me even though 
                         she'd done some things she wasn't 
                         proud of...

               Ed looks up at the old woman.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She was reading me like a book.

               She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then she started talking about 
                         'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that 
                         and was there anything I wanted to 
                         tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just 
                         be telling it to the old bat. And 
                         even if somehow Doris could hear, it 
                         wouldn't be on account of this so-
                         called medium.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               Ed is leaving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She was a phony. Just another gabber.

               EXT. TENEMENT

               Ed emerges from the building.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, 
                         Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my 
                         back on the old lady, on the veils, 
                         on the ghosts, on the dead, before 
                         they all sucked me in...

               Ed disappears into the night.

               ABUNDAS HOUSE

               It is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter 
               Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the 
               side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is 
               murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, 
               glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand.

               Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets 
               the phone down and comes to the door.

                                     WALTER
                         Ed, how're you holding up?

                                     ED
                         I'm OK, Walter, thanks.

               Walter opens the door to him.

                                     WALTER
                         I'm so damn sorry about your loss. 
                         Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     WALTER
                         Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long 
                         distance here.

                                     ED
                         Sure, Walter. Thanks.

               PARLOR

               Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: 
               homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hello, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy.

                                     BIRDY
                         We haven't seen you since... I'm 
                         terribly sorry.

               Ed sits across from her.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     BIRDY
                         We've certainly missed you.

                                     ED
                         Birdy, I've been doing a lot of 
                         thinking. There are a lot of things 
                         that haven't worked out for me. Life 
                         has dealt me some bum cards...

               He is loading a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...or maybe I just haven't played 
                         'em right, I don't know. But you're--

                                     BIRDY
                         Pop doesn't like people smoking in 
                         here.

               Ed stares. This takes a moment to register.

                                     ED
                         Oh. Sorry.

               Birdy lowers her voice:

                                     BIRDY
                         Sometimes I have a cigarette in here 
                         when he's away. Never when he's in 
                         the house. He can smell it a mile 
                         off.

               Ed is pocketing the cigarette.

                                     ED
                         Sure... Sure, it's his house.

                                     BIRDY
                         That's what he keeps telling me.

               Ed smiles thinly.

                                     ED
                         Anyway, uh... my point is you're 
                         young. A kid really, your whole life 
                         ahead of you. But it's not too soon 
                         to start thinking... to start making 
                         opportunities for yourself. Before 
                         it all washes away.

                                     BIRDY
                         Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so 
                         too. I work pretty hard at school.

                                     ED
                         That's swell. However, the music, if 
                         you want to pursue it, well, the 
                         lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only 
                         take you so far. There's this guy in 
                         San Francisco, I've made inquiries, 
                         everybody says he's the best. Trained 
                         lots of people who've gone on to 
                         have big concert careers, symphony 
                         orchestras, the works. His name is 
                         Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure 
                         I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, 
                         he's a Frenchman.

                                     BIRDY
                         Boy.

                                     ED
                         You've got talent, anyone could see 
                         that. And he's the best. If he thinks 
                         a student has talent, he'll take 'em 
                         on for next to nothing. You're a 
                         cinch to be accepted, I could cover 
                         the cost of the lessons, like I said, 
                         it's pretty modest--

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, Mr Crane--

                                     ED
                         I have to do it. I can't stand by 
                         and watch more things go down the 
                         drain. You're young, you don't 
                         understand.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't 
                         really thought about a career or 
                         stuff.

                                     ED
                         I know you haven't. Look, just go 
                         meet him as a favor to me. I talked 
                         to this guy. Hope I pronounced his 
                         name right. He sounded very busy, 
                         but he's not a bad egg; he loosened 
                         up a little when I told him how 
                         talented you are. He agreed to see 
                         you this Saturday. He said maybe you 
                         were a diamond in the rough. His 
                         words.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Just see him, as a favor to me.

               STUDIO WAITING ROOM

               It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set 
               against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads 
               to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a 
               fast and difficult piece of music.

               Ed sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters 
               of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons.

               Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow 
               tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a 
               Junior Contour.

               Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch.

               The piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices. 
               Dull footsteps.

               The studio door swings open.

               A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette 
               ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a 
               knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and 
               settle on Ed.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...You are ze fahzer?

                                     ED
                         No. Uh... family friend.

                                     MAN
                         I am Carcanogues.

               He smiles at Birdy.

                                     MAN
                         ...You wait, my dear?

                                     BIRDY
                         Sure, Mr K.

               A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.

               STUDIO

               Ed enters, uncomfortable. He looks around, taking in the 
               high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano.

               Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         I speak to you on ze phone, non? You 
                         have a special interest in music?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah yes, a music lover.

                                     ED
                         Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah.

               He uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm, 
               tosses them back and washes them down.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Ah-hah.

               He twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his 
               mouth and lights it.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Mm.

                                     ED
                         Well? How'd she do?

               This elicits a Gallic frown of consideration.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ze girl?... She seems like a very 
                         nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, 
                         like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very 
                         nice girl. However, ztinks.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Is not so hard to understand. Her 
                         playing, very polite.

                                     ED
                         Did she make mistakes?

               Another gallic moue:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she 
                         plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the 
                         right note, always. Very proper.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand, no mistakes, 
                         she's just a kid--I thought you taught 
                         the, uh, the--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah, but that is just what I cannot 
                         teach. I cannot teach her to have a 
                         soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, 
                         is not about the fingers. *Done* 
                         with the fingers, yes. But the music, 
                         she is inside. Inside, monsieur...

               A two-handed gesture, indicating his heart.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...The music start here...

               He waggles his fingers:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...come out through here; then, 
                         maybe...

               His wave takes in the heavens:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...she can go up there.

                                     ED
                         Well, look, I don't claim to be an 
                         expert--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Then you listen to me, for I am 
                         expert. That girl, she give me a 
                         headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. 
                         Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, 
                         I think, maybe, she make a very good 
                         typist.

               DRIVING

               We are driving through the rural countryside of northern 
               California. It is a two-lane road with little traffic. Sun 
               strobes the car through the passing trees.

               Ed drives, glaring. Birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed, 
               ever cheerful.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I stank, didn't I?

                                     ED
                         He didn't say that.

                                     BIRDY
                         But more or less.

                                     ED
                         Look, I'm no expert, but--

                                     BIRDY
                         It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         I'm sure there's a dozen teachers 
                         better than this clown. More 
                         qualified. Goddamn phony.

                                     BIRDY
                         But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm 
                         not interested in playing music 
                         professionally.

               Ed looks at her.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I'm not certain I'll have a career 
                         at all, and if I do, I'll probably 
                         be a veterinarian.

                                     ED
                         ...Uh-huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         I do appreciate the interest you've 
                         taken, though.

                                     ED
                         Ah... it's nothing.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm only sorry that I didn't play 
                         better for you. I know it would've 
                         made you happy. You know what you 
                         are?

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         You're an enthusiast.

                                     ED
                         Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

               He loads a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...I guess I've been all wet.

                                     BIRDY
                         But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

               She reaches over to touch his thigh.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I wanted to make you happy.

                                     ED
                         Birdy--

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK...

               She is leaning over his lap.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I want to do it, Mr Crane.

               Ed is shocked:

                                     ED
                         Birdy!

               He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting 
               to be violent.

                                     ED
                         ...No, please.

                                     BIRDY
                         Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--

               The blare of an oncoming horn.

               Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on 
               the wheel.

               The oncoming car.

               Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams.

               CRASH: the car hits a roadside tree.

               BLACK.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Time slows down right before an 
                         accident, and I had time to think 
                         about things. I thought about what 
                         an undertaker had told me once--that 
                         your hair keeps growing, for a while 
                         anyway, after you die...

               A hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then 
               off the road, down an embankment.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and then it stops. I thought, 
                         what keeps it growing? Is it like a 
                         plant in soil? What goes out of the 
                         soil? The soul? And when does the 
                         hair realize that it's gone?

               We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head 
               resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom 
               down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we move 
               we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.

               The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright 
               revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it 
               disappears, leaving only black.

               FADE IN

               Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a 
               cigarette in the late afternoon light.

               A dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children 
               are playing somewhere up the street.

               Ed looks down at his watch. It is 5:30.

               Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway 
               stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat. He is a small 
               figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway.

               After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the 
               house, and jots something down.

               He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and 
               is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is 
               being watched. His manner instantly warms.

                                     MAN
                         Hello!

                                     ED
                         Hello.

               The man starts up the walk.

                                     MAN
                         I notice you still have peastone in 
                         your driveway.

               Yeah.

                                     MAN
                         Well, of course, you don't have to 
                         rejuvenate that once every couple of 
                         years, don't you, when the peastone 
                         thins out.

               Ed shrugs.

                                     MAN
                         ...Where does it go, huh? Like the 
                         odd sock. But you *know* where it 
                         goes--you probably pick pieces of it 
                         off your lawn all the time, churn it 
                         up with your lawn mower, sweep it 
                         off the walk here--pain in the neck.

               Ed shrugs again.

                                     ED
                         Doesn't bother me.

                                     MAN
                         Well, have you ever considered tar 
                         Macadam? People think it's just for 
                         public works and commercial purposes, 
                         roads, parking lots, so forth...

               A car pulls into the drive.

                                     MAN
                         ...but we have the technology now to 
                         bring it to the homeowner, the 
                         individual consumer, at a very 
                         reasonable price.

               Doris emerges from the car.

                                     MAN
                         ...Mind if I show you the 
                         specifications?--Evening, ma'am.

               Doris gives him a hard look.

                                     DORIS
                         What're *you* selling?

               The man gives a practiced laugh.

                                     MAN
                         Well, ma'am, I was just telling your 
                         husband here about tar Macadam, for 
                         your home driveway here--these are 
                         the specs...

               Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.

                                     MAN
                         ...It's the modern way to--

               Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.

                                     DORIS
                         Get lost.

               The man gazes at her. His smile fades fast and he and Doris 
               stare at each other, two hard cases.

               He turns stiffly and stalks off.

               Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well. She stalks up 
               the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front 
               door of the house, letting it slam behind her.

               Quiet, early evening.

               Ed sits, smoking.

               At length he rises and goes in to the house.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               It is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping 
               from the kitchen.

               Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around 
               a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set.

               With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the 
               couch.

               Ed sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray 
               closer on the coffee table.

               She sips. He puffs.

                                     ED
                         ...Doris--

                                     DORIS
                         Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

               The sit. The light is failing. The clink of ice cubes.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin. As 
               the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint, 
               distant:

                                     VOICE
                         Are you there? Are you awake?

               A blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolves 
               into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in 
               close.

               He leans away, murmuring:

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's coming around. Can you talk, 
                         sir? These men have to talk.

               Ed is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and one 
               side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life 
               support.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.

               Two police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in.

                                     PERSKY
                         Are you awake?... Is he awake?

                                     KREBS
                         Crane? We have to tell you, as soon 
                         as you're conscious--is he conscious?

                                     PERSKY
                         His eyes are open.

                                     KREBS
                         Uh... you're under arrest.

                                     PERSKY
                         As soon as the doctor lets us, we 
                         gotta move you. Does he understand 
                         that? We're supposed to tell him. 
                         Are you conscious?

                                     KREBS
                         You'll go to the prison hospital.

                                     PERSKY
                         Under arrest for murder.

               Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia:

                                     ED
                         Birdy... I didn't mean to--

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say?

                                     ED
                         Birdy...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. 
                         Broken clavicle.

               The doctor leans in.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...That's the collarbone, Crane. 
                         Broken. She's OK though.

                                     KREBS
                         So he understands? He's under arrest 
                         for murder?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave.

                                     PERSKY
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say? Does he understand?

                                     PERSKY
                         He said OK. Is that what he said?

               Krebs raises his voice:

                                     KREBS
                         You're under arrest for the murder 
                         of Creighton Tolliver! Do you 
                         understand?

               The voices are fading away:

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Does he understand?...

                                                                   FADE OUT

               UNDERWATER

               Light glimmers in water. We are drifting down, down, down.

               We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, waving 
               to keep himself submerged. It is a ten-year-old boy staring, 
               wide-eyed, at something in front of him. Bubbles 
               intermittently stream from his open mouth.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole 
                         outside of town had found his car...

               The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton 
               Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached at 
               only one corner, the rest of it waving free.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They'd winched it out...

               TRACKING

               We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated 
               men. The men rise.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and found he'd been beaten, just 
                         like Big Dave said--beaten to death...

               We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small 
               door behind his raised bench.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Inside the briefcase were the 
                         partnership papers I'd signed...

               The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on 
               the jury, now reseating itself.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...showing that I'd given him ten 
                         grand. For the district attorney...

               In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney 
               rises to read the charge. His voice plays distantly, muted, 
               the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...that made it fall into place: I'd 
                         gotten Doris to steal the money, the 
                         pansy had gotten wise somehow, and 
                         I'd had to kill him to cover my 
                         tracks. I was in a spot. I called in 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider...

               Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. As he 
               listens to the charge:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and signed the house over to him. 
                         He said he didn't ordinarily work 
                         that cheap, but he figured he owed 
                         me something since the last one hadn't 
                         played out...

               The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing 
               voice drops into the hole:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Not guilty, your honor...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I tried to tell him the whole story, 
                         but Riedenschneider stopped me. He 
                         said the story made his head hurt, 
                         and anyway he didn't see any way of 
                         using it without putting me on the 
                         hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

               Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he 
               sits next to him. Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one 
               leg.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told me not to worry, though, 
                         said he'd think of something, Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.

               JAIL

               We are tracking in on Ed, lying on the bunk in his cell.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They put me on twenty-four-hour 
                         deathwatch...

               A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked 
               chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice 
                         like they said my wife had done...

               COURTROOM

               The district attorney is rising again, this time to address 
               the jury.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But in front of the jury they had 
                         it that Doris was a saint; the whole 
                         plan had been mine, I was a Svengali 
                         who'd forced Doris to join my criminal 
                         enterprise...

               The district attorney is pointing at Ed.

                                     DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                         ...cynically used his own wife as a 
                         cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical 
                         cunning...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         On and on it went, how I'd used Doris 
                         and then let her take the fall. That 
                         stuff smarted because some of it was 
                         close to being true...

               The district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn to 
               Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of 
               him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking 
               inspiration for his own.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then it was Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider's turn.

               Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed 
                         a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked 
                         about how I'd lost my place in the 
                         universe...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...a puny player on the great world's 
                         stage...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...how I was too ordinary to be the 
                         criminal mastermind the D.A. made me 
                         out to be, how there was some greater 
                         scheme at work that the state had 
                         yet to unravel, and he threw in some 
                         of the old truth stuff he hadn't had 
                         a chance to trot out for Doris...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...who among us is in a position to 
                         say...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told them to look at me--look 
                         at me close. That the closer they 
                         looked the less sense it would all 
                         make, that I wasn't the kind of guy 
                         to kill a guy, that I was the barber, 
                         for Christ's sake...

               We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was just like them, an ordinary 
                         man, guilty of living in a world 
                         that had no place for me, guilty of 
                         wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, 
                         but not of murder...

               Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground 
               to point a finger directly at Ed's face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and 
                         if they voted to convict me, well, 
                         they'd be practically cinching the 
                         noose around their own necks. He 
                         told them to look not at the facts 
                         but at the meaning of the facts, and 
                         then he said the facts *had* no 
                         meaning. It was a pretty good speech, 
                         and even had me going...

               A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until Frankie interrupted it.

               Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor.

               A bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over 
               Ed, bellowing through tears:

                                     FRANK
                         What kind of man *are* you? What 
                         kind of man *are* you?

               Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's, 
               loudly protesting:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Move for a mistrial, your honor! 
                         Move for a mistrial! This outrageous 
                         display cannot help but prejudice...

               Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong 
               glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the 
               floor.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...and inflame the passions of these 
                         twelve fine men and women...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, he got his mistrial, but 
                         the well had run dry. There was 
                         nothing left to mortgage; 
                         Riedenschneider went home and the 
                         court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

               Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman 
               who enters the plea in the new trial:

                                     GARROWAY
                         Your honor, we plead guilty, with 
                         extenuating circumstances.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...who threw me on the mercy of the 
                         court. It was my only chance, he 
                         said. I guess that meant I never had 
                         a chance...

               The judge starts droning the sentence:

                                     JUDGE
                         ...a menace to society... a predator 
                         on his own wife, his business 
                         associates, on an innocent young 
                         girl... social contract... line 
                         crossed... the offender forfeits the 
                         right to his own life... I hereby 
                         order that you be taken to a place 
                         of confinement...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               We are tracking down the hall.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He wasn't buying any of that Modern 
                         Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, 
                         or any of the mercy stuff either. 
                         No, he was going by the book, and 
                         the book said I got the chair...

               Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, 
               hands clasped behind his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so here I am. At first I didn't 
                         know how I got here. I knew step by 
                         step of course, which is what I've 
                         told you, step by step; but I couldn't 
                         see any pattern...

               LATER

               Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now that I'm near the end, I'm 
                         glad that this men's magazine paid 
                         me to tell my story. Writing it has 
                         helped me sort it all out. They're 
                         paying five cents a word, so you'll 
                         pardon me if sometimes I've told you 
                         more than you wanted to know...

               Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister 
               publication Nugget lie on the little desk. Their lurid covers 
               depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and 
               AFTER TEN YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE, I DISCOVER I AM AN ESCAPED 
               LUNATIC.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But now, all the disconnected 
                         things seems to hook up.

               Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That's the funny thing about going 
                         away, knowing the date you're gonna 
                         die--and the men's magazine wanted 
                         me to tell how that felt...

               We hear a pulsing treble hum. Ed opens his eyes.

               The door to his cell is open.

               He rises and goes through the door.

               PRISON HALLWAY

               Ed, alone, walks down the hallway. The pulsing treble hum is 
               louder.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, it's like pulling away from 
                         the maze. While you're in the maze 
                         you go through willy-nilly, turning 
                         where you think you have to turn, 
                         banging into dead ends, one thing 
                         after another...

               PRISON YARD

               Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone 
               walls. A hard spotlight shines down from above. Ed squints 
               into it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But get some distance on it, and 
                         all those twists and turns, why, 
                         they're the shape of your life. It's 
                         hard to explain...

               The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer. We see its 
               revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of 
               its top bubble.

               After spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the 
               tremolo hum with it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But seeing it whole gives you 
                         some peace.

               Ed turns and re-enters the prison.

               ED'S CELL

               Ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind 
               his head. A hand enters to shake him awake.

               Three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing 
               a surplice and holding a bible.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The men's magazine also asked 
                         about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm 
                         sorry about the pain I caused other 
                         people...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               He is walking the last mile.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...but I don't regret anything. Not 
                         a thing. I used to. I used to regret 
                         being the barber.

               A door at the end opens:

               An electric chair. Straps open, and waiting:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I dont know where I'm being taken.

               Ed is placed in the chair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I don't know what waits for me, 
                         beyond the earth and sky. But I'm 
                         not afraid to go.

               A man stoops at his feet. He has a bucket of water and a 
               straight razor.

               He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch 
               of Ed's calf.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe the things I don't understand 
                         will be clearer there, like when a 
                         fog blows away...

               Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the 
               bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating 
               hairs.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe Doris will be there.

               They are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And maybe there I can tell her...

               The men withdraw.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...all those things...

               A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch. 
               As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...they don't have words for here.

          1 EXT. MANHATTAN. BROADWAY. UPPER 70S. DAY. 1

          From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the
          curb. She steps off the curb toward us --
          A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened
          perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But
          the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to
          and fro through the frame.

          CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

          2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY. 2

          The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers
          step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first
          foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the
          mid-day work crowd crosses the street.

          3 EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY. 3

          MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all
          kinds, going all different ways, all over the city.
          CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags,
          walking among the crowds.

          4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4

          An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,
          one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive
          schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A
          sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.
          The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.

                         MR AARON
          Abrams... Allende...
          One after the other the students get up to collect their
          tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to
          their chairs.
          On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her
          class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly,
          somewhat bad-temperedly.

          MR AARON (CONT'D)
          Bernstein... Cohen...
          At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk.
          LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at
          her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic
          handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face
          as she reaches out her hand --

                         LISA
          Thank you, Mr Aaron.
          She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"

          5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER. 5

          AFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures
          for Lisa to take a seat.

                         MR AARON
          Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about
          your test for a minute.

                         LISA

                         (SITTING)
          Sure.

                         MR AARON
          Now...I know you had a little help...

                         LISA
          Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's
          what you mean.

                         MR AARON
          I'm just saying I know you had a little
          help.

                         LISA
          A lot of people did.

                         MR AARON
          Be that as it may --

                         LISA
          I mean I'll take it over again if you want,
          but like, what would be the point?
          It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need
          to know this stuff in my daily life...

                         MR AARON
          Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily
          true. Haven't you ever developed an 
          interest in something you didn't initially
          think you were going to develop an interest
          in?

                         LISA
          Um, no, not really.

                          
          Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa
          looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.

                         5 CONTINUED: 5

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big
          difference-between using a book and like, I
          don't know, using somebody else's mind
          who's like, really good at math? It's not
          like this person did the whole test for me.

                         MR AARON
          Oh no?

                         LISA
          No. I did some of it.
          She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.

                         MR AARON
          Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you
          did all of it. OK?

                         LISA
          You are so fair.

          6 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 6

          TRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past
          her fellow students. She walks through a door --

          7 EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 7

          -- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The
          walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY 
          and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby.

                         BECKY
          What did he say to you?

                         LISA
          Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an
          understanding about my math problem.
          Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          He is so appealing.
          A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier
          girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE.

                         KIRSTEN
          OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.

                         KURT
          What'd he do, call on you?

                         KIRSTEN
          Fuck you., Kurt.

          Kirsten is really upset.

                         KURT
          I'm sorry.

                         KIRSTEN

                         (TO LESLIE)
          Let me have one of those, will you?
          Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her.

                         BECKY
          Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.

                         KIRSTEN
          I don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie)
           Check out what he. said to me last week.
          She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa
          watches them.

                         LESLIE
          Are you serious?
          Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to
          some other girls seated on the steps.

                         MONICA
          .I just don't think you can really know a
          guy until you've slept with him.
          Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.

          8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8

           The class is taught by two teachers; MR KLEIN, 50s, and MR 
          LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words 
          "STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY."

                         KLEIN 
          .So the President of the United States,
          William B. McKinley, authorized the use of
          private detectives to break the strike, and
          they went out there and shot them down!
          Just like they did in Virginia, just like
          they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did
          not care! They did not care!

                         LEWIS
          (low, rumbling)
          And that's basically it-That's basically
          all there is to say.

                         KLEIN
          All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.

                         BECKY
          Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a
          good President of the United States?
          There is some laughter from the students.

                         KLEIN
          I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good
          question. What do you think? You. Lionel.
          What do you think? Did we ever have a good
          President?

                         LIONEL
          Um...I don't know. I guess most of them
          have just been totally corrupt.

                         - LEWIS
          Lisa?

                         LISA
          Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a
          big fan of all the Presidents of the United
          States, especially the current one, but I
          still don't think its necessarily all that
          useful to categorize every President as
          universally corrupt, because that just
          seems very general to me. Especially if
          you're going to judge them by the standard
          of -- whatever they're supposed to
          traditionally be like in some mythical
          version of America that probably never
          existed to begin with.
          ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.

                         ANTHONY
          Lisa has raised a salient point.
          There are some laughs from the class.

          9 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 9

          School is letting out. LISA walks away from the building. A
          short energetic kid named DARREN falls in step with her.

                         DARREN
          Hey, how'd you do?

                         LISA
          Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so
          much.

                         DARREN
          So he didn't give you a hard time or
          anything?

          Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go
          into Mathematics or anything...He was
          totally cool about it. He's so cool.

                         DARREN
          Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.

                         LISA
          What's that supposed to mean?

                         DARREN
          Nothing. The man is very lovable.
          They stop at the corner.

           - DARREN (CONT'D)
          What are you doing now?

                         LISA
          I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.

                         DARREN
          Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?

                         LISA
          Because my Dad is supposed to take me and
          my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to
          go horseback riding, and I don't think it
          would be right to appear on horseback in
          New Mexico without the appropriate
          equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You
          wouldn't understand these things.

                         DARREN
          That is a definite possibility.

                         LISA
          Anyway... Thanks again...

                         DARREN
          Before you venture forth on your bizarre
          quest for a cowboy hat...?

                         LISA
          Yes, Darren?

                         DARREN
          .what are you up to later? Like tonight.

                         LISA
          I don't know.

          No, not on a date, just go to amovie.
          I don't know if it's a fucking date!

                         LISA
          All right. Calm down. What do you wanna
          see?

                         DARREN
          I don't know, I don't even know what's
          playing! I don't know if it's a date!
          Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin'
          movies anyway. They're just bullshit.

                          
          They're all bullshit!

                         LISA
          OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm
          sorry!

                         DARREN
           What if it was a date, anyway? Would that

                          
          be so horrendous?

                          LISA 
           Oh my God. Are you like -- are you asking 
          me out? (Pause) Are you? (Pause) Hello...?
          Earth to Darren.

                          

                         DARREN
          I don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like
          we're already really close...

                         LISA
          Oh my God...

                         DARREN
          .and I think we'd be a really good match -
          - What?

                         LISA
          Nothing. This is -- Nothing.

                         DARREN
          So -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.

                          
          Yes I am.

                         LISA
          Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I
          would definitely not want to do anything to
          mess up our friendship.

                         DARREN
          I view this as a way of strengthening our
          friendship.

                         DARREN 
          I know: It's a fairly dangerous move. 

                         LISA 
          Well...I would definitely have to think 
          about this... 

                         DARREN 
          Absolutely. Give it some thought. 

                         LISA 
          OK, I will. 
          Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.

                         LISA (CONT'D) 
          Why do you look like that?

                         DARREN
          Like what?

                         LISA
          What do you want from me?

                         DARREN
          Not a thing!

                         LISA
          All right. I'll see you later.

                         DARREN
          All right.
          She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.

          10 EXT. LISA'S STREET -- WEST '80S. DAY. 10

           Lisa walks down her street and lets herself into the prewar 
          apartment building.

          11 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 11

          She lets herself into the narrow apartment. A long hall
          covered with framed pictures, photographs and play posters
          opens onto a cramped living room crammed with books, plays,
          and magazines. A stereo, TV and computer are stuck in the
          corners. Beyond this is the kitchen and another hallway
          leading to the bathrooms and bedrooms.

                         LISA
          Hello...!
          Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the
          refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in.

          Is Mom home?

                         CURTIS
          She went to the store.
          Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.

                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
          Use a plate.

                         LISA
          Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two-

                          CURTIS
          Fuck you.

                          LISA
          Please don't say "fuck," Curtis.

                         CURTIS
          You just said it.

                         LISA
          Yeah, that's because I know what it means.

                         CURTIS
          So do I.

                         LISA
          Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for
          it.

                         CURTIS
          What does it mean?
          She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.

                         LISA
          It's when a man puts his penis inside a
          woman's vagina and moves it around really
          fast until they both have an orgasm and he
          ejaculates sperm inside her body.
          Pause.

                         CURTIS
          No it's not.

                         LISA
          Yes it is.

          She eats. He watches her.

                         CURTIS
          Can I have some pizza?
           She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together.

           Curtis is practicing the piano. 

          12 INT. LISA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. 12

          Lisa, on her cell phone, rummages in her mother's bureau.
          During the following she finds a small supply of cash and
          steals forty dollars.

                         LISA
          (On the phone)
          What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: 
          Darren wants me to go to the movies with
           him. You want to come? I guess around
           eight?

          13 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 13

           POV LISA: slowly passing by Broadway clothing store windows.
           No cowboy hats. She walks down Broadway window shopping,
           enjoying herself.

          14 EXT. ANTIQUE CLOTHING STORE. DAY. 14

           Through the window, we see Lisa talk to the pretty, mid-20s 
           SALESGIRL with an embroidered cowboy hat.

          As Lisa slowly passes-by and looks in various store windows.
          She stops and looks at some shoes.
          REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, behind her, a city BUS pulls up to a
          bus stop and wheezes as the doors open.

          16 EXT/INT STREET/BUS. SIMULTANEOUS. 16
           The BUS DRIVER is wearing a cowboy hat. He is in his 30s and
          kind of good-looking. Past the disembarking passengers we see
          Lisa's back as she scans the shoe store.
          ON LISA -- She turns around and sees the Bus Driver. She sees
          his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut --

                         LISA

                         (TO DRIVER)
          Hey!
          The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it.
          IN THE BUS -- CLOSE on the Bus Driver, oblivious to Lisa, who
          we can see out the door and window, falling behind.
          ON THE STREET -- The bus falls behind a slow-moving car and
          Lisa catches up.
          IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and
          calling out. The Bus Driver sees her, smiles and waves back.
          ON THE STREET -- Lisa is running alongside the bus.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat?
          IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at
          her with good-natured flirtatiousness.
          ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW.
          THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the
          light.
          THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas.
          He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head
          and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it.
          The LIGHT turns RED.
          Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his
          head in a farewell salute as.--

          An Upper-West Side WOMAN, 40s or 50s (Later identified as
           MONICA PATTERSON) holding some grocery bags steps off the
          curb between two cars to cross Broadway.

                         VERY FAST:
          THE BUS DRIVER turns his head to look straight forward.
          POV BUS DRIVER -- Monica is directly in front of him.
          POV MONICA -- The bus roars up at her.
          THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES.
          POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled
          tumbling underneath.
          LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around.
          MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble.
          Everything stops.
          TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the
          accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking
          out from under the bus.
          Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is
          right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading
          everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak.
          She is making choking sounds.
          Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down
          and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where
          to put her hands. Other people start converging.
          IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the
          door and rushes out.
          WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already
          formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through
          till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA,
          holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several
          other people are shouting and talking all at once.

          YARDS AWAY the Bus Driver, very shaken, is giving his
          statement to another cop (MOS), but also trying to hear what
          Lisa is saying. Lisa keeps looking over at him.

          and Lisa gets a clear view of the woman's covered body.

          She sits on the bed and then gets up and looks at where she
          sat. There's an imprint of blood on the white bedspread.

                         JOAN
          What do you mean? Whose blood is it?
          What, happened?!

                         LISA

          NOTHING!
          Joan kneels down and tries to help her. Lisa screams and puts
          her arms around her mother and cries.

          21 INT. LISA'S ROOM. DAY. 21

          Lisa is putting on a bathrobe. Her hair and body are still
          matted and streaked with blood. Joan is picking up the bloody
          clothes and boots.

                         JOAN
          I don't know if I'm going to be able to get
          these clean again.

                         LISA
          Just throw them out.

          Let me see if I can get them clean.

                         LISA

                         (STARTS CRYING)
          Whv? Just throw them out!

                         JOAN

                         (GENTLY)

          OK.

          21A OMIT 21A

          22 INT. SHOWER. 22

          Lisa stands under the faucet letting the water take the blood
          out of her hair and-hands. She looks very young and little in
          the shower, little feet and face.

          23 INT. LISA'S ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS. 23

          O.C. we hear the shower. Joan scrubs at the bloody boots.

          24 INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 24

          Joan, Lisa and Curtis eat dinner. Lisa has combed wet hair.
          She is very subdued.

                         JOAN
          Does anybody know who she was?

                         LISA
          I don't know. I guess she lived around
          here. She had all these Fairway grocery
          bags.

                         CURTIS
          What did they do with her leg?

                         LISA
          I have no fucking idea.

                         JOAN
          Hey. Come on...

          25 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 25

          Lisa is getting made up to go out. Joan knocks and comes in.

                         JOAN
          Lisa? Are you sure you don't want me to
          call in...?

                         LISA
          Oh, no thanks Mom. I mean thank you:
          That's really sweet. But I'm supposed to go
          see Becky anyway.

                         (MORE)

          I don't really want to sit here thinking
          about it all night. Go to work. I'll be 
          alright.
          Joan doesn't look so sure.

          26 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - UPPER WEST SIDE. NIGHT. 26

          Darren, under the marquee, sees Lisa and Becky coming toward
          him. He's not happy to see Becky.

                         LISA
          Hey.

                         BECKY
          Hey, Darren.

                         -DARREN
          Hey.

                         LISA
          Did you get the tickets?

          27 INT. MOVIE THEATER. NIGHT. 27

          Lisa, Darren and Becky sit, the light from the movie
          flickering on their faces. Darren is mad. Becky is enjoying
          their discomfiture. Lisa is having trouble concentrating. She 
          gets up and walks out. Darren and Becky look at each other --
          not sure if she just went to the bathroom or left altogether.

          28 INT. THEATER. NIGHT. 28

          An upscale Off-Broadway theater. The cast is taking a curtain
          call. Joan, the lead, is in the middle.

          29 INT. JOAN'S DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. 29

          Joan is taking her stage makeup off. There's a knock.

          STAGEHAND (O.S.)
          Joan? You got some flowers.

                         JOAN
          Can you bring 'em in?

          30 INT. THEATER LOBBY. NIGHT. 30

          A very well-dressed, 55ish, interesting-looking man is
          waiting in the middle of the room. This is RAMON. He is
          watching Joan, across the room, say good-night to a group of
          friends and admirers.

                         JOAN
          Thank you guys so much for coming...! It
          was really great to see you...!

          Colombian accent.

                         JOAN (CONT'D)
          Hi -- are you Ramon?

                         RAMON
          Yes. Hello. You were wonderful -- again.

                         JOAN
          You're so sweet, thank you. And thank you
          for the beautiful flowers...!

                         RAMON
          Oh you're very welcome. I hope you didn't
          mind...

                         JOAN
          No, I'm very flattered. And you've seen the
          show before...?

                         RAMON
          Yes, two times.

                         JOAN
          Gosh. That's very -- That's a lot!

                         RAMON
          Oh no. It's a beautiful performance. And I
          think it's still in previews...?

                         JOAN
          Yeah, we're on kind of a weird schedule...

                         RAMON 
          I think you will have a big success.

                         JOAN
          Well, at the moment we're just trying to
          focus on what we're doing...

                         RAMON
          I don't know if you are busy, but will you
          allow me to -buy you a drink? There's a
          place right down the street... If you like
          to ask your friends... or if you didn't eat
          dinner...
          Joan sees Lisa sitting across the room waiting.

                         JOAN
          Oh -- No -- thank you. I can't. I'm just on
          my way home.

          It's a privilege to meet you. 

                          
          They shake hands. She heads over to Lisa as Ramon heads for
          the stairs to leave the theater.

                         JOAN
          I thought you were at the movies...!

                         JOAN
          I don't know. He sent me flowers.

                         LISA
          Go out with him.

                         JOAN
          You think?

                         LISA
          Um, yeah...!
           Ramon disappears up the stairs. Joan and Lisa look at each 
          other.

                          JOAN
           Hi, sweetie... !

                          LISA 
          She kisses and hugs Lisa, squashing her a little. Lisa gets
          a little tearful. Joan squeezes her tighter.

          31 INT. THEATER BAR/RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 31

          Lisa is out with Joan and some of the other actors from the
          show. They are laughing and having a good time.

          Joan does a very excellent Shirley Temple imitation.
          Everyone laughs. Lisa laughs and smiles proudly. Joan
          glances at Lisa, checking to see if this frivolity is really
          helpful or not such a good idea.

          32 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 32

          At the door, Lisa is ready to go to school. Joan, in a
          bathrobe, kisses her goodbye.

          Lisa goes out. We stay with Joan, who looks fretful.

          33 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 33

          Lisa walks down the street in SLOW MOTION. She passes
          through a gang of boys who hassle her as she goes by.

          34 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 34

          Still in slow-motion, she arrives at school. Becky, smoking
          outside, sees her and approaches, throwing away her cigarette
          as we resume normal camera speed.

          35 INT. HUMANITIES CLASS. DAY. 35

          Lisa sits in class dully. The class is reading paperbacks of
          King Lear. The teacher, JOHN, is a rather high-strung
          slightly harsh enthusiast with glasses and a beard.

                         JOHN
          Matthew, if you would read France... And
          Anthony, you read Burgundy...

          Ah. Burgundy.

                         JOHN
          And I guess I'm gonna hog the part of Lear
          again...

          36 INT. HUMANITIES CLASS. MOMENT LATER. 36

          John is walking back and forth, play in hand. The students
          are all reading along.

                         ANTHONY
          "Most royal majesty,
          I crave no more than hath your highness
          Offer'd, nor will you tender less."

                         JOHN
          "Right, noble Burgundy,
          When she was dear to us, we did hold her
          so; But now her price is fall'n."

          37 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE DINER. DAY. 37

           Lisa and Darren sit in the diner eating club sandwiches. Two
          NEIGHBORHOOD LADIES, 70s, sit in a booth nearby.

          told me that. You didn't need to bring
          Becky along as your bodyguard.

                         LISA
          I didn't bring her as a bodyguard.

          I guess I_don't think it's a very good

          Why not?

                         LISA
          I guess I don't feel that way about you.

                         DARREN
          But those kinds of feelings can develop. I 
          definitely feel like there's a connection
          there.

          I just think you're scared. I'think you're
          scared of your own feelings. I think you've
          been hurt in the past by other guys and I
          think what it would feel like to have a
          real feeling is really terrifying to you.

          Really. Wow. 

                         RAMON
          I grew up five years in Panama, four years
          in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After
          I finish university, I moved back to
          Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French,
          they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking
          Spanish, they think I'm french.

                         JOAN 
          And what do you do, Ramon? 

                         RAMON
          I have a company: We design computer
          software to help companies in South
          American countries.that use an incompatible
          software, so the computers can't talk to
          each other. It's a big problem in Central
          and South America, where there is not
          usually so much coordination in computer
          communications. So right now there's a big
          opportunity for us, because for the big
          software companies it's still in the
          backwoods. That's changing already, but in
          the last ten years we have done extremely
          well. It's the next ten years we're going
          to see what happens.

           Joan lies awake, restless. She starts masturbating. She kicks
           off the covers and hikes her nightgown up. Just as she's
           getting worked up there's a KNOCK on the door and it partly
           opens.

          I don't know, sweetie. I mean, that bus 
          driver probably has a family to support
          .He could probably lose his job...So I
          think you should really think about that
          before you say anything ... You might end up 
          feeling even worse... 
          Lisa was not expecting this response and doesn't like it.

          like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!

          They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to
          throw acid in women's faces!

          Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs --
          Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop
           bombs on the Ku Klux Klan?
          LISA Because they're white?
          Yes! No! The Taliban!
          Do you wish they were LIONEL

                         (TO LISA)
          But I'm not even saying I disagree with
          you! I'm only saying I think it's pathetic
          the way people in this class treated Angie
          just for saying something they don't agree
          with.

                         KLEIN
          Because that's censorship, right? Right?

                          MONICA LISA
          Yeah! (a joke:) Right on! It's not censorship...!
           This class is not the
           ANGIE government!
          Thank you... !

                          ANTHONY
           That's not technically LEWIS
          true. It's censorship.

          Yes.

                         MITCHELL
          OK, just describe what you saw to me in

          Lisa glances at Joan. Joan smiles at her encouragingly.

                         _ KARL
           OK. Well. I would actually seriously
           recommend you go over to, uh, to Claremont
           Stables and see about getting some lessons.

                          LISA 
           No, I was actually really thinking about 
          doing that...

           So how's everything going? How's school? 

                          LISA 
           School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in 
          geometry...

          it's not too serious... 

                          KARL 
           Yeah. Math was never my strong suit either. 

                          LISA 
           Well, I am definitely following in your 
           footsteps in that regard-How are you? 

                         KARL
          I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a
          little bit, which is good. How's the
          boyfriend situation?

                         LISA 
          Oh the same. They're all kind of the same.

          interesting people than you seem to be
          meeting at the moment.

                         LISA
          Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the
          California type.

                         KARL 
          Well -- I don't either, per se. It 

                          
          somewhat depends on who it is, obviously...

                         LISA

          OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe.

          Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I
          would be doing exactly what I'm doing right
          now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a
          cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the
          desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd
          just be acting, except I wouldn't do
          anything differently from how I'm doing it
          right now.

          the point where I now have to hear things
          about you from other people and I can't
          even correct them because I no longer have

          Nothing. I just feel like we used to be
          really close -- like, up until a few days
          ago. And I'm not really getting that from
          you anymore.

          because you always want to be symmetrical.
          Very important.
          She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and
          closes the vial. _

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
          Symmetry.

                         LISA
          You are so funny...! (Pause) So what do we
          do now?

                         PAUL
          Now we make out.

                         LISA
          Paul...! What about your girlfriend?

                         PAUL
          I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just
          asked me about my girlfriend.

                         LISA
          Oh, never mind...
          They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She
          pushes his hand away.

                         PAUL
          You're not serious.

                         LISA
          Oh... No.
          He moves his hand back. She lets him.

          60 INT. PARTY HOUSE -- STAIRWELL. NIGHT. 60

          Lisa comes down around the stairs at a mellow drunken pace.
          She sees Darren sitting by himself on the floor at the end of
          a dark hallway. She walks over' to him and crouches down.

                         DARREN
          Not really.
          Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.

                         LISA
          I guess I'm not very consistent.

                         DARREN
          I don't mind.
          He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.

                         - LISA
          I gotta go home.

          Joan sits on the toilet seat naked, smoking, hair tousled, a
          little overexcited. Ramon KNOCKS. She jumps.

          RAMON (O.C.)
          Joan? Are you all right?

                         JOAN
          Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec.
          She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror,
          tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door.

          Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa?

                         LISA
          Are you still mad at me about the test?

          .Because maybe my mother is right, and
          the bus driver is completely devastated as
          it is. And I'm just gonna be this little
          rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her
          conscience, and then ends up ruining
          somebody's life, when I'm the one who was
          distracting him in the first place.

                         MR AARON
           What does your being rich have to do with 
          anything? 

                          LISA 
           You know what I mean. 

           - MR AARON 
           No, I don't. 

                         LISA
          Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My
          Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like,
          every two years, and my Mom lives from
          like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich
          compared to the bus driver.

                         MR AARON 
          OK...But I still don't see what any of that 
          has to do with what you do or don't want to 
          tell the investigating officers about the
          accident you witnessed.

                         LISA
          Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're
          raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend
          to think about these things.
          Lionel and a girl open the door.

                         MR AARON
          Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.

                         LIONEL 
          I just thought you'd want to know there's
          like a lot of people out here and it's 
          getting kind of hard to breathe.

                         MR AARON
          You better close that door now, Lionel.
          Lionel closes the door.

          MR AARON (CONT'D)
          All right: I have to let those guys in.
          I don't want to leave you hanging...If
          you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup
          of coffee after school...

          66 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 66

          Lisa is watching TV. Joan comes in dressed for the opera.

                         JOAN
          Does this-make me look fat?

                         LISA
          Um, a little.

                         JOAN
          Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

                         LISA
          Where are you going?

                         JOAN
          The opera...!

                         LISA
          Why are you going to the opera?

                         JOAN
          It turns out he's a really big opera
          fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind
          of fun? We should all go sometime.

                         LISA
          Uh, no thanks.

                         JOAN
          Why not? I bet you'd like it.

                         LISA
          I don't like that kind of singing.

                         JOAN
          But you like classical music.

                         LISA
          Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera
          singing.

          But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason
          for existing is to prove how
          loud they can be. I don't
          really find that all that
          interesting.

                         JOAN
          Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not
          all like that. You like The Magic Flute.

                         LISA
          OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like
          opera singing. I just didn't realize it.

                         JOAN
          What is the matter with you?

                         LISA
          Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I
          don't want to go to the opera!

                         JOAN
          Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not
          pushing anything! All you have say is "No
          thanks!"

                         LISA
          I did! And then you were like, "Why not?"
          So then I told you, and then you started
          like, debating me! Like you assume I've 
          never thought this through for myself!
          Which I have! Many times!

                         JOAN
          OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous
          assumption on my part. I don't actually
          like the opera that much myself. But I'm
          trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's
          wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a
           little nervous about you guys meeting
          Ramon. 

                          LISA 
          Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so
          influenced by what me and Curtis think?
          What Curtis and I think.

                         JOAN
          Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody
          new it would important to me that you guys
          would like him and that he like you. Why
          wouldn't I be nervous about that?

                         LISA
          I guess you would. Withdrawn.

          me this whole conversation.

                         JOAN
          Go ahead: say something to LISA
          me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do
          to you the way you say that.
          everything to me -- Why not?

                         LISA

                         LISA
          Well, for someone who's supposed to be a 
          professional actress that's a pretty lame-
          ass impersonation of someone in your own
          family.
          Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.

          -- If you're really saying you're not aware
          that you've been really annoyed with me, or
          really irritable with me -- and it doesn't
          matter if_I express it exactly accurately:
          you know what I'm trying to say --!

          Not really.

                         JOAN
          if you're saying you're completely
          unaware of that, then I have to say I don't
          think you're being honest about it. Now
          maybe I'm doing something really horrible
          to you without being aware of it, but I
          have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very
          nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person
          and I'm obviously anxious about you and
          Curtis liking him -- whether you think I
          should be or not! -- you were involved in a
          horrible traumatic accident, you're going
          on this crazy horseback riding trip with
          your father --

                         LISA
          Oh my God!

                         JOAN

          to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa,
          ever since I told you about Ramon you've
          been treating me like I'm insane!

                         LISA
          Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.

                         JOAN

          dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb
          play, I don't frankly give a shit about

          to you! I don't care about New Mexico,

          the world than our relationship! There's a
          whole city out there full of people who are
          dying! So who cares if I like your fucking
          boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you

          Or should I have him wait downstairs...?

                         LISA
          Do whatever you want. I don't care! 

                         JOAN
          I don't even know what we're talking about.

                         LISA
          I know you don't. That's the problem.

                         JOAN
          Oh give me a break.

          67 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 67

          Ramon and Joan walk toward the Metropolitan Opera House.

                         RAMON
          Everything is all right?

                         JOAN
          Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the
          opera! I don't think I've really gone more
          than one or two times!

                         RAMON
          Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still
          fun to go.

                         - JOAN

                         (A JOKE:)
          What if we just went to see something else
          instead?

                         RAMON
          You don't want to hear Norma?

                         JOAN
          No -- I don't mean that. I just meant
          wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into
          one of the other events, like if we just
          went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play
          instead.

                         RAMON
          I think you will enjoy this.

          68 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA. NIGHT. 68

           Joan and Ramon sit in the audience listening to Norma. Joan
          leans in toward Ramon and whispers:

                         JOAN
          It's beautiful...!

                         RAMON
          (smiling at her)
          Shhh.

          69 INT. LISA'S ROOM/PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. 69

          Lisa dials a phone number off a slip of paper. The line
          rings. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

                         PAUL
          (answering the phone)
          Yo.

                         LISA
          Hey, Paul.

                         LISA
          It's Lisa Cohen.

                         PAUL
          Yeah, how's it going?

                         LISA
          OK. (Pause) What have you been up to?

                         PAUL
          Seeing some questionable movies. Not
          deciding where to go to college...

                         LISA
          Sounds good...(Pause) So...I was just
          thinking...This is gonna sound really
          queer, but...by any chance would you want
          to meet somewhere and like, take away my
          virginity?

                         PAUL
          Um...all right.

                         LISA
          Really? God, I'm so flattered.

                         PAUL
          To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?

                         LISA
          Actually it's because of my deep passionate
          feelings for you, Paul.

                         PAUL
          That's pretty much what I figured...(Pause)
          So, do you want to come over here? Should I
          come over there...?

                         LISA
          Well, my Mom just went out for the
          evening...Except my little brother's
          getting dropped off at some point, come to
          think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be
          here when he gets home.

                         PAUL
           All right. (Pause) Do you want to give me
           your address?

                          LISA
           (blushing almost to death)
          It's 252 West 85th Street...

          Darren lies on his bed, depressed. He dials the phone.

                         LISA
          (on the phone)
          Hello?

                         DARREN
          Hey. What are you up to?

                         LISA
          Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.

                         DARREN
          Really? That's impressive.

                         LISA
          Not really.

                         DARREN
          I've just never known you to be so devoted
          to your studies before.

                         LISA
          Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.

                         DARREN
          You're not gonna fail Humanities.

                         LISA
          No, probably not.

                         DARREN
          So what did you do tonight?

                         LISA
          Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like
          talking right now.
          Pause.

                         DARREN

          OK.

                         LISA

          OK?

                         DARREN
          Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

                         LISA

          OK.

          71 INT. HALL. NIGHT. 71

          Lisa, dressed up a little and wearing some makeup, opens the
          door for Paul. He's not dressed up at all. He's smoking.

                         PAUL
          Hey.

                         LISA
          Hey, come in.
          She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.

                         PAUL
          I think I-just alienated one of your
          neighbors by smoking in the elevator.

                         LISA
          Oh really? What did they say?

                         PAUL
          She basically said there was no smoking in
          the elevator.

                         LISA
          That's original...
          TRACKING them as they come into the living room...

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          So this is the living room.

                         PAUL
          Very livable.

                         LISA
          We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of
          these books, by the way.

                         PAUL
          Have you?

                         LISA
          Some of them. Not all of them.
          Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.

                         PAUL
          This book is a very cool book.

                         LISA
          Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a
          little bit too much for me right now.

          It's pretty hard to put down once you get
          started. -

                         LISA
          Do you want anything to drink?

                         PAUL
          I'd take a beer.

          72 INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 72

          Lisa has two beers out and is looking through drawers.

                         LISA
          OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener
          is. -

                         PAUL
          Here, lemme have them.
          He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter.
          He makes two marks in the counter doing this.

                         LISA
          Thanks.

                         PAUL
          Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged
          your kitchen counter. Sorry.

                         LISA
          Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it.

                         PAUL
          Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"

                         LISA
          How come everything you say always sounds
          so ironic? You don't even have to do
          anything and it just comes out sounding
          like, totally ironic and funny.

                         PAUL
          It's just a gift.
          She laughs nervously. They drink beer.

                         LISA
          So...do you want to see my room?

                         PAUL
          Sure.

          Very nice.
          She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.

                         LISA
          And these are my stuffed animals.

                         PAUL
          Always important to meet the stuffed
          animals.

                         LISA
          These are some drawings I did...Not that I
          should be showing them to you, because I
          know you're like a really good artist,
          right?

                         PAUL
          I would like to be a really good artist.
          At this point I think it would be more
          accurate to say I'm good at drawing.

                         LISA
          Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always
          really liked it...
          He looks at her pictures.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          So...can I ask you a question?

                         PAUL
          Yes?

                         LISA
          This is probably gonna sound very immature,
          but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what
          we're about to do? Or is it just like no
          big deal to you? (Pause) OK, that was a
          really stupid question and I'm like totally
          embarrassed right now. I'm actually more
          embarrassed than I've ever been in my life.
          If you want to go home now that's totally

          OK.

                         PAUL
          Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's
          basically like, the world's greatest

                          
          activity, but it's not actually worth
          getting nervous about.

                         LISA
          Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I
          think it's worth it: I usually get nervous
          because I can't help the way I feel.
          Although I do think that if anything is
          worth getting nervous about, it's this. But
          maybe that's just really idealistic of me.

                         PAUL
          There is that philosophy.

                         LISA
          You are so funny...!

                         PAUL
          Do you have an ashtray?

                         LISA
          Oh you can just chuck it out the window.
          Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette.
          He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          Are we starting?

                         PAUL
          I was thinking about it, yeah.

                         LISA
          And am I being really dorky right now?

                         PAUL
          You're not suave.

                         LISA
          I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous.
          Please ignore.

                         PAUL
          Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna
          be a great experience for you. You're
          gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms
          at least.
          He kisses her. They make out.

                         PAUL (CONT'D) 
          OK, let's talk about your kissing. Don't
          panic. It's just a technical thing.
          Lisa collapses with her face in the bed out of shame.

           It's dark. Their clothes are off, but we don't see much. She

                         LISA

                         PAUL
          Yeah, but we're gonna move on before

                         THAT-HERE:
          He shifts around and tries to go down on her.

                         LISA
          You don't have to do that.

                          

                         PAUL

                          
          I know. I want to.

                          
          Pause. She slides up away from him.

                          

                         LISA
          Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed.
          Let me do it to you.

                         PAUL
          All right.

          75 INT. LISA'S ROOM. LATER. 75

          He is positioning himself on top of her.

                         PAUL
          Are you ready?

                         LISA
          Yeah.

                         PAUL
          OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably
          gonna hurt a little, at first, but then
          it's gonna get better...Just be patient.
          There are certain technical difficulties on
          my end that have to be addressed or it's
          not gonna happen.

          They laugh.

                         PAUL
          OK, ready?

                         LISA

                         (SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED)
          Yeah.

                         PAUL

          OK?

                         LISA

                         (IN PAIN)
          Mm hm.

                         PAUL
          OK, hang on...

                         LISA
          Ow!

                         PAUL
          OK -- There we go. Does it hurt now?

                         LISA
          Kind of, yeah.

                         PAUL
          OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in
          a second...

                         LISA
          Did you bring a condom?

                         PAUL
          Uh huh...

                         LISA
          Shouldn't you put it on?

                         PAUL
          I will in a second.

                         LISA
          This is really kind of hurting.

                         PAUL
          OK -- one second.

                         LISA
          I love you.

          What?

                         LISA
          Nothing.

                         PAUL
          OK -- hold on -- Shit --

                         LISA
          What?

                         PAUL
          OK, one second -- Ohh! Sorry -- Sorry --
          He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
          Sorry about that. Kind of got away from me.

                         LISA
          Did any of it get inside me?

                         PAUL
          I don't know.

                         LISA

                         (FEELING AROUND)
          Yeah. It definitely did.

                         PAUL
          Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds
          are overwhelmingly that it's OK.
          O.C. the doorbell rings.

                         LISA
          That's my little brother.
          She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the
          whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          Hi, Curtis.

                         CURTIS
          Hi.
          We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has
          put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette.

                         PAUL
          Hey.

                         LISA
          Hey. (sits down) Can I have a drag? (takes
           a drag of his cigarette) Thanks.

          (gives it back to him) I'm actually kind of
          mad at you...

                         PAUL
          Why? (Pause) Why? (Pause) Because we didn't 
          use birth control?

                         LISA
          I guess so. 

                         PAUL
          It was at the ready...

                         LISA
          Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you
          know? And I really don't want to have an
          abortion, because I know when you have one
          at my age it, can be really hard to get
          pregnant later on, and I definitely want to
          have children some day.

                         PAUL 

                          
          Didn't you ever hear of the "Morning After

                          
          The Guy Came Too Fast Pill?"

                          

                         LISA
          Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill? 

                         PAUL 
          Well...that's the Canadian name. 

                         LISA
          Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals
          inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure
          it's fine...Or not...!

                         PAUL 
          Try to listen to me. Right about now is
          when you're traditionally supposed to freak
          out. So why don't you just not? You're not
          gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS --

                         LISA
          How do you know? Have you been tested?

                         PAUL
          No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it,
          because of my demographic. And the odds are
          you're probably not gonna have to have an
          abortion either. And since this was your
          first time, it might as well be a basically
          happy memory instead of a shitty one.

                         LISA
          I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of
          my emotions. (Pause) Anyway...Thank you for
          deflowering me.

          Did it freak you out that I said I love
          you?

                         PAUL
          No...It didn't freak me out.

                         LISA
          You don't have to say it back, because I
          know you probably have like no feelings at
          all for me.

                         PAUL
          I think I_just proved I have some feelings
          for you.

          Good! We should go again!

                         JOAN
          But how about those people yelling "Bravi!"
          and "Brava!"

                         RAMON
          How do you mean?

                         JOAN
          It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!"
          Why can't they just say "Bravo?"

                         RAMON
          Well, it's the plural.

                         JOAN
          I know --

                         RAMON
          It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they
          say to acknowledge the ensemble.

                         JOAN
          No, I know, I know it's correct, it just --
          don't you think there was something a 
          little pretentious about those people? 

                         RAMON
          Pretentious?

                         JOAN
          I don't mean they didn't really enjoy
          it...But you know how you can really be
          enjoying something -- but you're also kind
          of looking around out of the corner of your
          eye -- because you know people are watching
          you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at
          all?

                         RAMON
          Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was
          pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for 
          a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi"
          for the whole company.

                         RAMON
          You use the masculine for the male singer
          and the feminine for the female singer.

                         JOAN
          Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank
          you.

          Now I know there's been a lot of shit going
          on between a lot of the people in this
          room..But I wanna tell you something:
          You've worked too fucking hard for this
          show to be derailed now by the kind of
          bullshit I know has been going on around
          here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one
          person working on this show who hasn't got
          somebody they want to say something to,
          including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?

          You are probably one of the most talented
          kids who's ever performed at this school.
          But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you
          can just waltz through this part, and it's
          pissing me off. Because this show cannot
          come together until you learn your fucking
          lines. OK? _

                         MATTHEW
          So you'd like me to memorize them.

                         LISA
          Because of everything! 'Cause you always
          get such good grades and your family never
          has to worry about money, and your parents
          are still together, and I'm really jealous
          of your other friends!

                         BECKY
          Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!

          They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are
          not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes.

          Darren...?
          Darren unglues himself from his perch on a table, and sits in
          the circle with her.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          I know that I'm not who you want me to be
          to you. And I know how much I've hurt you.
          But I still can't believe it means we can't
          be friends anymore! So much has been
          happening to me this semester --

                         DARREN

                         (WITH UNDERSTANDING)
          I know. I know.

                         (IN TEARS)
          -- and it's like I can't even talk to
          you about it because I hurt you so bad!

                         DARREN
          Yes you can. Of course you can. You can
          talk to me about anything.

                         LISA
          I don't love anybody more than you!
          You're practically my best friend!

                         DARREN
          I love you too. I really do...!
          They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.

                         LESLIE
          Can I just say, I think this show is like
          two and a half seconds away from being
          fucking amazing, and if we could all just
          work together, instead of being AT each
          other all the time, I think we could all
          just be incredible.
          Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.

          Yeah. (Long pause) Yeah. I'm gonna say it.
          I feel really fucked over by some of the
          people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not
          gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot
          of the actors in this show seem to think
          that this whole show is about them. And I
          think I speak for a lot of the techies when
          I say that I feel really unappreciated and
          basically fucked over. And I don't know if
          I can get over it. I don't. That's all.
          Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty
          GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.

                         GARY
          Yes, Paul?

                         PAUL
          Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you
          know? This is hicrh school. You know? I
          don't really feel a strong need to like,
          all be on the same team with everybody.
          I just want to come to rehearsals, do the
          show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot,
          and then like, go on home. I don't really
          wanna cry and hug anybody.
          There are laughs and some cheers.

                         GARY
          Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you
          Paul?

                         PAUL
          OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug.
          No kissin' though.
          Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps.
          Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone
          is laughing.
          Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He
          sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa
          catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome
          gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.

          to get in touch with that woman's family?
          I'm obviously probably too late to go to

                         ABIGAIL
          I have been getting calls about this for
          three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave
          the police my number and all of a sudden I
          am the focal point for all these
          arrangements! And I gotta tell you people,
          I didn't have any kind of relationship with
          Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count
          the fact that she held up my children's
          inheritance for fifteen years. I guess
          we're just supposed to forget about all
          that now. And I am more than willing. But
          the perso n you should be calling is Emily
          Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is
          the person who has been dealing with all of
          this in New York. But it has nothing to do
          with me.

                         LISA
          I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to

          Now I can give you her number, but I would
          very much appreciate it if the calls would
          stop.

          Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get
          a pen?

                         THE MOURNERS
          Yes, thank you, Emily.

                         EMILY
          As you all know, Monica was not a religious
          woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through
          a wedding or a funeral with her knows how
          she felt about formal occasions. So Harry
          and Elise and I, when we were talking about
          this, decided we would just have everyone
          over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.
          about Monica just talk about her. Maybe
          share some remembrances of her. Some of us
          know each other, some of us don't. But
          we're all here because we loved Monica.
          (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And 
          because we want to pay tribute to her in a
          way that might conceivably not enrage her.
          Everyone laughs slightly.

                         EMILY (CONT'D)
          I don't want to tell anyone what to think,
          or how to feel. And I don't want to kid
          myself about the stupid, meaningless way
          she died, because it would really make her
          throw up. But I don't want it to become the
          summation of her life. Because it's not.
          When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can
          you stand it?" And she said. "First of all
          I can't. But I don't want to take away the
          twelve years she did have, and turn them
          all into leukemia. Because they weren't."
          So despite the fact that she got -- ripped
          off, I do think it's important to remember
          that Monica got a lot out of life. She was
          the most fully developed person I
          personally have ever known. She was also
          impossible to get along with, but that's
          another story.
          Everybody laughs. 

                          EMILY (CONT'D)
          As most of you know, she had more than her
          share of trouble over the years. But that
          never diminished her compassion or stopped
          her from embracing life to the absolute
          fullest -- measure.

          She sure did.

                         EMILY
          So. Now I've said my little piece. And now
          I want to talk a little bit about the first
          time we met. She was twenty one.
           Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence. 

                          WOMAN MOURNER
           It's OK, Emily.

                          EMILY
          I know...! (She waits) And I was nineteen! 
           Even though it's impossible for my children 
           to believe I.was ever that young. 
           Emily's college-age kids, a boy and a girl, smile warmly at 
          her from across the room.

          91 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT. LATER. DAY. 91

          Everyone is milling around. Lisa is talking to Emily.

                         LISA
          Emily, thank you so much for letting me be
          here.

                         EMILY
          Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to
          come by.

                         LISA
          Didn't she have any family?

                         EMILY
          No, she was the last one. Except for some
          cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail.
          She's the one who gave you my number...

                         LISA
          Yeah...

                         EMILY
          Well, she's a living nightmare. They never 
          got along at all.

                         WOMAN MOURNER
          Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so
          much for doing this.
          Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.

          Listen. I still can't believe this is
          happening...! (she starts crying) I mean 
          what the fuck is wrong with her? 

                         WOMAN MOURNER
          I don't know!

                         EMILY
          I don't understand why she didn't kill 
           herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and 
          then after all that with her mother, and 
          then her father, she gets hit by a fucking
          bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica.
          Always the worst luck. Always. (noticing
          LISA) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming.
          Please don't stand there staring at me, OK?

                         LISA
          (startled, embarrassed)
          I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.

                         EMILY
          It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're
          very sweet.

          That's a girl who was passing by at the
          time of the accident. She was right-there
          when she died, and she wanted to come to
          the funeral. I told her there was no
           funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I 
           wouldn't have done that at her age, would
           you?

           Lisa is on the phone.- The Times article about the accident is 

                          
           on her bed. O.C. we hear Curtis practicing his scales.

                          LISA 
           No -- M A R E T T I .. What about 
           Brooklyn? . Thank you. 

                          
           She writes down the number and hangs up. Looks at the number.

                          
          Dials the phone. It rings once. She hangs up.

          96 INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY. 96

          Lisa is very disengaged from the discussion. John is walking
          back and forth, reading aloud from King Lear.

                         JOHN

                         (READING)
          "We are to the gods as flies to wanton
          boys. They kill us for their sport."
          (Pause) We are to the gods as flies to
          wanton boys. They kill us for their sport."
          What do you make of that? Lisa? Lisa?

                         LISA
          I don't know.

                         JOHN
          Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare
          is saying about human suffering here?

                         LISA
          I don't know. Sorry.

                         JOHN
          You know what, Lisa? That's not good
          enough. That's not good enough.
          Shakespeare wrote something: What's your
          response? And don't tell me you don't have
          one because I don't buy it.

                         LISA
          I don't really have a lot to say. It seems
          pretty self-evident to me.

                         JOHN
          (Pause. Then:)
          Matthew?

                         MATTHEW
          I think it is self-evident. I think he's
          saying that human beings don't mean any
          more to the gods than flies do to little
          boys who like to torture them for fun.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          Like as far as the gods are concerned we're
          just ants. Nothing. (like a newscaster
          turning to his colleague) Darren?
          The class laughs.

                         DARREN
          (responding in kind)
          Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only
          it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's
          Gloucester. Maybe another character would
          have a different point of view.

                         JOHN
          OK: That's a valid point. Just because
          Shakespeare has one of his characters say
          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with
          it. Yes: David?

                         DAVID
          Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the
          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying
          there's a higher consciousness that we
          can't see. That the gods' perception of
          reality is so much more developed than ours
          that compared to their perception, our
          perceptions are like comparing flies to

                         BOYS

                         JOHN
          OK...I don't think that's what he's getting
          at...I think what he's getting at here is a
          very dark view of the arbitrary nature of
          human suffering.

                         DAVID
          But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing
          human consciousness to divine
          consciousness, and he's saying that even
          though it seems to us that human suffering
          is just arbitrary, that's just because
          we're limited by our viewpoint. 

                         JOHN
          Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test
          David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as
          flies to wanton boys. They kill us for
          their sport." I have to agree with Matthew,
          that seems pretty unambiguous.

                         DAVID
          Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher
          purpose that we can't see. He's saying that
          what seems like them killing us for sport
          could just be because our consciousness
          isn't developed enough to see what the
          higher wisdom of their killing us is.

                         JOHN
          OK, but -- I still don't think that's what
          he's trying to say. Um...

                         DAVID
          No, like if you say they kill us for their
          sport, when our perception of the gods is
          so meager that we can't even tell what
          they're doing, then how can we be so
          arrogant as to think that they would bother
          to kill us for their sport?

                         JOHN

                         (LOST)
          I don't know ...Um -- Monica?

                         MONICA
          I don't think that's what he's saying at
          all. I think he's saying the gods don't
          give a shit about human beings and they
          just kill and torture us for fun --

                         MATTHEW
          Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys.
          Anybody? Anybody?

                         MONICA
          Yeah...1

                         DAVID
          But if the gods' consciousness is so much
          more developed than ours that we seem like
          flies to them, then how can we be sure what
          they have in mind for us or why they do
          anything?

                         JOHN
          David, I think you've made your point.
          But it's not what Shakespeare meant.
          Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that
          he's trying to say something about
          human suffering here --

                         DAVID
          Scholarly opinion...:

                         JOHN
          And in this particular play what I think
          he's trying to say is pretty black --
          pretty bleak --

                         DAVID
          But what are you saying? A thousand
          Frenchmen can't be wrong?

          No, I'm not saying that. But I would
          like to move on --

                         DAVID
          I think he is saying that, because he's
          comparing human consciousness to flies, and
          he's saying that we can't see the truth
          around us because our consciousness is
          undeveloped.

                         JOHN
          No David, that's not what Shakespeare
          meant! He says it somewhere else in the
          play, but I don't want to get hung up on
          this any more because it's not what
          Shakespeare meant, and I would really like
           to move on.

          Well -- I'm hoping you're not too mature. 

                         LISA 
          No...Don't worry. 

                         KARL 
          OK good. That was a good answer,. 

                         LISA 
          Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- 
          standing relationship... 

                         KARL
          OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You
          do absolutely nothing. And one of two
          things will happen. Either he's gonna start
          doing back flips to get your attention, or
          you're gonna send him a crystal clear
          signal that if he doesn't do back flips
          he's not gonna get your attention. OK?

                         LISA 
          Well, I think he already knows I like him. 

                         KARL 
          Uh huh? OK... 

                         LISA 
          .I think I might have spilled the 
          beans on that one a little -- 

                         KARL
          That's OK. Because now, if now you stop
          acknowledging him, you just suddenly give
          him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless
          he's just not interested. In which case,
          you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is
          tough.

                         LISA 
          Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out 
          the technique next time I see him.

          OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you
          told me. Second of all, I think you should
          let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just
          to get some idea of what the ramifications
          would be.

          you didn't. So then I called her, and she
          never called me back. So what do you want
          me to do?

                         KARL

          anything on the menu.

          Lisa is asleep. The room is dark. She stirs. She realizes
          JOAN is sitting on the edge of her bed, her back to Lisa.

          Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every
          cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount --
          LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is
          dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up.

          She switches on the light --
          BLOOD is streaming out the faucet and filling the basin.

           home. Because I don't care enough, frankly,

          cowboy hat --

                         MARETTI
          Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear

          I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes.
          What.

                         LISA
          If you could just let me...! From my point
          of view, I was out that day trying to buy a
          cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase 
          I was looking for one... and you were kind 
          of waving back...And I know the police 
          already decided it was No Fault, or No
          Criminality or whatever they call it --

                         MARETTI
          No Criminality, that's right.

                         LISA
          -- I guess partly because of what I told
          them. And I know I was distracting you,
          but -- I did see the bus go through the red 
          light. And that's when it hit that woman.

                         MARETTI
          OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over 
          here.

                         LISA
          Only nobody said that to them. And I just
          wanted to like, acknowledge with you that
          that's what happened.

                         MARETTI
          OK. First of all, I don't really know what
          you mean by wavin' at you...What were you,
          tryin' to catch the bus...?

          I'm not trying to get you in trouble.

                         MARETTI
          I know you're not, because you couldn't get
          me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no 
          criminality found...the report is, uh,
          final. And that's it.

                         LISA
          So you're just gonna leave it?

                         MARETTI
          I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that
          it was. If something else would have
          happened, I'd take it to whatever that was.
          It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But
          there's only a certain speed the brakes can
          react. That's a physical limitation of the
          machine. I don't know what else to tell
          you. It was a shock. It's shock. But 
          that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot
          bring her back.

          happened -- it seemed like you were kind of
          looking at me -- like we were saying to
          each other, "Let's not say anything about

                         LISA
          I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to
          do.â¢

                         EMILY
          You didn't know what to do? The woman is
          killed right in front of you and you didn't
          know what to do?

                         LISA
          I know it doesn't sound very impressive.

                         EMILY
          Impressive! (Pause) All right: I know
          you're trying to do the right thing now.
          What does your mother say?

                         LISA
          My mother hasn't really been that helpful.

          What do you mean?

                         LISA
          I mean she's got a lot going on right now
          and she just hasn't been that interested, I
          guess.

                         EMILY
          What could she possibly have going on?

                         LISA
          Her show is opening.

                         EMILY
          What do you mean, her show? What show?

                         LISA
          She's in a play.

                         EMILY
          My friend is dead because some guy was
          looking at your ass and you lied to the
          police about it, and your mother can't be
          bothered because she's in a play?

                         LISA
          Well, it's kind of a big deal for her.
          She has a really big part.

                         EMILY
          I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but,
          that is pretty shocking.

                         LISA
          I guess she's really worried about getting
          a bad review or something.

                         EMILY
          OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a 
          lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin -
          you talked to her -- And you're gonna go
          talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go
          with you?

                         LISA
          No thanks.

                         EMILY
          Do you think maybe you should ask your
          mother to go with you?

                         LISA
          I think I can handle this part myself. 

                         EMILY 
          Oh, I am so angry. I am so angry.

           Fuck him! I'm gonna run over his best 
           friend and then coerce some teenage girl
           into lying to the police about it! He had 
           his chance. Fuck him! Now are you gonna see 
           this through or not?

           I will if you will.

           Just a minute! 

                          JOAN
           Can we just forget it? If they were any 
           good somebody would have called me last 
           night. 

                          LISA 
           No we can't forget it, because I can't take 
           this anymore. What do you care what they 
           say about you anyway?

                          JOAN 
           I don't. It's just a lousy feeling. Can't 
          you understand that? If they wrote mean
          things about you in the newspaper you
          wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree
          with it, or base your self-esteem on it.
          Why can't you understand that?

                         LISA
          I do understand it, because we have this
          conversation every time! You're great in
          the play, you're a great actress, everybody
          thinks you're great, everything about you 
          is great, you're really really pretty -- 

                         JOAN
          Oh shut up. 

                         LISA
          So let me just find the review and then we
          can both kill ourselves, OK?

                         LISA
          No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica
          Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on
          Broadway -- it was in a lot of the
          newspapers...

          OK, yeah, sure OK. Sit down, sit down.

          2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
          You know the case is closed.

                         LISA
          I assume it was. But part of the reason 
          it's closed is because of my statement.
          And the statement I gave --

          2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
          Because of your statement?

          Yes.

          2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE
          What do you mean it was closed because of
          your statement?

          The DA's office closes the case. You don't
          close the case. The DA's office closes the
          case.

                         LISA
          I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean
          I personally closed the case, like,
          legally. I meant that what I said was
          probably instrumental in getting the case
          closed, because I was the --

          This guy been givin' you a hard time?

          No...

          What's this guy been sayin' to you?

                         LISA
          Nothing. I don't know if you remember
          me... I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on 
          Monday?

                          MITCHELL
          Sure I do. What's up?

          120 INT. HIGHWAY ONE POLICE STATION - MITCHELL'S DESK - LATER 120

          Lisa sits across from Mitchell.

                         MITCHELL
          So now you're sayin' he ran the light. 

                         LISA
          Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.
          And I was definitely trying to get his
          attention...

                         MITCHELL
          No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin'
          with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs
          the light, hits the decedent, she dies on
          the scene...the both of youse lie to me on
          both of your statements, and then
          somewheres in there you turn around, decide
          the guy belongs in jail. That right? That
          about right?

                         LISA
          I don't have any control over if he goes to
          jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I
          just want to set the record straight, so
          that if he gets away with this I won't have
          been a part of it.

                         MITCHELL
          And what do you think I should do with you?
          Just gimmeâ¢a clue. 'cause I'm just a little
          bit lost over here...:

                         LISA
          Do whatever you want. I know what I did. 

                         MITCHELL
          OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa,
          anybody will tell you that just because he
          ran a red light is not a criminal offence. 

                         LISA
          Even if he kills someone?

                         MITCHELL

                         (SIMULTANEOUS) 
          Even if you cause an accidental death, 
          that's right. For this to be a criminal
          offense, the law says you need two 
          aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red
          light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red
          light and he was --

                         LISA
          (On 2nd "red")
          So he's not liable to be prosecuted for
          manslaughter? Or second degree murder?

                         MITCHELL
          No. He could be charged with reckless
          driving, and fillip' out a false police
          report. Which, that's no joke --

                         LISA
          That's unbelievable! What does he have to
          do? Kill her on purpose?

                         MITCHELL
          Yes. Because that's the definition of
          murder. Killin' somebody on purpose.
          You're not sayin' he ran her over on
          purpose, are you?
          Pause.

                         LISA
          No.
          Pause.

                         MITCHELL
          All, right, look. Lemme take another
          statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,

          OK?

          No. I'll go over it with my sergeant,
          probably pull this guy in again.
          Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on
          him. See what he says.

          121 EXT. CENTRAL PARK. DAY. 121 

          Lisa and Becky are smoking pot on a rock or bench.

                         LISA
          (holding in smoke)
          .Yeah, because the Central Park
          Conservatory or whatever it's called put up
          about five hundred miles worth of these 
          cheap shitty-looking fences all over the
          park. Which is totally antithetical to
          what the park was originally designed for.
          She exhales and hands Becky the joint.

                         BECKY
          We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my
          God it's John...! It's John!
          They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher,
          who approaches them and stops. Pause.

          up to her and stops.

          situation?

          You know: Not New York.

                         MR AARON
          I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me
          overwhelm you with superfluous details. 

                         LISA
          God, so what are you doing at a New York
          private school teaching geometry to a bunch
          of overprivileged liberal Jews?

                         MR AARON 
          Is that a real question, or a Lisa 
          question?

                         LISA
          What's a Lisa question?

                         MR AARON

          conversation without there being any
          particular interest in the actual
          answer...?

                         LISA

                         LISA
          Before you go, I am actually thinking of
          getting one of these. Can I try it? Just 
          for one second?

          Aaron gets off the bike. She climbs on. The seat is too high
          for her.

          You want me to adjust the seat?

          OK. Off.

          Can I just ask you how is it possible that
          I am totally in love with you and you have
          almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's
          not like I'd ever say anything if you ever
          deigned to like, you know, be with me.

          Lisa...!

          I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a 
          virgin, if that's what you're worried
          about. I'm not even close. 

                         MR AARON
          I can't even be having this conversation
          with you.

                         LISA
          Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice
          you're still standing here.

          Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy
          right now.

                         MR AARON
          I'll see you in class.
          We pull away with him as she watches him go.

          Lisa walks in as Joan is putting on her coat.

                         JOAN
          Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if
          you wanted dinner.

                         LISA
          Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something.

                         JOAN
          Someone named Emily called. And Detective
          Mitchell called from the Accident
          Investigation Squad. Is that the one you
          talked to?

                         LISA
          Yeah, did he say anything?

                         JOAN
          Just to call him back. What's going on? Did 
          you ever go back and see him? 

                         LISA
          I'd rather not talk about it when you have
          one foot out the door. I'll tell you later,
          if that's OK.

                         JOAN
          Of course it is. Who's Emily?

                         LISA
          She's the friend of the woman who died, the
          one who had the funeral...

                         JOAN
          Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the 
          phone.

                         LISA
          OK. How's Ramon?

                         JOAN
          Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like
          him. He's really nice.

          But I'm not sure he actually ever
          understands a word I say.

                         LISA
          Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the
          guy.

                         JOAN
          But don't you know what I mean? I just feel
          kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?

                         LISA
          You feel lonely when you're with him?

                         JOAN
          Yeah. You never felt that way when you were
          with someone?

                         LISA
          I guess so. I feel that way all the time.
          You get used to it.

                         JOAN
          Well ...I don't know how serious I want to
          get with somebody who makes me feel that
          way.

                         LISA
          So don't get serious. That's my advice.
          Pause.

                         JOAN
          All right. I'm gonna go.

          She hits the elevator button. Sees her reflection in the
          little round elevator window. She looks old to herself, and
          haggard. She touches under her chin.

          127 INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT. DAY. 127

          Lisa, Emily and DAVE, a good natured intelligent 35ish
          lawyer, are at a window table.

                         EMILY
          Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends.
          He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't
          know what to do himself he'll certainly
          know someone we can talk to.

                         LISA
          OK, great.

                         EMILY
          So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told
          me, if you don't mind repeating

                         YOURSELF --

                         DAVE
          Not at all. I love to repeat myself.

                         LISA
          Are you guys gonna order something?

          They are drinking coffee. Lisa smokes.

                         DAVE
          When someone is killed it's what you call a
          Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory
          case, which just means there's a statute
          passed by the legislature which gives you
          the right to bring the case.

                         LISA
          As opposed to what?

                         DAVE
          As opposed to common law, which is law made
          by judges. Which is why the damages are
          limited.

                         LISA
          I don't understand.

                         EMILY
          Look, just skip that part. We don't care
          about that.

                         LISA
          I thought we were trying to get the
          police to arrest this guy...!

                         DAVE
          No -- the police are not, uh -- 

                         LISA EMILY 
          Why not? They told me they Dave doesn't think the 
          were gonna look into it police are gonna -- 
          again.

                         DAVE
          I'm just telling you that even if they do,
          there is no way in this world they are
          gonna recommend to the DA that they charge
          this guy. That's why --

                         LISA

                         (ON "THAT'S") 
          So what can we do?

                         DAVE
          Well. I'm --

                         LISA
          Sorry.

                          DAVE EMILY
          That's OK -- That's OK, honey...

                          DAVE
           I'm just getting to that. You can't
           do anything unless you're a relative --

                          EMILY
           She didn't have any relatives, except for 
           those idiots in Arizona --

                          DAVE

                          (ON "EXCEPT")
           -- or -- hang on a minute -- unless you're
           executor of her estate --

                         EMILY
          I am the executor of her estate.

                         DAVE
          -- which is Emily. I know.

                         EMILY
          So good.

                         DAVE
          Yes. This is good. Because the executor of
          the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit,
          but the beneficiary has to be a relative.
          So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful
          Death suit you can sue for Pain and
          Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of
          Support or Services.. .And also what's
          called Care, Comfort and Society: --like
          advice, counseling of the parent that the
          kids aren't gonna get anymore...

                         LISA
          You can really sue for that?

                         DAVE
          Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,

                         LISA
          So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing?
          The bus driver?

                         DAVE
          Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't
          have any money. You basically sue everybody
          and hope something sticks. The person who
          pays will be the MTA's insurance company.

                         LISA
          But do you think the driver would get
          fired?

          Even if all the facts came out at the

                         DAVE
          Maybe. I don't know.

                         EMILY
          But how much could they be liable for?

                         DAVE EMILY
          It depends: How badly do you think we
          could ever hurt them?

                         DAVE
          -- if she was alive, in great pain for an 
          extended period of time, they give more
          money for that.

                         LISA
          I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.

                         DAVE
          And I gather in a lot .of pain?

                         LISA
          Her leg was cut off.

                         DAVE
          Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she
          conscious? Awake, the whole time?

                         LISA
          I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake.

                         EMILY
          That's OK.

                         DAVE 
          Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that
          long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a
          half a million dollars to get a sustainable
          verdict? A brain damaged baby would beâ¢ 
          three million. But the truth is, Lisa, 
          after all's said and done, it's not a very
          good case.

                         LISA
          Why not?

                         DAVE
          Because it's your word against his, and
          because you already lied on your first
          deposition. A red light case is a fifty-
          fifty proposition already. And with only
          one eyewitness, with two conflicting
          statements? I wouldn't take-that case.

          Nobody really cares about getting a lot of
          money here.

                         DAVE
          I understand that --

                         EMILY
          We just want this prick to Buffer. and we
          want the bus company to take resonsibility
          for hiring this guy.

                         DAVE
          I understand. But no matter how you slice
          it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first
          statement is a disaster for your lawyer.

                         LISA
          Can't I explain why I lied the first time?
          It's not like I'm trying to get any money
          for myself.

                         DAVE
          That's true-Since she have no financial
          interest she can't be impeached for bias.

                         EMILY
          Impeached for what?

                         DAVE
          She can't have her credibility attacked on
          financial grounds because the jury knows
          you're not getting any money if you win.

                         LISA
          So that's'something, isn't it?

                         EMILY

          means?

          I'm sorry. That's what its called.

                         EMILY
          But who are you talking to? You know we
          don't know what that means. It's like
          you're not really concentrating.

                         DAVE
          I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm
          just thinking out loud.

          Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is
          it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a
          lot of publicity.

                         LISA
          Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy --

          Is to fucking get this guyl

                         LISA
          No, its to get him out from behind the
          wheel of a bus!

                         DAVE
          Did she know she was dying? I only ask
          because the terror of knowing you're dying
          raises the damages.

                         LISA
          I think she had a pretty good idea.

                         DAVE
          If she had lived for a couple of days it
          would make the case better...I know this
          sounds horrible, but this is what it comes
          down to...

          I know. We know, Dave. That's OK.
          Silence. Emily starts to speak:

          I actually did have one more thought...I do
          know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo
          know what I want to do7 I want to make a
          few phone calls, and then, just let me get
          back to you.

                         EMILY
          I would just like somebody to take
          responsibility for what happened.

          Detective Mitchell.

                         LISA
          Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.

                         MITCHELL
          Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?

                         LISA
          Well, I was just wondering what ever
          happened, if anything, with the case.
          You said you might re-interview the bus
          driver...

                         MITCHELL

                          
          Yes, we did:.We brought him back in --

                         LISA
          You did? What happened?

                         MITCHELL
          Well, he basically stuck to his original
          representation, and that was pretty much
          it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but
          he agrees with me we still don't have
          enough to charge this guy, so there's
          really not a lot more we can do at this
          point.

                         LISA
          But how did you ask the questions?

                         MITCHELL
          Excuse me? 

                         LISA
          He's obviously not gonna change his 

                          
          statement if you just ask him like really
          politely: Why would he? We already know
          he's a liar.

                         MITCHELL 
          Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd
          just throw him in the back with a rubber
          hose and we'd get whatever answer we want
          out of him. But fortunately we don't do 
          that kind of thing anymore --

                         LISA
          Yeah, not to white people.

                         MITCHELL
          Excuse me?

          You don't do it to white people. Anyway, 
          I'm not saying you -- 

                         MITCHELL 
          We don't do it to who?

                         LISA
          Oh my God...

                         MITCHELL
          First of all, I don't know why you're
          bringin' the guy's race into it. There's
          forty thousand cops in this city --

                         LISA
          Yes, thank you, yes.

                         MITCHELL
          -- and I hate to disillusion you, but most
          of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to
          do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not
          gonna take this case. (Pause) Now you could
          talk to my sergeant if you want to, but --

                         LISA
          Yes, I would.

          131 INT. COHEN HALLWAY/KITCHEN. DUSK. 131

          Joan, dressed to go to work, drops her keys in her purse as
          she comes down the hall and lingers in the kitchen doorway to
          find LISA on the phone, listening, then:

                         LISA
          So there's no way to appeal --

          SERGEANT V.O. 
          (over the phone, flat)
          There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case.

                         LISA
          But how do you know Detective Mitchell
          interrogated him aggressively enough if you
          weren't there?

                         JOAN
          What's going on?
          LISA waves her away.

          Joan and Ramon are having drinks and looking at his great
          view of the Upper West Side. Joan is smoking.

                         JOAN
          -- so funny: it's the same show, but now
          they all read how great it is, we get these
          big standing ovations every night, and it's
          the exact same show as before.

                         RAMON
          But why do you put yourself down? It's a
          wonderful show and a wonderful performance.

                         JOAN
          No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself
          down. It's just that the audience always
          reacts differently if they've been told
          it's good. A lot of actors have that
          experience.

                         RAMON
          Mm hm?
          She takes a few steps away.

                         JOAN
          I love this view...(Pause) You know,
          Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you,
          but do you ever worry that we don't have
          very much in common?

                         RAMON
          What do you mean?

                         JOAN
          Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied,
          or disgruntled. But I feel like we're 
          always misunderstanding each other. Do you
          feel that way at all? Or am I just
          completely off the beam?

                         RAMON
          I don't think we should talk about that,
          Joan.

                         JOAN
          You don't? Well...I think it's kind of 
          important or I wouldn't have brought it up. 

                         RAMON
          Joan... I like you very much. But let's not
          talk about what you are like, and what I am
          like. That never makes a good result. Talk 
          about it with your friends.

          May I show you some pictures of my boys?

                         JOAN
          Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like.

          132A INT. RAMON'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 132A

          Ramon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean
          carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures.

                         RAMON
          That's a little place we used to go on
          holiday, two hours outside of
          Cartagena...My family is all there still,
          but Rodrigo is studying in London, and
          Hector is in Geneva.

                         JOAN 
          Uh huh... 

                         RAMON 
          I'm sure they will go back eventually,
          because they like to do something for their 
          country. But it's a worry, because it's 
          very bad there now.

                         JOAN 
          Yeah...I haven't really been following it.

                         RAMON
          It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to
          found an organization to work with children
          whose families have been killed, or the
          parents have been kidnapped, so they don't
          know if they are alive or dead. We try to
          find homes for them, preferably in
          Colombia, because if we lose our young
          people, that's it: That's the future. We
          have raised a lot of money, but there's
          only so much we can do. You don't like to
          say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the
          solution.

                         JOAN
          Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about
          it...Do you mind if I ask you something?

                         RAMON
          Of course not.

                         JOAN
          Why are you interested in me?

          Not for me.

                         JOAN
          I guess you travel a lot. I've only been
          out of the country a few times in my whole
          life.

                         RAMON
          You should travel more.

                         JOAN
          I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard
          when you're in the theater...

                         RAMON
          Still, you should try. It's a big world.
          You're an artist. You should see more of
          it.

                         JOAN
          I know. You don't have to keep saying that.
          I've always wanted to travel. It's just a
          little difficult with two kids and no
          husband, but it's hard to make a lot of
          money in the theater. I was on a TV show a
          few years back and I socked away some money
          because of that, but my ex-husband --

                         RAMON 
          Karl.

                         JOAN
          Karl, yes, you remembered, very good.
          Karl's very generous with the kids when he
          can be, but he's struggling too: He's a
          director: he directs commercials, and now
          he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm
          not ignorant because I enjoy it.

                         RAMON
          I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think
          Lisa will be interested in acting? 

                         JOAN
          I don't think so. I think's she's got a
          lot of contempt for it. Of course that may
          be the age.

                         RAMON 
          She would prefer the world with no plays? 
          No films?

                         DAVE
          Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he
          called this guy he knows who used to be a
          cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have
          their own police? The MTA police? They have
          their own uniforms...

                         EMILY
          Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

                         DAVE EMILY
          And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we
           give a fuck about the MTA 
          police and their uniforms?! 

                         DAVE
          -- so this guy got someone to let him
          sneak a look at your guy's file. And it
          turns out he's had two previous accidents --
          less than two years apart -- one of them on
          the job, one in his own car --

                         EMILY
          What?

                         DAVE
          -- where there was some allegation that he
          was drinking, which was dropped, but, that 
          he's never been cited or disciplined, just
          moved around to different shifts --

                         EMILY
          Are you fucking kidding me?

                         LISA

                         DAVE
          And if you read the paper, you'll know
          they're going through a protracted labor
          dispute at the MTA right now, and according
          to my PI, the management doesn't want to
          aggravate the situation by firing this guy.
          Especially since the police have concluded
          he was not at fault.

                         LISA
          This is making me sick.

                         DAVE
          I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we
          have a case.

                         LISA
          We do?

                         DAVE
          What it means, in fact, is that we have a
          very good case, because we can sue for
          what's called "Negligent Retention." Which
          means they should have known the guy was a
          bad risk and was irresponsible and they
          negligently retained him until he finally
          killed somebody.

                         EMILY
          And you can prove that?

                         DAVE
          Sure, because we can subpoena their
          Personnel records, which we already know
          contain damaging information, because my
          investigator got a look at them beforehand.
          Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did
          it anyway.

                         LISA

          And that means...

                         DAVE
          That means we're in great shape and I think
          we should go in there and sue their fuckin'
          asses off.

          Oh, Monica's father left some money to
          Abigail's kids and he made Monica the
          executor of the estate, because he didn't

          their hands on the money before the kids
          were grown up.

          For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering
          her about it on the phone for fifteen
          years: Always trying to borrow money
          against the estate, accusing her of making
          lousy investments with it, nasty phone
          calls, nasty letters, every month for
          fifteen years until Abigail's daughter
          turned twenty-one and got married. Then
          Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking
          Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak
          to her. She's a dream.

                         LISA
          So that's who we're getting the money for?

                         EMILY
          It's not who we're getting it for, it's who
          we're getting it from.

          136 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 136

           Emily and Lisa sit with RUSSEL DEUTSCH, 50s. His law office
          is slightly smaller and less nice than Dave's.

                         DEUTSCH
          First thing we do is we file a summons and
          a complaint against the MTA. They get
          .twenty days to respond, and when they do we
          can make our Discovery requests: Accident
          reports, personnel records, et cetera. But
          you gotta realize it's gonna take some
          time. The law says you have to get a court
          date within a year. Usually it takes about
          six. Depending.

                         LISA
          Six years!

                         DEUTSCH
          Depending, yes.

                         EMILY
          Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend
          who writes for the Metro section of the
          Times...

                         DEUTSCH
          Yes: Now this, if it could really happen,
          this changes everything in our favor. If
          they think there's gonna be adverse
          publicity, especially in The New York
          Times, they're gonna want to settle right
          away, soon as possible, and as quietly as

                         POSSIBLE --

                         EMILY

          It's usually done, you get the money but
          you can't talk about it. Nobody knows the
          terms.

                         LISA

          You get the money. (Pause) is that bad?
          (Pause) I thought that's what we're all 
          here for. (Pause) This is how our society 
          punishes people for doing bad things.

          Yes. It's called Punitive Damages.
          Pause.

                         LISA
          Could we insist they fire the driver? As
          part of the settlement?

                         DEUTSCH 
          Yes, sure, why not? 

                         LISA
          But is that something people do?

                         DEUTSCH 
          Sure. It's one of your conditions.

                         EMILY
          Great.

                         LISA

                         EMILY
          I don't go to the theater very much.

                         JOAN 
          Well, it's just nice, because you can work
          a long time in the theater and play really
          good parts without getting a lot of
          recognition. And even though you don't 
          necessarily do it for that as your primary
          motive, it is very nice when people do
          notice something you've done.

                         EMILY 
          Uh huh...

                         JOAN
          I was on a television show a few years ago,
          and I had been doing theater all my life,
          and suddenly all my relatives started
          calling me up to congratulate me because
          they thought I finally Made It. And it was
          really just this dumb show that paid the
          bills for a while...

                         LISA
          That show was so stupid.

                         JOAN
          It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize
          this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but
          I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because
          you've frankly become such a big part of
          Lisa's life, and I don't want to be
          intrusive, but this whole court case seems
          to be suddenly dominating everything and I
          can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it

                         LISA
          That's not true...!

                         JOAN
          Well, I can't...! And I want you to know,
          Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for
          pursuing this the way you have.

          But I can't let you pursue it to the point
          where it's taking over your life or
          interfering with your school work. (To
          EMILY) It's really come down to a question
          of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship
          at her school. And I know she feels a real 
          sense of responsibility about what happened

                         LISA
          Yeah, I do.

                         JOAN
          I know you do. I know you do. But you can't
          not do your homework, and you can't throw
          away your scholarship because of it.

                         LISA
          I'm not. My grades slipped a little.
          They'll get better. Anyone can do their

          I've been distracted. I'll stop.

                         LISA
          We didn't need to have a big conference
          about it.

                         JOAN

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          It's not a big conference, I just want to
          know what's going on. And I wanted to meet
          Emily... (to EMILY) I know it's a little
          awkward!

                         EMILY
          Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been
          keeping you apprised of what's been going
          on, I think she should. You should.

                         LISA
          There's nothing to keep her apprised of.,
          We're just waiting for them to schedule the
          Discovery conference.

                         JOAN
          Now what is that?

                         LISA
          Mom? It really doesn't matter.

          A Discovery conference is a meeting with
          the court where they sign an order.
          authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the
          personnel records, interviewing witnesses,
          talking to Monica's cousin...

                         JOAN
          OK, now where does she fit in?

                         EMILY
          She gets the money.

          140 EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL. DAY. 140

          ABIGAIL BERWITZ, 40s, gets out the taxi as the driver comes
          around with her matching luggage.

          141 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 141


                          
          Abigail sits with Deutsch.

                         DEUTSCH 
          How would you describe the relationship
          overall? Did you talk on the phone a
          lot? Were there a lot of visits --

                         ABIGAIL
          I would say we talked on the phone a couple
          of times a month at least. Sometimes more
          than that...I would call her, she would
          call me...

                         DEUTSCH 
          And what were the nature of these
          conversations?

          ABIGAIL.
          Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my
          kids...

                         DEUTSCH
          And she would advise you about your family?
          That kind of thing?

                         ABIGAIL
          Oh, I would say so, yes.

                         DEUTSCH 
          Would you have any phone records? Or --

                         ABIGAIL
          I have all my phone bills, if that's what
          you mean. I didn't record the actual
          conversations...

                         (PRODUCES BILLS)
          You'll see we talked on the phone quite
          frequently.

                         DEUTSCH
          OK, that's terrific. I see you came
          prepared...1

                         ABIGAIL
          Well, I wanted to bring everything.

                         DEUTSCH 
          Now when they take your deposition you're
          gonna say the same thing you just told me.
          Talk about the relationship...

                         ABIGAIL
          Uh huh?

                         DEUTSCH 
          Kind of advice she used to give you...

                         ABIGAIL

          OK...?

          142 INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY. 142

          Emily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is
          drinking a white wine. 

                         ABIGAIL
          Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?

                         EMILY
          He was recommended by a friend.

                         ABIGAIL
          I'm asking because my husband knows a real
          good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely
          comfortable with someone that no one has
          ever heard of --

                         EMILY
          My friend's heard of him. He says he's very
          good..

                         ABIGAIL
          I'm sure he does. But I have a 
          responsibility in this situation, and I
          would feel a whole lot more comfortable
          with somebody who didn't just drop in out
          of the clear blue sky...

                         EMILY
          He didn't drop in out of the clear blue
          sky. He was recommended by my friend.
          But even if we switched lawyers we'd still
          have to pay him. But it all comes out of
          the settlement, so it's really up to you.

                         ABIGAIL
          No, if you all think he's good...

                         EMILY
          I don't know whether he is or not. My
          friend thinks he is.

                         ABIGAIL
          All right. Now Lisa, what is your
          involvement in all this? What's your angle?

                         LISA
          I just wanted to...I was just there.

          143 INT. EMILY'S DINING ROOM. DAY. 143

          Emily comes into the dining room with a cup of coffee. Lisa
          is standing over the table looking at some of Monica's photos
          and belongings which are spread out all over the table. Emily
          starts putting the pictures away in their envelopes.

                         LISA
          Oh my God, is that you?

                         EMILY

                          
          That's me.

                         LISA

                          
          And that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my

                          
          God. Is that her daughter?

                         EMILY

                          
          Uh huh.

                         LISA
          God... So how old was she when she died? 

                         EMILY

                          
          Twelve.

                         LISA
          God. I can't even imagine. 

                         EMILY
          Neither could we. 

                          
          Emily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put

                          
          them in the box. Lisa sits down too.

          Emily looks up.

                         EMILY
          No. I didn't.

                         LISA

                          
          Yeah. I think she was confused... like, I

                          
          think she thought I was her daughter for a
          minute. And then she was asking me to call
          her, like to tell her what happened: You
          know, like she didn't remember she was
          dead.

                         EMILY
          What do you mean? What did she say?

                         LISA
          She just asked if somebody could call her
          daughter. But then it got confusing because
          I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she
          said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No,
          that's my name." Because it took me a
          minute -- I didn't realize we had the same
          name...
          Emily does not respond.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
           But I couldn't tell if what I was saying

                          
          was registering with her.
          Emily does not respond.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          But then when I found out her daughter was
          dead, ever since then I keep having this
          really strong feeling that some way, for
          those last five minutes I kind of was her
          daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the
          reason I was there: Like in some weird way,
          this obviously amazing woman got to see her
          daughter again for a few minutes, right
          before she died.

                         EMILY

                         (VERY DRY)
          I see. And is she still inhabiting your
          body? Or did she go right back to the
          spirit world after it was over?

                         LISA
          I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting
          my body. I don't believe in all that stuff
          at all.

          I don't give a fuck what you believe in.

          What does that have to do with anything?

          Do you understand? It's not worth anything,
          because it'll be troweled over in a month
          or two. And then when you get older, and
          you don't have a big reaction every time a
          d gets run over, then, then we'll find
          out what kind of a person you are! But this

          OK. Um, you should leave.

                         LISA
          Why? Because I called you strident?

          Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks.
          I don't wanna be called strident and you're
          deliberately misunderstanding me!

                         LISA
          No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as
          it is: You don't have to call me stupid
          too!

                         EMILY
          Well I can't stop you doing this so I think
          you had better go.

                         LISA
          OK! I will.

                         EMILY

          OK! Let me get my purse!
          Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives
          her toward the door.

          Does this mean we're dropping the whole
          inquiry?

                         EMILY
          It means you're leaving. I don't know what
          else it means.

                         LISA
          All I meant by saying you were strident was
          that you were being emphatic! I obviously
          misused the word!

                         EMILY
          Look it up when you get home.

                         LISA
          Jesus Christ. You're amazing.

                         EMILY
          Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.

          Why are you doing this... .!

          Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human

          fascinating story of your life!

                         LISA
          I never said or thought you were...! And I
          really didn't mean to call you strident! I

                          
          totally misused the word! I wasn't trying
          to insult you, Emily, I really wasn't! I
          feel so bad about what happened and I'm
          trying so hard to do something about it!
          And I don't understand why if I say
          something wrong you can't just give me a
          break! I didn't mean I thought her daughter
          took over my body. I'm not an idiot. It was
          just this feeling I had because she was
          holding onto my hand so hard before she
          died, and because we had the same first
          name!

          But I'm not trying to dramatize anything,

          nothing like this has ever happened to

          INTERVIEWER ON TV(O.C.)
          Now, any talk of the play becoming a film?

          JOAN ON TV (O.C.)
          Oh, I'm sure. But I would never get cast in
          that. I'm not a movie star.

          Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to
          come see the play? I thought you could
          both come and them maybe we could go out
          afterwards.

                         LISA
          All right. Let me ask her.

          Yeah. You're all worried about my grades.
          They have really good public schools in
          Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived

                         JOAN

          145 INT. HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 145

          On the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS

          RULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO?

                         KLEIN
          OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your
          drum away.
          Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.

                         KIRSTEN
          I think that teenagers should definitely
          rule the world, because teenagers aren't
          corrupted by adult life yet, and they're
          idealists and they care. And I know a lot
          of people feel that teenagers are really
          naive, which they are, many of them. But
          they still haven't had a chance to get
          burned out by the disappointments and the
          harsh realities of learning how to play the
          game. So yes, I would vote yes.

                         KLEIN
          All right: Lisa?

                         LISA
          I would tend to agree with all of that,
          except I do think that teenagers don't
          always necessarily think things through
          very carefully, and they don't have enough
          experience to know what the right thing to
          do is all the time. I also think they tend
          to adhere to ideologies really easily
          without having actually bothered to think
          them through for themselves.--

                         LEWIS
          Such as what?

          the Hitler Youth?

          OK... Hitler Youth.

                         LISA
          Or what about all these teenage suicide
          bombers? Not that I want to get into the
          whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming
          you don't think suicide bombing is a good
          thing, wouldn't you say that's an example
          of being idealistic without using your
          critical faculties?

                         MONICA
          Well, I don't know if this is good or bad,
          but speaking of ideology, it's interesting
          that the suicide bombers -- just for
          example -- care enough about what they
          believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.

          I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice

          without yelling or interrupting each other
          or raising your hands, I'd say it was a
          pretty good argument for "No."

                         LISA
          Why, adults don't yell and interrupt each
          other?

          Lisa! 

                         LISA
          Sorry.

                         LEWIS 
          Let's try to put this in a broader
          perspective. The question was not actually
          who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict

                         ANGIE
          The Israelis.

          Lisa!

          You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who
           opens their mouth without
          LISA raising their hand is.
          I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class!
          who cares what I am? I'm anti- 
          murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS
           Lisa? Lisa? You can leave!

                         LISA
          Fine. Thank you.
          Lisa passes the blackboard, grabs some chalk and checks "NO. "

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          By the way, she just proved my point.

                         ANGIE LEWIS
          No I didn't. Lisa, GO!
          Lisa leaves. Lewis turns to the class.

          Ramon CLAPS as Joan comes out to greet him, Lisa and Emily.

                         RAMON
          That's the best show yet! Every time it's
          a better performance.

                         JOAN
          God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much
          for coming...

                         EMILY
          Oh, thank you for the tickets.
          Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.

                         JOAN
          Shall we go?

          147 INT. RESTAURANT/BAR. NIGHT. 147

          Joan, Lisa, Emily and Ramon are having drinks.

          comparing the Israelis to Nazis...

          But who is running these discussions...?

                         RAMON
          Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's
          always easy for the dominant side to be
          content with the status quo.

                         JOAN
          Mmm.

                         - EMILY
          How do you mean, Ramon?

                         RAMON
          I mean the oppressor is always in favor of
          law and order because it's his law and his
          order. He uses violence to maintain his 
          position and calls it the rule of law. But 
          when the person underfoot uses violence to
          change his status he's called a criminal
          and a terrorist, and the violence of the
          State is called upon to put him down, and 
          once again it's called the rule of law. In

                         EMILY

          "They" meaning --

                         EMILY
          The Jew oppressors. What would you like
          them to do?
          Pause.

                         RAMON
          I didn't use that expression. EMILY
          But since you ask - No, you didn't. (i.e.
          "You didn't have to.")

                         LISA
          Um, I just spent the whole day arguing
          about this: I didn't really mean to bring
          it up again.

                         RAMON LISA
          And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom.

          That's what I think!
          Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.

          That seems excessive, Emily, come on --

                         RAMON
          That's the response. That's the Jewish
          response.

          It's the what?

                         RAMON

          Sorry about all that tonight.

                         JOAN
          Yeah. Your friend is a delight.

                         LISA
          She's a really passionate person. She
          really cares about things.

                         JOAN
          She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not
          hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --

                         LISA
          So what? Why is it so JOAN
          important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm
          polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with
          is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in
          an exchange of ideas. As it
          happens Ramon said a few
          things I wasn't too crazy
          about either, so I guess
          that's the end of that...

           Joan, I won't defend myself. All what I 

                          
           meant was, that was the typical response
           you will get from someone who will take
           that position that that woman was taking. 
           But if you like to break up with me because

           WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

                          LISA
          Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking
          forward to our horseback riding trip...

                         KARL
          Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think
          it's going to happen.

                         LISA
          Really? What's the matter?

                         KARL
          Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to
          really want to go, and I don't really feel
          like spending three thousand bucks on
          something nobody has the slightest interest
          in. So I think it's obviously better for
          everyone if we just cancel.

                         LISA
          I never said I didn't want to go.

                         KARL
          Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer
          about what anybody wants to eat, um,
          Annette is giving me a hard time about her
          schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get
          are monosyllables, so --

                         LISA
          I think-he's really looking forward to it --

                         KARL
          Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really 
          been my impression. So, uh...I also think 
          it would be good to shelve the idea of your
          coming out here next year.

          It looks like things are gonna start
          picking up for me in the Fall, which means
          I'm probably not gonna be around the house
          all that much, and since you and Annette
          detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't
          think that's what I want to come home to
          after a fourteen hour day.

          something you're that serious about anyway,
          so what do you say we just table it for the
          time being?

          want to spend the money.

          No, I know there was some problem with
          Annette about arranging for food because I
          don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think
          it was.going to wreck the whole trip.

          Lisa sits on a sofa. She takes a sip of coffee.

                         LISA
          Thank you for letting me come up. I don't
          know who else to talk to.
          She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.

                         MR AARON
          That's all right...

                         LISA
          You've always been very sympathetic to my
          craziness, and I may not show it all the
          time, but I actually really appreciate it.

                         MR AARON
          It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going
          on?

                         LISA
          I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't
          completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not
          even who I am, but what's going on inside
          me, or all around me. Sound confused
          enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I
          always felt like we understood each other
          on some level, even though I'm like a mass
          of conflicting impulses and you're
          basically the most grown-up, rational man I
          know.

                         MR AARON
          Well...I doubt that's actually true
          but thank you...

          You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me.
          Like that seems to be your leading feature.
          I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty
          deep feelings...So when you're rational -
          just to finish my thought -- it's like this
          really interesting way of governing
          yourself.

          And you don't have to get all uncomfortable
          again: I'm not talking about what you think
          I'm talking about, because I know that
          subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about
          your soul, I guess, and how you feel you
          have to keep it in check all the time by
          being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying
          at all?

                         MR AARON
          Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen
          to believe that who you are comes out of
          how you deal with those feelings. Somebody
          makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun
          and shoot them...Or if you do, that says
          something about who you are, and how you've
          been raised...

                         LISA
          Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but
          we happen to be living in a world where
          that is what people do. More often than
          not.

                         MR AARON
          That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very
          sad that you see it that way. There's
          eight billion people alive in the world and
          you think they don't all want to kill
          someone once in a while? But they don't.
          Most of them. Or they see some person they
          -- (Pause) I think most people do try to be 
          civilized by some standard. Even if it's a
          standard you and I might not agree with...

                         LISA
          No, I get it. That's actually the most
          hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a
          long time. I don't know why I take such a
          dire view of things, I really don't.

          this all right?

          Sure.

           She lifts her head up and they kiss for real. After a moment

                         EMILY
          Yes, we're getting that, Rob.

                         ROB
          But you see what I mean?

                         DEUTSCH
          Yes -- Rob? Yes I do.

                         ROB
          I just want to go on record as saying I
          think this whole meeting is premature.

                         ABIGAIL
          Absolutely. We're not lawyers --

                         DEUTSCH
          Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something
          clear. One conversation does not commit you
          to anything.

           So if you're telling me not to take the
           meeting I'm not gonna take the meeting.

           ABIGAIL - ROB
           No. We're not saying that. No no no -- Go for it.

          158 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 158

          Lisa has just told Joan the news. Joan is on the sofa.

                         JOAN
          Lisa, I'm really proud of you!

                         LISA
          Thank you.

                         JOAN
          Really, really proud...!

                         LISA
          Thank you.
          Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up.

                         LISA (CONT'D)
          Are you upset about something...?

                         JOAN
          No. This house is really beginning to get
          to me. And I'm a little confused what to do
          about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What
          do you think?

                         LISA
          Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think
          about it some more. Because it would
          probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke
          up with him and I think you better think
          about it before you do something like that
          to him.

                         JOAN
          I know I'm supposed to understand what
          you're doing right now, but if there's some
          kind of hidden message here I'm not getting
          it.

                         LISA
          No shit. You're on your own, Mom.

                         JOAN
          Thanks a lot.

                         LISA
          You're welcome.
          The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up.

          Hello? -Yes . WHAT DO YOU MEAN??

                          LISA
           What's the matter?

                          JOAN

                          (LISTENING) 
          Yes? . Yes? (To LISA) Ramon had a heart
          attack.

                          LISA
           What? Is he gonna be -- 

                          JOAN 
          uiet! 
          CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead
          of dissolving, Joan listens, straightens up and calms down as
          the person on the phone talks.

          159 EXT. RIVERSIDE CHAPEL. DAY. 159

          Mourners are going inside the funeral parlor.

          160 INT. FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY. 160

          Joan and Lisa look around the room.

                         LISA
          OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but
          isn't this a Jewish funeral home?

                         JOAN
          I guess they do both. 
          They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little 
          too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. 
          RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His
          accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.

                         RODRIGO
          Excuse me. Joan?

                         JOAN
          Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm
          so sorry.
          She impulsively embraces him.

                         JOAN (CONT'D)
          Rodrigo, this is my --

                         RODRIGO
          I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked
          about you all the time.

                         JOAN
          He did?

                         RODRIGO
          Yes. The night he met you, he called me in
          England and woke me to tell me about it, he
          was so excited. I never heard him talk
          about anyone like that since my mother
          died.

                         JOAN 
          Really? 

                         RODRIGO 
          I don't know if this is appropriate... 

                         JOAN
          No it's OK...!

                         RODRIGO
          .but he went out a lot. Do you know the 
          last time I spoke to him he told me from 
          the moment he met you he knew he wanted to
          marry you, because for the first time since 
          he lost my mother, he finally met a woman
          he could really connect with.

                         JOAN
          (at a total loss)
          Well -- he was a very sweet man. And I know
          he loved you and your brother very much.

                         RODRIGO

                         (GETTING TEARFUL)
          Yeah, I know he did. Thank you.

          161 INT. LISA'S ROOM. DAY. 161

          Lisa is at her computer. Joan is by the doorway.

                         JOAN
          Thanks for coming with me today. I really
          appreciate it.

                         LISA
          Oh, you're welcome.

                         JOAN
          I don't want to be macabre, but Ramon and I
          were supposed to go to hear The Tales of
          Hoffman the week after next and I still
          have the tickets. Would you be interested
          in going? Or should I give them away?

          Um, I'll go.

                         JOAN
          OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.

                         LISA

          OK.

                         JOAN
          What did you make of that?

                         LISA

                         (STILL TYPING)
          People don't relate to each other, Mom.
          They're totally disconnected. And if they
          have any time for each other at all, it's
          either like a biological imperative or like
          some weird cultural anomaly. That's what I
          make of it.

                         JOAN
          Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that
          you think that. Because I feel like you and
          I used to relate to each other really well.

                         LISA
          I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.
          It's just a general observation.

                         JOAN
          OK...Hey, could I get a hug?

                         LISA
          Sure.
          Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.

                         JOAN
          I just feel totally at sea. 
          They break apart.

          162 INT. DINER. DAY. 162

          Mr Aaron and Lisa sit in a booth. Mr Aaron looks grim.

          I've thought about this a great deal, and
          I'm going to come forward.

          Well, that's what I'm comfortable doing.

                         LISA
          Suit yourself. I'll deny everything and
          you're gonna look like a total psycho.

                          
          And then my Mom'11 have you arrested, and
          then spend the rest of her life feeling bad
          about it. So why don't we just skip the
          whole thing and forget about it?

                         MR AARON
          I'm not sure I know how to do that.

          Joan and Lisa are looking at the little stick.

          laughing) Baby... .?

          Yes! Now who is the father?

                         LISA
          It could be a lot of people.
          Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan
          takes a sympathetic step toward her. Lisa shrinks back. Joan
          stops. Her expression hardens.

                         JOAN

                         (ON "SUCH")
          No, but you want to send that bus driver to
          jail for running a red light! And you won't
          tell me about these boys?

          166 INT. GYNECOLOGIST WAITING ROOM/HALL/RECOVERY ROOM. 166

          Joan waits. She looks around the small room. There are two
          couples and two lone women. A NURSE appears.

          Joan goes into the recovery room. Lisa is on the table in a
          crumpled paper robe, looking like a small crumpled piece of
          paper herself. Joan sits down.

          I think they're very anxious to settle, but
          I also do think that at this moment they're
          under the maximum amount of pressure we can
          really bring to bear, and I don't believe
          they're gonna come up any higher --

          stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and
          Lisa to be here is because I know this may
          be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that

                          
          the bus company will absolutely not discuss
          the removal of the driver.

          Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa,
          I pressed them very very hard on this, but
          they will not discuss disciplining of a
          company employee as part of the settlement
          because it could be seen as an admission of
          guilt on the part of the MTA --

                         LISA
          What does giving us three hundred thousand
          dollars mean?

                          

                         DEUTSCH
          Settling out of court does not imply an
          admission of guilt. It simply does not
          carry the same stigma. On top of that you
          may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a
          very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right

                         NOW:

          Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're
          thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we
          should take Russel's recommendation while
          we can. Because if they won't fire the
          guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six
          months or a year from now we're gonna --

                         ROB
          Exactly.

                         ABIGAIL
          we're gonna be in a situation where
          we're beggin' them for half this much,
          which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as
          now, and they're still not gonna fire this
          guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and
          the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do
          you see what I mean?

                         LISA
          The entire point of the lawsuit was to get
          the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody
          else -- !

                          DEUTSCH 
          Lemme just clarify --

                         LISA
          -- it was not to get you three hundred and
          fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you
          were entitled to, for somebody you didn't
          even like... !

                         ABIGAIL
          This is a distortion --

                         LISA
          And the only reason you're getting the
          money at all is because I started this
          whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry
          for swearing, but you should be willing to
          trade in all the money for getting this guy
          off the street --

                         EMILY
          For getting him, Abigail!

                         ABIGAIL
          Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility
          to Monica and I take that responsibility
          very seriously. You are talking about an
          offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we
          don't do something about it right now.

          telephone and cursed at for having the
          courtesy to involve you in these
          discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would
          be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm
          wrong about that.

          the one who killed her! But at least I
          know I did it, and that guy has no idea!
          And he's wandering around blaming everybody
          else and all I want is for somebody to let
          him know that what he did was wrong! And
          if they don't fire him and all you want is
          the money and the police won't do anything,
          how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't
          take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you
          could get any money, it was because we
          wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter
          about the money! You wouldn't have gotten
          it before!

          Well it may not matter to you, but where I
          come from three hundred and fifty thousand
          dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my
          mind is a positive result of all this
          tragedy and not just negative. Not just
          getting someone fired for one mistake, no
          matter how bad it was --

          No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry
          anyway, whichever one he is.

          I don't see what difference that makes, if
          he's sorry. And I think whoever it is
          should know about this.

          She shakes her head and runs away.

                         BONNIE
          What was that...?

          170 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 170

          Lisa comes in. Curtis is doing his homework at the table.

                         CURTIS
          Mom's looking for you.

                         LISA
          What for?

                         CURTIS
          She thinks you're going out with her
          tonight.

                         LISA
          Where are we going?

                         CURTIS
          I don't know.
          Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.

                         JOAN
          Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to
          the opera?

                         LISA
          Yes.

                         JOAN
          I didn't-remind you because I didn't want
          to nag you.

                         LISA
          It's OK.

          171 EXT. BROADWAY -- NEAR LINCOLN CENTER. DUSK. 171

           Lisa starts to cross the street against the light. Joan takes
          her arm.

                         JOAN
          Don't get run over.
          A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is
          approaching.

                         LISA
          Wait. I want to see if that's him.

                         JOAN
          What.
          They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them
          and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.

                         LISA
          It is him. Mom, that's the one...
          Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as
          people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see
          their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two
          dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at
          them and drives past with a short wave.
          Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.

                         JOAN
          Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.

          172 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT. 172

          Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out
          over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,
          but Lisa won't look at her or interact.

                         JOAN
          Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I
          ever heard.

                         LISA
          What do you mean? It's OK.
          The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in.
          Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.

           172A INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA - GRAND STAIRCASE. NIGHT 172A 

           Lisa comes down the stairs and goes into -- 

          173 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT. 173

           Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The 
           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way 
           past the other patrons in the row, whispering "Excuse me" and
           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. 
           Lisa stares straight ahead. 

           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the 
          barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful.
          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,
          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and
          wipes them away, but they keep coming.
          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.
          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,
          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts
          crying too out of sympathy.

          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa
          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand
          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that
          the spell has been broken.

          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.

                         THE END

    INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY
1                                                                    1

    The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
    screens.

    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
    early twenties.

                        SETH
              Is that them?

                           PETER
              (nods yes)

                        SETH
              Jesus Christ.

    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
    almost every person on the floor watches.

                        SETH (cont'd)
              Are they going to do it right there?

                           PETER
              Yeah.

                           SETH
              Fuck me.

    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.

                        WILL EMERSON
                  (whispered)
              Have you guys ever seen this before?

                           SETH
              No.

                        WILL EMERSON
              Best to just ignore it. Keep your head
              down and get back to work... and don't
              watch.



                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                               2.

    The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
    then stops a bit down from them.

                           HEATHER
                 Timothy Singh?

                              TIMOTHY
                 Yes.

                           HEATHER
                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
    back into the numbers on his computer screen.

    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

                              HEATHER (cont'd)
                 Eric Dale?

                              PETER
                 Excuse me?

                              HEATHER
                 Eric Dale?

                              PETER
                 No.

                              HEATHER
                 Sorry?

                           PETER
                 I'm not Eric Dale.

                           HEATHER
                 Oh. I'm so sorry.

                           PETER
                 He's my boss, he's down that hall.
                                                                  3.

     ERIC DALE is sitting at his desk, he is 52 years old and
     looks exhausted. He looks out through the glass of his office
     as she walks over to the door.

                           HEATHER
               Mr. Dale?

                           ERIC
               Yes.

                           HEATHER

     ERIC walks out the door first.

     They walk along the full length of the trading floor to reach
     one of the conference rooms. Everyone left on the floor is
     watching.

     There is a more senior looking Human Resources lawyer, LAUREN
     BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look
     at each other for a beat.

                         LAUREN BRATBERG
               Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that
               we are here today but these are extra
               ordinary times as you very well must
               know.

                         ERIC
               I run risk management... it just doesn't
               seem like a natural place to start
               cutting.

                         HEATHER
               I hope you understand that this is in no
               way personal. A majority of this floor is
               being let go today.

                           ERIC
               OK

                         HEATHER
               Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to
               run through the details of what the firm
               is offering.

                           ERIC
                 OK

    LAUREN BRATBERG slides across the table a very thick
    severance contract agreement.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG
                 Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six
                 months severance at half your salary. You
                 will keep all unvested options that you
                 currently hold. Health will be extended
                 through that period. You have till

    She looks at her watch.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
                 4:47 to either take the offer or it will
                 be revoked. Do you understand?

                           ERIC
                 Yes.

                           LAUREN BRATBERG
                 Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the
                 highly sensitive nature of your work here
                 the firm has to take certain precautions
                 for security purposes that may seem
                 punitive in nature. I hope considering
                 your...

    SHE looks down at the piece of paper in front of her to fact
    check.

                            LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
                 ...over 19 years of service to the firm,
                 you will understand that these measures
                 are in no way a reflection of the firms'
                 feelings towards your performance or your
                 character.

                           ERIC
                 I'm sorry??

                           HEATHER
                 She's apologizing for what's about to
                 happen.

                 Your company email, access to the server,
                 access to the building, and your mobile
                 data and phone service will all be

    She points behind him and a smallish benign looking SECURITY
    GUARD is standing in the doorway.

                        LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
              will take you to your office so that you
              can clear out your personal belongings.

                        LAUREN BRATBERG
              The firm has worked out its transition
              plan and is prepared to move forward, but
              we appreciate your concern.

                        HEATHER
              We understand that this is very difficult
              and here is my card. Please contact me
              over the next few weeks if there is
              anything that I can do to help you
              through this transition in your life.

    They all stare at each other in silence for several long
    awkward beats.

                         SECURITY GUARD

    ERIC finally stands up and walks out with the guard and back
    over to his office.

    ERIC walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to
    clear his things out into a file box. The guard stands at the
    door. Eventually ERIC'S sympathetic yet still energetic
    immediate superior, WILL EMERSON comes to the door.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 If there was anything I coulda done, you
                 know I woulda done it.

                              ERIC
                 I know.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Well...

                           ERIC
                 One more thing... Who was it?

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Eric...

                           ERIC
                 Was it Rogers?

                           WILL EMERSON
                 You know me. I'm not gonna say...

                              ERIC
                 Robertson?

    WILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence.

                           ERIC (cont'd)
                 That cunt. I knew it. I never should have
                 gone to her last year.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad
                 luck. Right....?

                              ERIC
                 Yeah.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Good luck.

    They look at each other with respect but do not shake hands
    as WILL EMERSON starts to leave the office.

              Will?

                        WILL EMERSON
              Yeah.

                        ERIC
              You know I was just in the middle of a
              bunch of shit here that someone should
              really take a look at.

                        WILL EMERSON
              Eric, they are telling us that everyone
              has got to get out of here and leave
              everything behind. While we appreciate
              your concern, this is not your problem
              anymore. Alright? Good luck.

    ERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs
    up the last of his things, which does not take long, then
    stands and gets ready to walk out. He looks around and heads
    out into the cubicle area.

    Outside his office PETER and SETH are standing to say
    goodbye.

                        PETER
              Eric, I am very sorry.

                        SETH
              Yeah. Did they say what was going to
              happen with us?

              What?

                        ERIC
              No, it will be ugly around here for a
              while but you guys will be fine...

                        SETH
              Well, take care, Eric.

    Seth exits.

                        ERIC
              Well, I'll be seeing you around.

    walks out behind him.

    THEY both stand there in silence waiting for the elevator,
    then.

                           PETER
                 I just wanted to say thank you.

                           ERIC
                 That's not necessary.

                           PETER
                 Well it is... You were the person around
                 here that I...

    ERIC looks at him and understands. PETER turns around and
    begins to walk back toward his desk.

                           ERIC
                 I know.

    PETER turns back and ERIC reaches into one of his boxes and
    takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it
    to PETER.

                           ERIC (cont'd)
                 I was close to something here... But they
                 wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look.

    The elevator doors open and ERIC gets into the elevator. Just
    as the doors are closing he says...

                           ERIC (cont'd)
                 Be careful.

    The doors close.

    SAM ROGERS, a 57 year old executive, is sitting behind his
    desk looking out the window. WILL EMERSON gently knocks on
    the door, enters then sits on the couch.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Well, that was fucking hideous.

                 It's gonna get worse before it gets
                 better.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Really?

                              SAM ROGERS
                 Much.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Got any nicorettes? I'm out of
                 nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill
                 someone in about 10 minutes... You
                 alright?

                           SAM ROGERS
                 My dog is dying.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 I'm sorry?

                           SAM ROGERS
                 Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking
                 tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a
                 thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.

                              WILL EMERSON
                 Really?

                           SAM ROGERS
                 Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to
                 do about it.

    They both sit in silence and look out the window.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Well they're all gone.

                           SAM ROGERS
                 How many do we have left?

                           WILL EMERSON
                 Thirty-three.

                           SAM ROGERS
                 Make sure everyone is out there, I need
                 to say something.

                           WILL EMERSON
                 They are ready for you.

    WILL leaves SAM in his office. SAM looks as if he may not
    move, then snaps out of it.
                                                                 10.

    SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the
    trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people.
    Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast
    mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long
    pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture
    straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then
    builds.

                        SAM ROGERS
              You are all still here for a reason...
              Most of this floor was just sent home...
              forever. We have spent the last hour
              saying good-bye... they were good people
              and they were good at their jobs... but
              you all were better. Now they are gone.
              They are not to be thought of again. This
              is your opportunity. On every floor of
              this building and in every office from
              Hong Kong to London the same thing is
              happening. Before this is all done 3 of
              every ten guys who were standing between
              you and your boss's job are now gone.
              That is your opportunity. I've been at
              this place for thirty-four years and let
              me tell you that this will not be the
              last time you go through this. But you
              all are survivors... And that is how this
              firm over 107 years has always continued
              to grow stronger. So hold your heads
              high... and get back to work.

    He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his
    office and closes the door.

    SAM falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated
    daze. His eyes no longer believe what he says.

    ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes.
    There are other people streaming out the door doing the same
    thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then
    tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
    has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
    can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,
    SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed
    in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into
    the building. He can't help himself.

     SARAH does not respond.

                            ERIC (cont'd)
                  Sarah Robertson!

     This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she
     should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to
     her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his
     personal belongings in it.

                            ERIC (cont'd)
                  You shut off my phone???

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Eric... I didn't do anything.

     They stare at each other.

                               ERIC
                  Fuck you.

     They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little
     shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns
     and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the
     ground and walks away.

     Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting
     ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at
     his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting
     ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in
     his hand trying to decide whether to proceed.

                               SETH

                  around here.

                  I am.

     SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC
     kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks
     around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He
     has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
     opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
     begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame
     is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers
     flying by.

     In a locked off shot SETH and WILL are sitting on a couch
     staring forward. Figures cross frame and occasionally another
     banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the
     three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them.
     They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced.

     PETER is still working on the numbers, although his face
     starts to carry a more serious look. He is now wearing
     glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them.
     The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he
     takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes.

     SETH and WILL walk through the door and into the empty main
     trading floor. The lights are down and there is a cleaning
     person vacuuming in the far background. They walk over to
     PETER'S desk.

                         WILL EMERSON
               Hey, look who it is, burning the candle
               at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts
               planned though, so you can stop kissing
               my ass, honestly I don't even understand
               what you guys do.

                         PETER
               Will, I am so sorry to call you back but
               I really think..

                         WILL EMERSON
               Don't worry about it.

                         SETH
               Hey.

     WILL is a bit drunk but SETH looks at PETER'S face and
     realizes something is up.

                         SETH (cont'd)
               What's going on?

                         PETER

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Eric gave me this file before he left.

                         SETH
               Eric?

                         PETER
               Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite
               figure it out, then the last thing he
               says as the doors on the elevator close
               is `be careful'.

                         WILL EMERSON
               Be careful?

                         PETER
               So I'm obviously a little curious. So I
               get into it a bit and I realize that all
               he was missing was...well it's not good.

                  Go to model four, and it makes more
                  sense.

                  Oh.

     WILL is now paying closer attention, standing over their
     shoulder.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  What is this?

                            PETER
                  This is basically everything that we have
                  on our books at any given time. But what
                  Eric was trying to do here is work it for
                  levels of volatility that fall outside
                  the limits of our standard VAR model.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  What are those levels.

                            PETER
                  Well it's a fairly complicated...

                              WILL EMERSON
                  Simplify.

                            PETER
                  The volatility boundaries are basically
                  set using historic patterns then
                  stretching them out another 10-15%...
                  roughly.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  So what's happening?

                            SETH
                  We are starting to test those historic
                  patterns.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have
               called...

                         SAM ROGERS
               What's the problem?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I think you need to get down here.

                           SAM ROGERS
               What?

                           WILL EMERSON
               Sam...

                         SAM ROGERS
               It's 11:00 o'clock.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam.
               But you need to see this.

                           SAM ROGERS
               See what?

                           WILL EMERSON
               Well...

                         SAM ROGERS
               Email it to me.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I don't think that is a good idea.

     WILL'S last words hang in the air.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I'm on my way.
                                                                  21.


     INT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR
22                                                                   22

     SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it
     struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag
     and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their
     conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be
     listening.

                         SETH
               You want one?

                         PETER
               No.

     PETER gives him a bit of a look.

                         SETH
               What, we got them on our way to meet you
               at the office... we didn't know what the
               fuck you wanted to talk about...
                   (almost to himself)
               ... thought you might've gotten some
               chick pregnant or something.

                         PETER
               I haven't gotten laid in so long that's
               not possible at this point.

                         SETH
               I guess that's true.

     PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street
     enjoying the Thursday night.

                         PETER
               Look at these people.

                         SETH
               What?

                         PETER
               We are in here stressing our fucking
               heads off that the world as we know it is
               ending, and they've got no idea what's
               coming.

     SETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to
     project much in the way of stress.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Right?

                         SETH
               I try not to let work get to me.

22   CONTINUED:                                                     22

                            PETER
                  I've noticed that about you actually.

                            SETH
                  Look, we are twenty three years old...

                            PETER
                  Twenty-Seven.

                            SETH
                  Whatever, same thing, I made almost a
                  quarter of a million dollars last year...
                  for what... pushing some numbers around
                  on a computer screen, so a bunch of
                  glorified crack addicts could take that
                  information and pretend to understand it,
                  and then make a bet against some other
                  jock half way around the world who if he
                  wasn't doing this would probably be in
                  some OTB somewhere putting it all on
                  number seven. And at the end of the day
                  one guy loses and the other guy wins.

     PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long
     beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH:

                            PETER
                  You do know it's a little more
                  complicated than that?

     SETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the
     text.

                            SETH
                  It's Will... He wants to know if we've
                  found him? What do I tell him.

                            PETER
                  Tell him that we haven't found him.

     SAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking
     quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading
     floor. He looks around, then heads over to WILL EMERSON'S
     office where the light is on.

                  Hey.

     SAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on, then
     eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair. They
     wait for who goes first.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  So?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Eric Dale...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Oh Jesus...

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Before he was escorted out of the
                  building by security...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I had nothing to do with that.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I know.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm sorry, go on.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  So as he was leaving the building he
                  hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Who's Peter Sullivan again?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  One of Eric's guys.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Right.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  ...and tells him that he was almost on to
                  something but hasn't been able to figure
                  it out. So he gives him the disk and says
                  give it a try... but the last thing he
                  says as the doors to the elevator close
                  is `be careful'...

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Be careful?

               Yeah.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Be careful?

                            WILL EMERSON
               Yes.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Why?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Well... take a look.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Speak, you know I can't read those
               fucking things they put together.

                          WILL EMERSON
               Basically the kid dives right into the
               thing after your little pep talk, nice
               job by the way, and he seems to have
               nailed it.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Nailed it?

                         WILL EMERSON
               The kid figured out what Eric was
               missing. And...

                            SAM ROGERS
               And?

     WILL gives him a long pause.

                         WILL EMERSON
               ...it isn't good.

     WILL'S look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind
     WILL at his desk and look at the computer.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               As far as I can tell these here are the
               historical volatility index limits...
               which I guess our whole fucking trading
               model relies on pretty heavily... and we
               are so fucking levered up that if this
               thing starts getting outside those limits
               it gets ugly in a hurry.

                            SAM ROGERS
               How ugly?

               Real ugly.

                         SAM ROGERS
               And how close to those limits have we
               gotten?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Oh we're beyond close... We broke through
               five or six days over the last two weeks,
               but we've managed to stay on the upside
               of it... for now...

                            SAM ROGERS
               For now?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Well look what happens here when we get
               on the wrong side of it.

                         SAM ROGERS
               What am I looking at?

     WILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole
     lot of zeroes after it. SAM'S look says it all.

                         WILL EMERSON
               And that wouldn't even be that bad a day
               for us... historically speaking.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Is this right?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I don't know.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Where is Eric?

                         WILL EMERSON
               We shut his phone off.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Of course we did.

                         WILL EMERSON
               And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to
               his wife.

                          SAM ROGERS
               He's probably crying in a fucking beer
               somewhere.

     PETER and SETH are sitting at the bar each with a drink
     facing camera. There are women dancing in the background and
     one dancing in front of them, PETER and SETH look up
     occasionally.

                           PETER
               What now?

                         SETH
               We should probably tell Will he's not
               here.

                           PETER
               Yeah.

     They both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks.

     This time they are really stuck in traffic, the car is not
     moving at all.

     INT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWNCAR
27                                                                     27

     Eventually the car starts moving, and SETH'S phone starts
     buzzing with a text again.

                            SETH
                  He's freaking out. We need to get down
                  there.

     They look out into the city. Finally SETH reaches into his
     bag and takes out the forty in the paper bag and starts
     drinking the beer again. He takes a big sip.

                            SETH (cont'd)
                  What'a you think Rogers makes in a year?

     Long pause.

                            PETER
                  I have no idea?

                            SETH
                  Come on, play along.

                            PETER
                  I don't know what year?

                               SETH
                  Last year.

                            PETER
                  Three quarters of a million bucks?

                               SETH
                  Come on.

                               PETER
                  What?

                            SETH
                  Not even close.

                               PETER
                  More?

                               SETH
                  Yes.

                               PETER
                  A million?

                            SETH
                  Will Emerson made two and half million
                  bucks last year.

                               PETER
                  Fuck you.

     SETH looks at him showing he is serious.

                               PETER (cont'd)
                  Fuck you!

                               SETH
                  He did.

                            PETER
                  How do you know that?

                            SETH
                  He told me.

                            PETER
                  He just told you that?

                            SETH
                  Well I asked him.

                            PETER
                  Do you think that's true.

                               SETH
                  Probably.

                            PETER
                  That's fucked up.

                               SETH
                  Why?

                            PETER
                  Does that seem right to you?

                            PETER
               Jesus.

                          SETH
               So what do you think that means Rogers
               puts away?

                         PETER
               I have no idea.

     They both just look straight forward, SETH takes a big gulp
     of the beer.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               This fucking traffic. We should have
               taken a the subway.

     The doors of the elevator open and PETER and SETH look up as
     WILL EMERSON and SAM ROGERS are standing in front of them
     about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed
     with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are
     ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the
     morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag.
     Will looks at it. They share a glancing smile. WILL and SAM
     step into the elevator keeping the guys in it.

                            WILL EMERSON
               Gentlemen?

                         SAM ROGERS
               You're coming with us.

                         SETH
               Will. Mr. Rogers.

                         WILL EMERSON
               Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is
               Peter Sullivan.

     They all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until:

                            PETER
                  Will?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Yes?

                            PETER
                  Where are we going?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Going to get a second opinion on your
                  work Peter.

     PETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned.
     The doors open and they exit.

     SETH looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find
     a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway
     that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn
     into a small conference room that has no windows. It is
     claustrophobic.

     INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     There are four people sitting at the table. They stand.
     Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.

                            ALL PRESENT
                  Slight hellos, etc.

     They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of
     paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of
     the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43
     year old, although carries himself with intense confidence.
     He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees
     roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk
     management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from
     outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC.
     Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year
     old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They
     are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence.

     SETH COUGHS.

     ALL PRESENT look down at him.

                            JARED COHEN
                  So Sam, what do you have for us?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Well... it should be here in a minute.
                  Finding someone in the copy room at this
                  hour was a little bit of a challenge.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well why don't we start by introducing
                  everyone then.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  OK.

                            JARED COHEN
                  This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our
                  chief risk management officer, Ramesh
                  Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of
                  the firm's in house counsel.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Nice to meet you all. This is Will
                  Emerson my head of trading, and this
                  is...

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They
                  work in our risk department.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Where is Eric Dale?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  He was let go today.

     JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been
     her call to let ERIC go, she nods yes.

                            JARED COHEN
                  So who's left in your risk department?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  As of today that would be Peter and our
                  junior analyst Seth...?

     Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH. Their
     inexperience glares back.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Really?

     JARED looks back at SARAH, then the room goes silent again.
     Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door.

                            COPY ROOM GUY
                  Will Emerson?

               Here. Please just give one to everyone,
               thanks.

     The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the
     room.

                         SAM ROGERS
               So apparently Eric had been working on
               this for some time but was unable to
               finish it, as he was leaving the building
               today he gave the program to Peter here,
               and told him to see what he thought.
               Peter figured a few things out that Eric
               seemed to be missing and this is what
               came out.

                         JARED COHEN
               Where is Eric Dale now?

                         SAM ROGERS
               He's been unreachable since he left the
               office.

     JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of
     them and start reviewing. SAM, WILL, PETER, and SETH just sit
     in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as
     they all read. This goes on for a full very long minute.
     Finally:

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Peter this is your work?

                         PETER
               Mainly Mr. Dale's...

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               But this draft is yours?

                         PETER
               Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's
               original model. But yes.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               And what is your background?

                         PETER
               Background?

                         PETER
               I have been with the firm for two years
               working with Eric that whole time... But
               I hold a doctorate in engineering,
               specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with
               a Bachelors from Penn.

                         JARED COHEN
               What's a specialty in propulsion?

                         PETER
               Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a
               study in the way that friction ratios
               effect steering outcomes in aeronautical
               use under reduced gravity loads.

     Long silence.

                         JARED COHEN
               So you are a rocket scientist?

     The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe.

                         PETER
               Um... I was... yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               How did you end up here?

                         PETER
               Well it's all just numbers really, you're
               just changing what you're adding up...
               and if I may speak freely the money is
               considerably more attractive here.

     JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his
     tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.

                         JARED COHEN
               What time is it?

                            RAMESH
               It's 2:15.

     SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit.

                         JARED COHEN
               What do you have in exposure right now,
               tonight?

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't know... between 900 and 1.3...
               roughly.

               If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct...

     RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through
     the numbers and takes a beat too long.

                         PETER
               1.215 Trillion.

     RAMESH checks his number.

                            RAMESH
               Yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by
               the fact that you two haven't said
               anything that the math checks out?

     JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to
     RAMESH. She looks back.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
               Look    we'd need a little more time to go
               over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to
               know    what he's doing. And I don't have to
               tell    you that this is a problem.

                         JARED COHEN
               Thank you for that. What time is it?

                            RAMESH
               2:16.

                            JARED COHEN
               Fuck me!

     Jared stands up and walks around the small room. The rest of
     the room goes silent. Finally:

                         JARED COHEN (cont'd)
               Sam how long under normal operations
               would it take your people to clear that
               from our books?

                            SAM ROGERS
               What?

                         JARED COHEN
               The 1.2 trillion.

                            SAM ROGERS
               All of it?

                                                                   35.

                           JARED COHEN
               Yes.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't know, a couple weeks?

                           JARED COHEN
               Weeks?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Yes. But as you certainly know our
               business is selling AND buying. It
               doesn't work for very long without both
               components. If we suddenly stop buying
               for a day or two that just doesn't hide
               under the rug, it gets out and this whole
               this thing comes to a end... and right
               quick.

                         JARED COHEN
               I understand.

                           SAM ROGERS
               Do you?

                         JARED COHEN
               How many traders do we have left between
               your floor and Petersen's?

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't know, sixty.

     RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this
     conversation has been taking place.

                         RAMESH
               Jared I've just been looking here a
               little closer, and it's these VAR numbers
               that are really setting this thing off.

     JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his
     head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.

                         JARED COHEN
               Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.

     JARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long
     moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is
     gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He
     comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat.

                           JARED COHEN (cont'd)
               Please...

                         RAMESH
               I was just saying, and just speaking
               completely off the record here, it won't
               be long before someone else starts
               putting these in and sees the exact same
               thing we are looking at here. If they
               haven't already.

     Pause.

                          JARED COHEN
               Understood... And Sarah, what value would
               you allow to be placed on those assets
               that might be left on the books, if they
               had to be?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Why would they still be on the books?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Because suddenly no one wants to buy
               them.

                         JARED COHEN
               Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking
               break, all at once?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Without an active market, it could take
               weeks, months for me to value them
               correctly. You'd have to go block by
               block.

                         SAM ROGERS
               It's a very simple business Jared. You
               and I talked about this last year...

     JARED turns around suddenly and cuts him off.

                         JARED COHEN
               Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??

                         SETH
               Seth.

                         JARED COHEN
               Seth, Could you please excuse us for a
               few minutes.

     They stand up and start to exit the room.


                         JARED COHEN (cont'd)
               Oh and Peter? Who else has seen this?

     PETER thinks that through.

                         PETER
               No one... besides us here.

                         JARED COHEN
               And Mr. Dale.

                         PETER
               Yes.

                         JARED COHEN
               And can it really be that we don't know
               where Eric Dale is?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he
               hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut
               off his phone today.

                         JARED COHEN
               Perfect. Well, I need to know where he
               is.

     WILL, SETH, and PETER leave the room and close the door
     behind them.

     They cross the hallway and sit on a bench staring out the
     window. They talk very quietly.

                         SETH
               Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?

                         WILL EMERSON
               He's Sam's boss.

                          SETH
               He looks like he's fifteen years old. How
               old is he?

                         WILL EMERSON
               He's like forty.

                         PETER
               How does that happen?

               Oh it happens all the time. Except to me.
               Kid's a fucking killer.

                  Jared you can't do what you are thinking
                  about doing.

                            JARED COHEN
                  What if we don't have a choice?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  What does that mean? Fuck you... you
                  don't have a choice.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers
                  Sam??

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yes, but what the hell do I know.

     JARED COHEN comes back over to the table and picks up the
     packet.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but
                  to me these numbers don't add up.

                            RAMESH
                  If I may I'd like to take some time
                  before we...

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Jared we can't answer that yet.

                  Are you fucking kidding me... this is
                  exactly what we've...

     SARAH now cuts him off abruptly.

                  We need a little time before we can give
                  you our conclusion.

     SARAH closes the issue off with another look to JARED.

                            JARED COHEN
                  OK. We meet in 45 minutes.

                  Yes, here it is.

     SAM slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take
     a second to follow it.

                            JARED COHEN
                  And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me
                  very uneasy knowing he is out there right
                  now wanting to put a knife in our backs
                  while he's not even aware he's holding
                  the knife in his hand.

     SARAH and RAMESH leave the room as SAM is left alone with
     JARED.

                  What are you going to do?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Are you going to call him?

     They both look at each other for a long beat. Finally.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I already did.

     SAM puts his hand on JARED'S shoulder briefly. They part.

     THEY are all still smoking and looking out over the city.
     Finally WILL stands up and goes over to the edge and looks
     over. He jumps up and sits on the edge.

                  Did you know the fear most people feel
                  when they stand on the edge like this is
                  not actually a fear that they will fall
                  but instead it's the subconscious fearing
                  that they might jump? ....It's a fear of
                  losing faith.

                             SETH
                  Well that's a little deep and depressing,
                  thank you.

                             WILL EMERSON
                  Yeah well, I can get a little dark
                  sometimes.

     WILL jumps down and comes back over to sit down. They stare
     out again.

               You can't... it's impossible. But they'll
               figure out a way. I've been at this place
               for ten years and I've seen some things
               that you wouldn't believe... and when all
               is said and done... they don't lose
               money. They don't care if everyone else
               does, but they won't.

               Yeah... I did.

                         PETER
               What do you do with all that money?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I don't know really. It goes pretty
               quick. You learn to spend what's in your
               pocket.

                         SETH
               Two and a half million goes quickly?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Well the tax man takes half of it up
               front. So now you got what... million and
               a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I
               gave 150 to my parents to live off, so
               now you got what??

                         PETER
               Eight hundred.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I bought a car last year for 150.
               Probably another 100 eating... 25 on

               I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers,

               Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was
               able to write most of it off, as
               entertainment.

     With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the
     building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes
     sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over
     their heads.

     They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference
     room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with
     people along one side of the table. There are a team of five
     lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board
     members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits
     RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of
     the table is empty.

     waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking
     into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is
     not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.
     He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however
     tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the
     length of the room, everyone half stands up.

               Please sit down.

     He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in

               matter needs to be handled urgently, so
               urgently in fact that it probably should
               have been addressed weeks ago...

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  but that is spilt milk under the bridge.
                  So why doesn't someone please try to
                  explain to me what's the problem here?

     Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks
     up.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if
                  you look here at the top page of this
                  printout...

     He cuts him off.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Jared, it's a little early for all that,
                  how bout in English? ... Actually I'd
                  like to hear from the guy who put this
                  thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it?
                  Does he speak English?

                             JARED COHEN
                  Sir?

                            JOHN TULD
                  I'd like to speak to the analyst who
                  seems to have stumbled across this mess.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.

     JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in
     the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look.

                             PETER
                  Sir.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Ah, there he is.

                             PETER
                  Yes sir.

                            JOHN TULD
                  How old are you Mr. Sullivan?

                            PETER
                  I'm twenty-seven sir.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Please call me John.

                             PETER
                  Yes sir.

45   CONTINUED: (2)                                                45

                         JOHN TULD
               So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me
               what you think is going on here, and
               please speak as you might to a young
               child or a golden retriever, I didn't get
               here on my brains I can assure you of
               that.

     PETER is very nervous.

                         PETER
               Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not
               know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an
               associate in the risk assessment and
               management office at MBS

                         JOHN TULD
               Now you lost me at M...

                          PETER
               Sorry...

                         JOHN TULD
               I was joking Mr. Sullivan.

                         PETER
               Yes... Well as you probably know over the
               last 36-40 months the firm has begun
               packaging new MBS products that combine
               several different traunches of rating
               classification in one tradable security.
               This has been very profitable as I
               imagine you noticed.

                          JOHN TULD
               I have.

                         PETER
               Well the firm is currently doing a
               considerable amount of this business
               every day. The problem, which is I guess
               why we are here tonight, is that it takes
               us... the firm... almost a month to layer
               these products correctly thereby posing a
               challenge from a risk management
               standpoint.

                         JOHN TULD
               And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

                         PETER
               We have to hold these assets on our books
               longer than we might ideally like to.

                                                                 50.

                          JOHN TULD
               Yes.

                         PETER
               But the key factor is these are
               essentially just mortgages, so that has
               allowed us to push the leverage
               considerably beyond what you might be
               willing, or allowed to do in any other
               circumstance, thereby pushing the risk
               profile without raising any red flags.

                         JOHN TULD
               And how far have we pushed that profile
               tonight Mr. Sullivan?

                         PETER
               We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion
               dollars... at MBS alone.

                         JOHN TULD
               Give or take.

                         PETER
               Give or take.

                         JOHN TULD
               Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and
               give me a little rope here, what I am
               guessing that your report here says is
               that considering the, shall we say bumpy
               road, we've been on the last week or so
               that the numbers that your brilliant co-
               workers up the line ahead of you had come
               up with in the past don't seem to make
               much sense anymore considering what's
               taking place today?

                          PETER
               Actually not taking place today but
               what's already taken place over the last
               two weeks.

                         JOHN TULD
               So what you're saying is it's already
               happened?

                          PETER
               Sort of.

                         JOHN TULD
               And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say
               that means for us here?

                         PETER
               Well, that's where it becomes a
               projection. But...

     PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.

                         JOHN TULD
               You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

                         PETER
               Well... sir... if those assets were to
               decrease by just 25 percent, and remain
               on our books... well... that loss would
               be greater than the current market
               capitalization of this company.

     The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard.
     He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into
     the city.

                         JOHN TULD
               So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is
               that the music appears to be about to
               stop and we are going to be holding the
               biggest bag of stinking shit ever
               assembled in the history of capitalism?

     Everyone looks back at PETER.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Mr. Sullivan?

                         PETER
               Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that
               way but let me clarify using your
               analogy, what this model shows is the
               music, so to speak, just slowing, if the
               music were to stop, as you put it, then
               this model would not be even close to
               that scenario. It would be considerably
               worse.

                         JOHN TULD
               Well let me tell you something Mr.
               Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm
               sitting here in this chair with you all,
               why I get the big bucks, so to speak?

                         PETER
               Yes.

                         JOHN TULD
               I'm here for one reason and one reason
               only.

     JOHN TULD continues to look out over the city for a long
     beat.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               I'm here to guess what the music is gonna
               do a week, month, a year from now. That's
               it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid...
               standing here tonight... that I don't
               hear... a... thing... just silence.

     The room falls completely still for at least half a minute.
     Then JOHN TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more
     upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               So, now that we know that the music has
               stopped, what can we do about it?

     Long Silence.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this
               is where you are supposed to step back
               in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr.
               Sullivan today.

     JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               What have you got for us?

     Long pause.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               What have I told you since the first day
               you walked into my office? (pause) That
               there are three ways to make a living in
               this business... Be first, be smarter, or
               cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even
               though I like to think we have got some
               pretty smart people in this building of
               the two remaining options, it sure is a
               hell of alot easier to just be first.

     The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the
     window.

                         JARED COHEN
               Sell it all today...

     JOHN TULD smiles just a bit. Then turns.

                         JOHN TULD
               Is that even possible Sam?

     SAM looks across the room at JOHN TULD, they have known each
     other for 35 years.

                         SAM ROGERS
               It is, but at what cost?

                           JOHN TULD
               I'll pay.

                           SAM ROGERS
               Really?

     JOHN and SAM look and read each other.

                         JOHN TULD
               I think so.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Almost a trillion bucks of paper?

                         JOHN TULD
               Where does it come back to us?

                         SAM ROGERS
               Everywhere.

                         JOHN TULD
               Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
               what your boy down here just said... if I
               made you... how would you do it?

     SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.

                         SAM ROGERS
               You bring the traders in for their normal
               6:30 meeting and you be honest with them,
               they're gonna know it's the end either
               way, so you'd have to throw them a bone,
               and a pretty big one. You'd have to come
               out of the gate storming... 40 percent
               done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your
               positions need to be gone by eleven,
               cause by lunch the word will be out. No
               swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock
               you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar,
               if you're lucky, and the feds will be in
               here looking up your ass and trying to
               slow us down.

                           JOHN TULD
               Ramesh?

     He looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table.

               They'll slow you down but it's yours to
               sell. They can't stop you.

                         SAM ROGERS
               John... let's just say we pull that off,
               which is saying something... the real
               question is... who are we selling this
               to?

                         JOHN TULD
               The same people you've been selling this
               to for the last two years... and whoever
               else will buy it.

     They look at each other to see if they understand each other.

                         SAM ROGERS
               If you do this you've killed that market
               for years. It's over.

               (Nods.)

                         SAM ROGERS
               And you are selling something you know
               has no value.

                         JOHN TULD
                   (cuts him off cold)
               We are selling to willing buyers at the
               current fair market price, so that WE may
               survive, Sam.

                         SAM ROGERS
               You'll never sell a thing to any one of
               them again.

                         JOHN TULD
               I understand.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Do you?

                         JOHN TULD
               Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it!

     The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them
     go at it. Silence.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               It's 4:00... Jared you've got till 5:00
               to break this down and draw me up a plan.

                As of today he is no longer with the
                firm.

                          JARED COHEN
                We have been trying to locate him.

                          JOHN TULD
                So he is just out there with this

      JOHN TULD looks down the lawyer side of the table to a secret
      service looking guy.

                             JOHN TULD
                Carmelo?

                Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30.

                             LOUIS CARMELO
                Done.

                          JOHN TULD
                OK, meet back here in an hour.

      Everyone stands up and begins to scatter.

                   Never really did it for me actually.

                             JOHN TULD
                   Really?

                             SAM ROGERS
                   Always been kinda a grass and tree guy.

                             JOHN TULD
                   I've always loved this place. Ever since
                   I arrived. Everything about it.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   I can't say I feel that about anyplace
                   actually.

                             JOHN TULD
                   Are you going to be able to come on board
                   here Sam?

      They look at each other.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   I'm not sure John. This is really ugly.

                             JOHN TULD
                   You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell.
                   That's what we do. It's not complicated.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   Exactly. And you damn well know that you
                   don't make a sale unless you think the
                   guy is gonna come back for more, and
                   tomorrow we are done.

      JOHN looks out and then over at SAM and decides whether or
      not to proceed.

                             JOHN TULD
                   This is it Sam.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   You keep saying that, what is that
                   supposed to mean?

                             JOHN TULD

                This won't be the last `situation' I will
                be having this week. It's just the start.

                          SAM ROGERS
                It's only the start because we are
                starting it.

                          JOHN TULD
                Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not
                this time. The numbers just don't add up
                anymore.

                          SAM ROGERS
                Well I agree with you there, I've been
                saying that for years.

                          JOHN TULD
                I mean if this kid can come up with
                this...?

                          SAM ROGERS
                I don't think I can go in knowing what I
                know and put the hammer down on these
                guys like this.

                          JOHN TULD
                Oh please, when did you become so soft.

                          SAM ROGERS
                Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

      The word panic slaps JOHN TULD in the face. He then calms.

                          JOHN TULD
                If you're the first one out the door Sam,
                it's not called panicking

      JOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM.

                          SAM ROGERS
                Look, I obviously don't have all the
                information that you do. But I think this
                could destroy this firm.

               That's where I'm headed right now,
               downstairs to work on it with my guys.

               No, you and I... with Tuld.

               I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's
               not the way I've ever done this.

                   (with distinct sarcasm)
               Please.

               He knows where we both have stood on this
               all along. There's nothing more to do.

     This pushes a button with her.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               That's exactly my point, and knowing what
               was discussed by both you and I with him,
               I don't see how that can possibly you
               with anything but a false sense of
               comfort.

               I'm not looking for a sense of comfort
               here, Sarah. I don't think there is one
               to be found.

     The elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off. Sarah
     walks after her, but turns to Tuld first.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               So again, what's the strategy here?

               On this particular front, I'm just not
               sure there's much left to do.

                            PETER
                  I need a little real air.

                            SETH
                  Probably a good idea.

                            PETER
                  Will, is that alright?

                             WILL EMERSON
                  Alright?

                            PETER
                  If I get out of here for a minute?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Yeah. Are you kidding? It's not a prison.
                  Do you want me to hold your hand?

     Peter exits. Will's phone rings. Will stares at it and
     finally picks it up. We only hear his part of the
     conversation.

                            WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
                  Will Emerson...Yes...Oh thank you...I
                  understand...OK.

     SAM comes to the door of WILL'S office. He looks at
     everyone's faces.

                             SAM ROGERS
                  What?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  That was Eric's wife. He's alive, he's
                  home. He doesn't want to talk to us. And
                  he doesn't know she called me.

     They all look to SAM to see what to do.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Where's he live?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  The heights.

     SAM ROGERS looks at his watch.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               Should we call Tuld's guy?

                         SAM ROGERS
               No... it's Eric... the last thing we need
               is those guys going over there, you two
               go try to get him.

     SAM points to WILL and SETH.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               But you've got to be back here by 6:00.

                          WILL EMERSON
               OK.

     SARAH is sitting behind her desk looking down at something.
     JOHN TULD comes to the door and knocks lightly. She looks up
     surprised to see him.

                         JOHN TULD
               May I come in?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Please, sit.

     JOHN TULD closes the door and sits in front of her desk.
     Looks around, then looks right at her.

                         JOHN TULD
               So... we are going to do this thing.

                          SARAH ROBERTSON
               OK.

                         JOHN TULD
               It's going to be tight.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Is Sam on board?

                          JOHN TULD
               Not yet.

     TULD pauses.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Sarah, I need a head to feed to these
               traders... and the board... this morning.

     SARAH looks up.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Is it me or Cohen?

                              JOHN TULD
                  It's you.

     They stare at each other, she does not flinch.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Of course you are well aware I filtered
                  several warnings for you and Cohen over a
                  year ago on this?

                            JOHN TULD
                  I'm not sure that's the best path for you
                  to be taking at this point... you're
                  going to be taken care of here...

                            JOHN TULD
                  Obviously it's quite complicated.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  John I was told that in no uncertain
                  terms...

                            JOHN TULD
                  It was all a very grey area.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  It was actually made very clear at the
                  time, by you and I and Cohen.

                            JOHN TULD
                  I'd really prefer that you didn't fight
                  me on this...

     TULD pauses, they look at each other.

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  We all fucked this one up pretty good...

                              SARAH ROBERTSON
                  Yes.

                            JOHN TULD
                  We need you to stay here till this is all
                  done and the markets close.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
                  I understand.

               They'll go over the numbers with you
               downstairs... Good luck.

     JOHN TULD looks at her. There is a security person standing
     at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks
     out.

     WILL and SETH are sitting waiting for WILL'S car to be
     brought up. As they wait they see JARED COHEN come out of the
     elevator and walk towards them.

                         SETH
               Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this
               way.

                         WILL
               What does wonderboy want?

     WILL stands up and walks over to JARED.

                         JARED COHEN
               Do you have a minute?

                         WILL
               We're heading to get Eric Dale.

                         JARED COHEN
               I know. I just need a second.

     THEY walk away from SETH.

                         WILL
               What is it?

                         JARED COHEN
               Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not
               be willing to step up and do the right
               thing here.

     WILL looks around the garage, than back at JARED.

                         WILL
               I don't think that's ever been a problem.

                         JARED COHEN
               Of course it hasn't, but during acute
               situations, such as this, often what is
               right can take on multiple
               interpretations.

     They look at each other for a long beat as WILL sizes up the
     question. In the background the squeals of tires on concrete
     are heard.

                            WILL
                  Sam will step up.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I know he will...but if he doesn't...

     As the question stands unfinished Will's convertible flies
     into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to JARED and WILL.
     The attendant gets out and before WILL has a chance JARED
     hands the attendant a tip. JARED then looks back at WILL who
     is waiting to get in the car.

                            JARED COHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  But if he doesn't, we need to know that
                  you will.

                            WILL
                  That I will what?

                             JARED COHEN
                  Step up.

     WILL climbs into the car and shuts the door. He looks at
     JARED through the open window with SETH now sitting next to
     him within earshot.

                            WILL
                  I have no doubt Sam will make the right
                  choice. And if it makes you feel any
                  better he and I have always had the same
                  interpretation of what's right...no
                  matter how acute the situation.

     WILL puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage
     leaving JARED standing there.

     The floor is totally empty. Slow guitar music playing. The
     camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many
     different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer
     screens. It turns the corner and then finally enters SAM'S
     office.

     He is totally asleep. He has headphones on and looks like he
     could be dead he is so passed out. The music suddenly changes
     pace and the volume change startles him up. He looks around.

      SAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to
      wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to
      wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror.
      The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the
      door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go
      to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to
      SAM.

                             JOHN TULD
                   There he is.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   John.

      SAM walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and
      face. Finally he looks up.

                             SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                   So what's it look like John?

      The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD'S
      liking.

                             JOHN TULD
                   Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   What does that mean?

                             JOHN TULD
                   It means, as you very well know, that you
                   are a very important piece of this
                   puzzle.

      They look directly at each other.

                             JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                   Here.

      JOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper. SAM opens
      it and looks at it.

                             SAM ROGERS
                   That's very generous.

                            JOHN TULD
                  It's not a gift. I need to know you are
                  with me on this.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm with the firm John.

     JOHN TULD is now taking a far more forceful stance, almost
     blocking the doorway.

                            JOHN TULD
                  I won't get what I need out of your boys
                  today unless they believe you... unless
                  they believe in you completely.

     He stares at SAM.

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  Are you in?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I told you I have my reservations.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Well you can't have any reservations.

     They both stare at each other.

                            JOHN TULD (cont'd)
                  And I need to know now.

     SAM looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his
     hand, then long and hard at JOHN TULD.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm with the firm completely John, as I
                  always have been. Excuse me.

     SAM slightly moves JOHN out of the way and then he exits, the
     door closes.

     There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the
     buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size
     headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders
     around the almost completely empty city and the further he
     walks the less his face changes.

     PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart.
     He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The

                               PETER
                  Thank you.

     PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he
     see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is
     immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps
     slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other
     squarely.

                               LUCY
                  Hey...

                            PETER
                  Hi. It's really good to see you.

     She has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be
     a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking.

                            LUCY
                  You too. You look tired.

                               PETER
                  I am.

                            LUCY
                  What are you doing here?

                            PETER
                  I never left work. Just had to get out
                  for a walk.

                            LUCY
                  You're still working there?

     This cuts him a bit, why wouldn't he be?

                            PETER
                  Yes, of course...

                            LUCY
                  Oh. I thought...

                            PETER
                  How are you? Are you happy? You look
                  happy.

                               LUCY
                  I am.

               Well, I should get back... How's your
               father?

     She is pleasantly surprised by this gesture.

                         LUCY
               He's good. Thanks for asking.

                         PETER
               OK. Be safe.

     He starts to leave.

                         LUCY
               Hey... You got any inside tips for him?

     This stops PETER dead in his tracks. His world tightens yet
     clarifies. Finally.

                           PETER
               Sell.

     She looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a
     smile as he says this. They then give a small kiss on the
     cheek, and part.

     INT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE - DAY

     SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She
     calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes
     it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass
     wall separating her office from the floor giving herself
     total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She
     reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically
     preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work.
     She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her
     face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give
     way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't
     believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods
     her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no
     tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it
     isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to
     herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real.
     She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can
     only openly express even to herself... nothing.

     WILL and SETH pull up in front of a very nice large
     townhouse. They both look up at the house dreading going in.

                  I hope it was with cash.

                  I think I should stay here.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Get out of the fucking car.

                            SETH
                  I just don't think it would be
                  appropriate.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Appropriate? Get the fuck out of the car.

                            SETH
                  Really?

     WILL gets out of the car and walks slowly up the stairs. He
     is about to knock on the door when from behind him he hears
     ERIC coming walking up the block. He is still in his work
     clothes and it looks like it's been a long night.

                            ERIC
                  What are you doing here?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Peter finished that model you were
                  working on.

                            ERIC
                  Really?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  It's created a bit of a shit storm.

                            ERIC
                  Yeah, I bet.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Do you want to see it... the model?

                  No. But I'm pretty sure what it says.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Do you think he's right?

                  I'm sure he's right.

     They both sit down on the stoop.

                  Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting
                  of the partners tonight. John Tuld has
                  decided to liquidate our entire position.

                            WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
                  Today.

     ERIC'S face doesn't show much emotion. But he is surprised
     and sincere.

                            ERIC
                  Well, I am very sorry to hear that.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  They want me to get you back there, they
                  are worried about you being out here.

                      (with pleasant disgust)
                  Please.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I'm just saying.

                         WILL EMERSON
               No, I didn't.

                         ERIC
               I was an engineer by trade.

               It cut out 35 miles each way of extra
               driving to get from Wheeling to New
               Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000

               year saved.

     goes.

               I completed that project in 1986... 22
               years ago. Over the life of that one
               bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million...
               240 thousand miles that haven't had to be
               driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour
               that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020
               days... so that one little bridge has
               saved the people of those two communities
               a combined 1531 years of their lives not
               wasted in the car... give or take.

                            ERIC
               Thanks.

                  And Eric...don't beat yourself up too bad
                  over this shit.

                             ERIC
                  Yeah.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  Who the fuck knows.

     ERIC nods.

                            WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
                  Some people like driving the long way
                  home.

     He gets in his car and drives away.

     INT. WILL EMERSON'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY

     WILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan
     which spans up and out in front of them through the
     windshield. There is a long silence, and finally.

                            SETH
                  So, am I getting fired?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I don't know.

     Very long pause, then he looks over at SETH and decides
     whether to tell the truth.

                            WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
                  Probably...yes...almost definitely.

                             SETH
                  Are you?

                             WILL EMERSON
                  No.

     This clearly hits SETH but he recovers quickly.

                             SETH
                  Oh.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  It's not personal, you're just in the
                  wrong place at the wrong time, the young
                  guys are always the first to go. Nothing
                  I say is gonna make you feel any better.

                              SETH
                  I get it.

     SETH looks over at WILL and around at the interior of the
     luxury car and then back into the city.

                            SETH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  When did you know this is what you wanted
                  to do?

     He thinks that through.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  The first time I made 36 million dollars
                  for the firm in the last eleven minutes
                  of the trading day.

                              SETH
                  Fuck me.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming
                  from three days away. I took my time. I
                  was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it
                  was beautiful.

                            SETH
                  How did you learn to do that?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could
                  be gone tomorrow.

     WILL looks out again at the city then to SETH.

                            WILL EMERSON (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Look man I'm sorry about this.

                            SETH
                  Don't be, you're not doing it to me.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  I know...but I'm still sorry. At least
                  you'll have some decent cash to walk away
                  with.

                            SETH
                  Only if we can get this done, right?

                            WILL EMERSON
                  We'll get it done.

                              SETH
                  How?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm trying to figure that out right now.

                         SETH
               There aren't really enough willing buyers
               out there right now.

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm trying to think of every last one of
               them I can and then I'll make them
               willing.

     This line sits there for a minute and WILL looks out onto the
     city.

                         SETH
               Are you ok with that?

                         WILL EMERSON
               I'm about to completely fuck guys I've
               been doing business with for fifteen
               years so no I'm not exactly ok with it.
               But look, every last one of them would do
               the same thing to me in a second...so it
               is what it is.

                         SETH
               I guess. And what about everyone else?

                         WILL EMERSON
               Everyone else?

                         SETH
               Normal people.

                          WILL EMERSON
               What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth.

     WILL looks over at SETH, sizing him up, looking to see if he
     has what it takes.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               Look, If you want to do this with your
               life, and do it well, you need to believe
               that you are necessary. And you are. If
               people want to live like this...with
               their big cars and these houses that they
               haven't even paid for. Then you are
               necessary. The only reason they can
               continue to live like kings is because
               we've got our fingers on the scale in
               THEIR favor. And if I were to take my
               finger off...

               Then the whole world gets really fucking
               fair, really fucking quickly. And no one
               wants that, they say they do...but they
               don't. They want what we're giving them,
               but they also want to play innocent and
               pretend they have no idea how we get it.
               And that's more hypocrisy than I can
               swallow. So fuck em.

     Long look out at the city ahead.

                         WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
               And tomorrow if this all goes south
               they'll crucify us for being reckless,
               but if we are wrong and everything get's
               back on track. They'll be laughing their
               arses off at us for being the biggest
               bunch of pussies that God ever let
               through the door.

     He is trying to convince himself as much as SETH. They both
     look out the windows.

                         SETH
               Are we gonna be wrong on this one?

     WILL looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above
     them.

                         WILL
               No...they're all gonna get fucked.

     PETER is still walking around on the street with the music
     playing. He crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza.
     As he approaches the building he sees SAM ROGERS standing in
     front having a cigarette. He walks towards him and then
     finally decides to take off the headphones. The music stops
     and the wind kicks in.

                         PETER
               Hello.

                         SAM ROGERS

                  I don't smoke.

     But PETER holds his place comfortably.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  That's good. I don't much either.

                            PETER
                  It's kinda beautiful out right now.

     They both look out. Slow pacing.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yeah, I guess it is...
                      (almost surprised)
                  I've never really liked this town much.

                            PETER
                  How long have you been here?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Forty years.

                            PETER
                  I think it's beautiful. The whole place.
                  Forty years, that's something... Are you
                  tired?

                             SAM ROGERS
                  Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard
                  as you do.

                            PETER
                  That's not true.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  No it is, actually.

     Long silence.

                            PETER
                  Are we all getting fired after today?

     SAM looks out and thinks about it for a while.

                              SAM ROGERS
                  Probably.

                            PETER
                  They're going to fire you?

                  I don't really want to go back in there
                  just yet.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I understand that.

     Long beat.

                  He is a nice person.

                  Have you told him what's about to happen?

     They look at each other to check the nature of the question.

                  No... I hadn't even thought of it.

               That's very true.

               Now that's something.

                         PETER
               Yeah... it is.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Did he want you to do that?

                            PETER
               No, never.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Oh.

                         PETER
               He was always a pretty miserable guy
               actually...

     Another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building.
     Peter looks up.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               They're all coming in now.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Yes they are.

                         PETER
               Have you ever done anything like this
               before?

                         SAM ROGERS
               No... never.... not even close.

     SAM takes a deep drag off his cigarette.

                          PETER
               Oh...

                          SAM ROGERS
               Yeah.

     PETER looks down at his watch, then thinks about what to say
     next.

                         PETER
               Do you really think this is the only...
               or the... right thing to do?

                          SAM ROGERS
               For who?

                         PETER
               I'm not sure.

     Now SAM looks around and thinks.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I'm not either.

                         PETER
               So this is gonna make a pretty big mess
               of it, then?

                         SAM ROGERS
               I don't even want to think about it.

               Yeah.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Just doesn't quite seem...

     Takes another long drag.

                            PETER
               I know.

                         SAM ROGERS
               (Very slightly shakes his head.)

                         PETER
               Well. I guess we should get back.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Yeah.

     They both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn
     and head into the building.

     The camera follows them through the long marble lobby.
     Through security. They comfortably don't talk to each other
     the entire time till they get into the elevator.

     Staring ahead in silence.

                          SAM ROGERS
               Well good luck, you know, in the
               future... Seems like you'll probably be
               just fine.

                            PETER
               Thank you.

     The doors open.

     A very tight shot of SETH sitting fully clothed on the toilet
     with the lid on. He is crying very, very intensely but almost
     silently. He puts his head in his hands and just once or
     twice lets out a loud noise.

     Eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the
     person go over to the sink and start running water. SETH
     tries to stop himself from crying. Eventually he accepts that
     the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and
     walks over to the sinks. JARED is standing in front of the
     mirror with his shirt off shaving. His new shirt and tie are
     on a hanger next to him. SETH walks up to a sink next to him
     and it is very obvious that he has been crying. He undoes his
     collar and starts to wash his face. Finally JARED speaks.

                            JARED COHEN
                  You alright?

     SETH sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in
     the mirror.

                            SETH
                  You just fired me.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I'm sorry...

                            SETH
                  This is all I've ever wanted to do.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Really?

                            SETH
                  Yes...

     This hits JARED just a touch.

                            JARED COHEN
                  I am sorry.

     JARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the
     eye. Then walks out.

     SARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the
     window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of
     fruit and cheese and pastries. She is not eating. She sits
     and stares. Eventually the door behind her opens, and a
     SECURITY GUY walks in with ERIC.

                            SECURITY GUY
                  They are almost ready for you Ms.
                  Robertson. Couple of minutes.

     SECURITY GUY leaves the room. ERIC looks over at SARAH then
     sits in the chair near her. Silence.

                  Thank you... Sam and the rest of your
                  floor are gone after today as well.

                            ERIC
                  Really... and Cohen?

                  No... still here.

                            ERIC
                  Of course...

     Long awkward pause. Eric looks around for something, anything
     to talk about.

                            ERIC (cont'd)
                  Are you still dating that tall guy...
                  from the Christmas thing?

     She looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit
     for trying to break the ice.

                               SARAH ROBERTSON
                  No.

                            ERIC
                  He was very tall.

               I did pass on your concerns last year...
               just so you know.

                         ERIC
               It doesn't matter.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON
               It does.

     The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a
     cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places
     it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is
     overwhelming.

                            SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)
               Thank you.

     The caterer leaves. ERIC looks around.

                          ERIC
               Have they taken all the phones out of
               this room?

     SARAH nods yes.

                         ERIC (cont'd)
               Jesus. Paranoid fucks.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               Yeah... I didn't think they were going to
               be able to get you back here.

     ERIC stands up and goes over to the window.

                         ERIC
               They told me they were going to drag me
               through hell on everything from my
               options to healthcare over the next two
               years or I come back and make...
                   (he looks up and does a little
                    math in his head)
               $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room
               quietly... it wasn't much of choice.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               It never is.

     ERIC goes back and sits in the chair.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd)
               Obviously looking back, the point was
               expressed with insufficient urgency...

               but your point was passed on... I need

                         ERIC
               OK.

                         ERIC
               I understand, there was nothing you could
               do.

     Now SARAH questions herself.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               I guess... at the time... it didn't seem
               like there was much of a choice.

                         ERIC
               It never does.

     They both look at each other with miniscule smiles, then out
     the windows onto the city, defeated. Long silence.

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               You have kids, yeah?

     Long pause as he lets her alone.

                         ERIC
               What is your package going to look like?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for
               now.

                         ERIC
               Should be pretty good, no?

                         SARAH ROBERTSON
               It better be.

     There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the
     conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly
     with one another. They are oblivious to what is about to
     happen. Eventually, SAM, WILL, JARED, and a firm lawyer, come
     into the room. Everyone quiets down a bit.

                  Alright, hey...(whistles).

     They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of the
     table. JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corner
     just to observe. SAM looks somber.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Thank you all for coming in a little
                  early this morning, I know yesterday was
                  pretty bad, I wish I could say that today
                  is going to be less so but that isn't
                  going to be the case. Now I am supposed
                  to read this statement here to you all
                  but how bout you read it on your own time
                  and I'll just tell you what the fuck's
                  going on here.

     THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he
     continues.

                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                  I have spent the night here meeting with
                  the executive committee and the decision
                  has been made to begin to unwind a
                  considerable portion of the firm's
                  holdings in several key asset classes.
                  The crux of it is... in the firm's
                  thinking the party is over as of this
                  morning. There is going to be
                  considerable turmoil in the markets for
                  the foreseeable future. They believe that
                  it is better to have this turmoil begin
                  with us... as a result the firm has
                  decided to liquidate the majority of its
                  position of fixed income MBS today.

     An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the
     traders in the room.

                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
                  You should be getting a breakdown right
                  now, you will see the accounts you are
                  responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't
                  taken you long to understand the
                  implications of this sale on your
                  relationships with your counterparties
                  and as a result on your careers. I have
                  expressed this reality to the executive
                  committee and they understand. As a
                  result, if you are able to complete a 93%
                  sale of your assets you will receive a
                  1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

               If the floor as a whole is able to
               achieve a 93% sale we all get an
               additional 1.3 million a piece. Because
               of this, if you burn through your
               allotment by noon, get moving around the
               floor and start picking up other guys
               leftovers...

     SAM stops for a second and looks around the room.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               For those of you who have never been
               through this before, this is what the
               beginning of a fire sale looks like. I
               don't have to tell any of you that the
               first hour and a half is going to be very
               important. I want you to hit every bite
               you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers,
               and your mother if she's buying...and
               obviously no swaps, its outgoing only
               today. This is obviously not the way any
               of us would like for this to be going
               down, but the ground is shifting below
               our feet, and there appears to be no
               other way out.

     SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees
     that they indeed know what needs to be done.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               Obviously... this is a very unique
               situation... if we are successful today
               we will have been successful in
               destroying our own jobs... I can not
               promise that each of you will be
               repositioned within the firm, but I can
               tell you that I am very proud of the work
               we have done together here, I have been
               at this here for 34 years, and I know...
               from experience people are going to say
               some nasty stuff about what we have done
               here, and what you have devoted a portion
               of your life to. But have faith that in
               the greater picture our skills have not
               been wasted, we have accomplished much,
               and our talents have served some greater
               good...

     He looks down at the ground, then back up around the room.
     Then he walks out.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

     There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then
     a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that
     the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He
     appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN
     walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into
     the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He
     looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he
     climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a
     general.

                         JOHN TULD
               By the end of today almost everyone else
               in the world, including me, will have
               considerably less money than they began
               the day with..... You, in this room, are
               the exception. You will leave here today
               richer. You will fire the first shot, I
               wish it didn't have to be, but at times
               the market must eat its weak, and you
               all... are not the weak. We must strike
               quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause
               on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is
               going to be in here getting in your
               faces, sniffing around, you let us take
               care of them and you just keep going. We
               own what we are choosing to sell today
               and there is nothing they can do about
               it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,
               today we secure our place for next 107.
               You've got two minutes before we get
               started. Let's finish this, so we can get
               on to the next one...

     JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing
     off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then
     heads into his office.

     He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes
     almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go
     wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares
     into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs
     begin to move. We just see the back of his head.

     Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the

     The market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers.
     There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we
     hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up
     and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway.

                            JARED COHEN
               Well done.

                         SAM ROGERS
               They did alright.

                         JARED COHEN
               I wanted to give you a heads up. They are
               going to start sending some people home
               out here.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Now?

                         JARED COHEN
               (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends.

                            SAM ROGERS
               Of course.

                         JARED COHEN
               For what it's worth, you're good... Guess
               somebody upstairs must really like you.

     SAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word.

     He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN
     BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes
     to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator.

     The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of
     floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city
     beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the
     last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but
     waves him down. SAM approaches.

                         JOHN TULD
               Sam, please sit. Congratulations are
               clearly in order.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Our guys did what they could.

                            JOHN TULD
                  You did a hell of a job today, and I
                  thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for
                  eating but it's been a long day. Can I
                  get you anything?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  No, no thanks.

     They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few
     more bites of his meal.

                            TULD
                  So what can I do for you?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I want out.

                               TULD
                  I'm sorry?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I'm done, I want out.

                            TULD
                  It's been a very difficult day, for
                  everyone.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I need you to release my options, that is
                  if they're still worth anything after
                  today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.

                            TULD
                  You'll get the bonus, the options, and
                  keep your current base, but I need you to
                  stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?

     They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually
     a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another
     hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.

                            TULD (cont'd)
                  For God's sake man put a smile on your
                  face, you did some good today, you said
                  so yourself. I'm starting to feel a
                  little better about this whole thing.
                  You're one of the luckiest guys in the
                  world, you could've been digging ditches
                  all these years...

     SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.



                                                             (CONTINUED)
                                                                 93.

                         SAM ROGERS
               That's true, and if I had been at least
               there'd be some holes in the ground to
               show for it. I'm just not quite sure how
               we fucked this thing up so badly.

     This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be
     losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.

                         TULD
               Jesus, when did you start feeling so
               sorry for yourself, it's unbearable...
               What, you think we may have helped put
               some people out of business today? That
               it's all just for naught? Well you've
               been doing that everyday for almost forty
               years Sam. And if all this is for naught
               then so is everything else out there.
               It's just money, it's made up, a piece of
               paper with some pictures on it so we
               don't all kill each other trying to get
               something to eat. But it's not wrong and
               it's certainly not any different today
               than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797,
               1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37,
               `73, and 1987... God damn did that
               motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97,
               2000, and whatever this is gonna be
               called. They're just the same thing over
               and over. We can't help ourselves, and
               you and I can't control it, stop it, slow
               it, or even ever so slightly alter it...
               We just react... and we get paid well for
               it if we're right... and get left by the
               side of the road if we're wrong. There's
               always been and there's always gonna be
               the same percentage of winners and
               losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat
               pigs and starving dogs in this world...
               yes there may be more of us today... but
               the percentages... they always stay
               exactly the same.

     They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks
     down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I'll do it John, but not because of your
               little speech, but because I need the
               money. I'm not sure how it could possibly
               be after all these years, but I need the
               money.

     They both look at each other again, then look over and see
     JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER
     SULLIVAN next to him.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               You're keeping the kid?

                         JOHN TULD
               Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's
               all hands on deck now Sam, there's going
               to be a lot of money to be made coming
               out of this mess, we're going to need all
               the brains we can get around here.

     They look at each other one last time then SAM starts walking
     away and as he passes PETER he just gives him a slight nod.

                                          VERY SLOW FADE TO BLACK:

                                                       OVER BLACK:

     We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.

     Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard
     digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.

     He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the
     house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the
     door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and
     slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY
     ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.

                         MARY ROGERS
               Hello! ... I've called the police.

     SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel
     handle.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Mary.

     She comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next
     to the hole.

                            MARY ROGERS (cont'd)
                  What are you doing?

                               SAM ROGERS
                  Ella died.

     MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.

                               MARY ROGERS
                  Oh God.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  Well I'm very sorry.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yeah... I really loved that dog

                            MARY ROGERS
                  I know, but Sam you don't live here
                  anymore.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I was driving home from the vet and this
                  is the only place I could think to bury
                  her. This is where she belongs...

     She looks at him deeply.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  Well. You should have called.

                               SAM ROGERS
                  I know.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  Are you alright? You look terrible.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Yeah. Tough day all around.

                            MARY ROGERS
                  I heard, Sammy called.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  Is he alright?

                         MARY ROGERS
               He said they got hammered, but got out
               alive.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Good, I was going to call him this
               morning... but...

                         MARY ROGERS
               Well, I am going to go back in to bed.
               The alarm is on so don't try to break in.
                   (Sam smiles)
               Well, you take care of yourself.

                         SAM ROGERS
               Is it alright if I finish up here?

                         MARY ROGERS
               Yes.

     MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off
     the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts
     humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming
     then kicks in with the full version.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

MARGOT AT THE WEDDING

1   INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY                                          1

    A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The
    boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard
    tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This
    is Claude.

    We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,
    balances it in one hand as he opens the door.

    The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.

    He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits
    while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above
    the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration
    alternating between the food and the path.

    He sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog.

                           CLAUDE
              Here.

    He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black
    circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly
    blushes and mumbles:

                           CLAUDE
              Sorry.

    He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next
    to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder
    length hair. Her name is Margot.

                        MARGOT
              That was quick.

                        CLAUDE
              I sat next to the wrong person.

                         MARGOT
              Really?   Where?
    She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her
    shirt.
                        CLAUDE
              Please don't look.    She'll see you.
                        MARGOT
              Careful with my blouse.

                                                             2.


2   CUT TO:                                                       2

    Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude
    listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,
    and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes
    between cars.

    The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops,
    looks around. He screams again.

3   CUT TO:                                                       3

    Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a
    river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.

    Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.
    Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger
    against the glass and traces the wires.

                        CLAUDE
              Will the wedding be crowded?

                        MARGOT
              I don't know. I think she doesn't
              know anyone anymore.

                        CLAUDE
              How long has she known Malcolm?

                        MARGOT
              Only a year.

                        CLAUDE
              Is that short?

                        MARGOT
                  (pointedly)
              Would you marry someone you'd only
              known a year?
                        CLAUDE
              I'm not going to ever get married.
                        MARGOT
              I can't say I have a lot of hope
              for the whole thing.
                        CLAUDE
              Why are we going then?

                        MARGOT
              We're supporting her.

                                                               3.


                        CLAUDE
              I thought she wasn't speaking to
              you.

                        MARGOT
              No...no...I wasn't speaking to her,
              but I'm over it.

4   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                           4

    A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs,
    clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun
    hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his
    shoulder.

5   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                5

    The rumbling and sputtering of the boat.    People get out of
    their cars and stretch their legs.

    Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his
    face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She
    stuffs the phone in her pocket.

                        MARGOT
              Why aren't you wearing your new
              shades?

                        CLAUDE
              I don't think I need them right
              now.

                        MARGOT
              You begged for those glasses.

                        CLAUDE
              I know, but...I will wear them, I
              just feel like people might think
              it's weird that a kid is wearing
              dark shades.
                        MARGOT
              That's ridiculous.
    Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk
    sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self-
    consciously.
                        MARGOT
              You look very cool.
    He takes them off.

                                                             4.


                        CLAUDE
              I don't need them right now.

6   CUT TO:                                                       6

    Margot and Claude wait.   The ferry has emptied out.

                        CLAUDE
              Do they know we're here?

    A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops
    across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the
    backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down
    the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and
    sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.

                        MALCOLM
              Are you...?

7   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                              7

    Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is
    in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,
    Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.
    Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a
    panda on it.

                        MALCOLM
              Paul apologizes for not coming,
              she's still getting the house
              ready.

                        MARGOT
              I'm sorry it was such short notice.

                        MALCOLM
              I don't care. Paul's frantic, but
              I don't give a shit. Oh, and
              Ingrid wants me to tell you that
              she made us all bracelets.
                        INGRID
                  (embarrassed)
              No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...
                        MALCOLM
              Oh, I thought you asked me to tell
              them. Anyway...

    Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange
    bracelet.

                                                           5.


                    MALCOLM
          I got Knicks colors.

                    INGRID
          They're not Knicks colors!

                    MARGOT
          It's beautiful, Ingrid.

                    INGRID
              (to Claude)
          I made this one for myself.

She shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.

                    INGRID
          Yours is yellow. Is that okay?

                          CLAUDE
          I guess.

                    INGRID
          Where's your dad and Josh?

                    CLAUDE
          They might come later.

                    MARGOT
          Josh's spring break is next week.
          Jim teaches through Friday and then
          they open the house in Vermont on
          the weekend.

                    MALCOLM
              (bluntly)
          It means a lot to Pauline that
          you're here.

Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.
                          MARGOT
          Oh.     Good.
A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near
their car. Malcolm swerves anyway.
                    MALCOLM
          Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!
Ingrid giggles.    Margot clutches the handle above the door.

                                                                 6.


                        MALCOLM
              If you're wondering about the
              moustache --

                        MARGOT
              No, I wasn't.

                        MALCOLM
              I had a full beard   for a while and
              then when I shaved   it I left this
              part for last, you   know to see how
              it looked, and...    It's meant to be
              funny.

    Margot nods politely.   The sound of tires on gravel:

8   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  8

    The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway
    alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water.
    They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.

    Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her
    sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot
    smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips
    down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.

                        PAULINE
              You're so handsome.

    Now she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.   Claude beams.

                        PAULINE
              I never thought I'd get you here.

    A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A
    large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped
    into their yard. There's whispering and movement through
    brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with
    concern.
                        PAULINE
              You're arriving in the midst of a
              drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is
              inside.
    Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.
                        INGRID
              It's the Voglers.

                                                                7.


                        PAULINE
              The neighbors want us to cut down
              our tree.

    She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the
    adjoining property.

                        MARGOT
              No, that's our tree!

                        INGRID
              They think it's sick and rotting
              their property.

                        PAULINE
              We're having the ceremony under it.

                        MARGOT
              You took the swing down.

                        MALCOLM
              Pauline thinks this is their way of
              trying to be friends. I think they
              resent us because we're...

    He searches for the word, but can't come up with anything.
    He says wearily:

                        MALCOLM
              I don't know what we are.

9   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM/INGRID'S ROOM - DAY                     9

    Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his
    wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door
    opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto
    another bedroom.

    Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a
    realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.
                        INGRID
              This is my room.
                         CLAUDE
              Okay.
                        INGRID
              Do you like showers or baths?

                         CLAUDE
              Showers.   What about you?

                                                                8.


     Ingrid shrugs.   She says, already bored with the topic:

                         INGRID
               I don't care.

10   INT. STAIRWELL/MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    10

     Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now
     wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one
     another.

                         PAULINE
               Is Malcolm what you thought he'd
               be?

                         MARGOT
               Well, I didn't know what to --

                         PAULINE
               The moustache is temporary. He
               left it for last when he was
               shaving. It's meant to be funny.

                         MARGOT
               He told me.

                          PAULINE
               Yeah...

     They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the
     curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.

                         PAULINE
               I'm sorry -- with so little time to
               prepare, we had to put you in
               Malcolm's storage room --

                         MARGOT
               This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky.
                         PAULINE
               Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a
               storage room. I've just started to
               feel like it's our house not my
               parents. You know?
                         MARGOT
               Our parents.

                         PAULINE
               Of course. It might still smell
               like paint, but...

                                                           9.


                     MARGOT
           I thought he was a musician.

Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to
unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.

                     PAULINE
           Well, music's officially a hobby...
           He's painting now. And writing
           letters to newspapers and
           magazines. He's very meticulous,
           he'll spend up to a week writing a
           response to a music review. He's
           incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
           I don't know. We're doing very
           well.

                       MARGOT
           Good.    I mean, you must be.

Silence.

                     PAULINE
           I don't know where to begin. What
           can I tell you? It seems I'm
           pregnant, but it's really early
           so... I haven't told anyone. I
           mean, I haven't told Malcolm or
           Ingrid.

                       MARGOT
           Wow...

                     PAULINE
           Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I
           hope so. Things are good. We did
           a couples seminar two months ago or
           so in Maine. They give you
           exercises and things to do. I know
           you're not convinced, but...
                     MARGOT
               (vaguely)
           Mm hm.
                     PAULINE
           We got engaged right afterwards.
           The guy who runs it, Strickland,
           wrote a really interesting book
           about loving which I'll lend you if
           you want.

                                                10.


                    MARGOT
              (non-committal)
          Okay.

                    PAULINE
          But only if you'll read it.
          Because I need it back. I made
          notes in the margins.

                    MARGOT
          I may not get to it for a while.

                    PAULINE
          Well, I'm not going to lend it to
          you if you're not going to read it.

They meet eyes.   Pauline quickly turns away.

                    PAULINE
          It's going to be very informal by
          the way. Just Mom and Becky.
          Malcolm's brother. Few friends.
          And now you and Claude. Nothing
          like the first one.

                     MARGOT
              (wary)
          Becky's coming?

                    PAULINE/MARGOT
          She isn't how you.../I'd really
          like...

                     PAULINE
          You go.

                    MARGOT
          I was going to say, "I'd really
          like some white wine."
                    PAULINE
          Oh. Yeah. We have a...
          Well...I'm glad you changed your
          mind and came. I never heard from
          you after I sent the invite...I
          even wondered if you got it.
                    MARGOT
              (quickly)
          Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
                    PAULINE
          Did you get it?

                                                               11.


                         MARGOT
               Yeah.

     Pauline waits for an explanation.

                         MARGOT
               I'm sorry you were so angry...

                         PAULINE
               I wasn't angry. I
               was...disappointed.

                         MARGOT
               Uh huh. But you see when you say,
               "disappointed" it puts me in a
               crummy situation. Like I let you
               down.

                         PAULINE
               But you did in a way.

                         MARGOT
               I don't see it like that.

                          PAULINE
               Fine. I felt betrayed.    Is that
               word okay?

                          MARGOT
               Again, you're making me the
               aggressor.

                          PAULINE
               You were the aggressor.
                   (pause)
               Let's not... I've become a really
               good cook.
11   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY                                 11
     Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his
     feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record
     sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little
     brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.

                         MARGOT
               I can't believe you've still got
               all of our old records.
     Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the
     scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and
     hands it to her mother.

                                                       12.


                    INGRID
          Mom, can you hide this please.

Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf.

                    PAULINE
              (for Margot's benefit)
          Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek
          once?

                    MALCOLM
          In the late `80's. It was a solo
          gig after he left the Cars.

                    CLAUDE
          So, you're kind of famous.

Malcolm reddens.

                    MALCOLM
          No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I
          used to want to be, but, No. Do
          you want to be famous?

                    MARGOT
          Claude wants to be very famous.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, make sure you can handle
          rejection. I can't. For me,
          expectation just turns to
          disappointment. So, ultimately I'd
          rather not try. It'll all go black
          for us soon enough anyway.

                    PAULINE
          Claude, ignore him.

Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with
an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows
uncomfortable. She says to Claude:

                    PAULINE
          When your mother moved to New York
          she used to send me books and
          records. She sent me REM's
          Murmur...
                    MARGOT
          And the Pixies.

                                                            13.


                   PAULINE
          And X. She was very cool your
          mother.

                    MARGOT
          You only liked top forty.

                    PAULINE
          Yeah, but I love REM now.

Margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes.

                    MARGOT
          I don't really listen to music
          anymore.

                    PAULINE
          I was dating that guy, Horace back
          then. Remember him?

                    MARGOT
          Was that the guy who liked to rough
          you up?

                    PAULINE
          No, that was our dad.

Pauline and Margot crack up laughing.   Malcolm raises an
eyebrow at Claude.

                    MARGOT
          Our father used to strip down to
          his skivvies and beat us with a
          belt.

                    MALCOLM
          That man had a sexual screw loose.

                    PAULINE
          It's awful -- that stuff that
          happens to kids. Malcolm was
          fondled by a male baby-sitter.
                    MALCOLM
          Just use that information however
          you want...
                     PAULINE
          Sorry. We're with family.     I
          figured...
Claude looks at Malcolm.   Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.

                                                              14.


                         PAULINE
               I think Becky got it the worst.

                          MARGOT
               Did she ever. Raped by the horse
               trainer...

     Margot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back
     into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream
     down Margot's face. Claude watches.

12   EXT. PATIO - NIGHT                                         12

     Malcolm, Pauline, Margot, Claude and Ingrid sit with a
     homosexual couple, Alan, 40's, and Toby, 30's, and their son,
     Bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup.
     Part of Alan's face is paralyzed.

                         TOBY
               Alan rolled over in bed and looked
               at me and he said I can't feel my
               face. It took three doctors before
               we knew it was Bells Palsy.

                         ALAN
               They say a brush of wind can do it.

                         TOBY
               Feeling is slowly coming back.

                         MALCOLM
               We're all getting older... Which
               is terrible -- I don't care how
               universal it is. I can't remember
               names anymore.

                         MARGOT
               I have that. I blank out on
               certain words now too. Like the
               other day, I couldn't remember the
               word for...
                   (laughs)
               I've forgotten it again. The stuff
               in wine. Sediment! That was it.

                         MALCOLM
               I know that. I was talking more
               about not remembering who was the
               bassist for Motley Crüe.
     Malcolm lights up a cigarette.   He offers one to Claude who
     shakes his head, No.

                                                            15.


                    PAULINE
          Ingrid, why don't you show Claude
          and Bruce the game trunk.

                    INGRID
          Okay.

Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce.      He looks back
longingly at the table of adults.

                     MALCOLM
              (relieved, to himself)
          Mick Mars.

                    MARGOT
          Toby, I think you need to have
          Bruce diagnosed.

                    TOBY
          Margot, I don't want to have this
          conversation with you.

We follow the kids inside.   We hear in the background:

                     MARGOT
          It's vital. If you keep telling
          him he's like everyone else he'll
          wonder why he isn't. He's
          suffering.

                     TOBY
          He's tested very well.    He does B's
          in school.

Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the
window. Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no
connection -- she goes back to Toby.

                    MARGOT
          But, that's how autism works. One
          part of the brain can work fine
          while the other is damaged.
                    ALAN
          We had him diagnosed, Margot.
          Nothing was found wrong.
                    MARGOT
          Did you really, though?
                    TOBY
          I'm...I'm not going to have this
          conversation. I'm sorry.

                                                              16.


     Silence.

                          MARGOT
                I know it must be so difficult for
                you, but I think you have to --

13   INT. KITCHEN - SAME                                          13

     Pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter.   She
     hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.

14   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           14

     Margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb
     garden. She drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a
     joint. The bottle lies at her feet, three-quarters empty.

                          JIM'S VOICE
                What are you doing?

                          MARGOT
                I left you a note.

                          JIM'S VOICE
                Come back. Or meet me in Vermont
                on Saturday.

                           MARGOT
                No...no. The wedding is on
                Saturday. I'm here for that. I
                can't really pull out. How would
                that look?

                          JIM'S VOICE
                You haven't spoken to her in years -
                -

                          MARGOT
                Well, we're speaking now. She is
                my closest friend despite it all...
                You're the one who's been trying to
                get me to call her.
                          JIM'S VOICE
                Did you tell Claude what you're
                doing?
                          MARGOT
                    (suddenly laughing)
                Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's
                exactly what you'd imagine except I
                think he's clinically depressed.
                          (MORE)

                                                                17.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Not ugly, but completely
               unattractive. And he has no job.
               The best I can make out is that
               he's a letter writer. I don't
               know, the house looks weird to
               me...she's trying too hard and it's
               kind of a mess...they took down the
               swing...

     Silence on the other end.

                            MARGOT
               Hello?

                         JIM'S VOICE
               You said you weren't a hundred
               percent on this. You said that
               like a week ago. Can I come up
               there?

                         MARGOT
               No. I don't want to see you -- I
               feel happier already having done
               it.

                         JIM'S VOICE
               Really? You feel happier...
                   (silence)
               Please don't tell Claude anything
               please, until we've talked more.

                         MARGOT
               I need to tell him. And we need to
               tell Josh. Did he do his homework?

                            JIM'S VOICE
               Yes.

                         MARGOT
               This is happening and you have to
               get your mind around that.
15   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                             15
     Claude sleeps in bed.    Margot gently touches his face.   She
     whispers:
                         MARGOT
               Are you asleep?

                            CLAUDE
                      (softly)
               Yes.

                                                       18.


                    MARGOT
          Will you remember this?

                       CLAUDE
          Yes.

                    MARGOT
          I just talked to your dad...

Claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.

                    MARGOT
          I'm only going to tell you if you
          won't remember.

                       CLAUDE
          Okay.

Margot hesitates.    She changes her mind and says
thoughtfully:

                     MARGOT
          Everyone finds you so funny and
          charming. I always get compliments
          about you.

Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and
smears some eye make-up off of her face.

                    MARGOT
          Are you having fun?    Is it nice to
          see Pauline?

                    CLAUDE
              (opens his eyes)
          Yeah, I really like her.

                       MARGOT
          Yeah.     She is crazy though.
                    CLAUDE
          In what way?
                    MARGOT
          She's really berserk. Maybe it's
          hormones. You don't notice
          anything different about Pauline?
                       CLAUDE
          No.

                                                             19.


                         MARGOT
               She's pregnant -- she told me. But
               she's keeping it a secret -- I mean
               from Malcolm and even Ingrid.
               Which I think is unforgiveable.
               Now she'll have to marry him.
               What's she planning -- to get
               married and not drink champagne?
               Then she'll just be lying. I guess
               she's afraid she'll miscarry. She
               probably will. I think on some
               level she's ambivalent about the
               marriage and that's why she's not
               telling him.

                         CLAUDE
               Are you stoned, Mom?

                         MARGOT
               Maybe a little.

                         CLAUDE
               I don't like it.

16   INT. MALCOLM AND PAULINE'S ROOM - NIGHT                     16

     Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of
     whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.

                         MALCOLM
                   (shakes his head)
               My scrotum is longer than my penis.

     He turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of
     the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open.

                         MALCOLM
               It's sweet how Claude looks up to
               me.
     He waits for a reaction and gets none.

                         MALCOLM
               Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you
               made her out to be.
                         PAULINE
               What she did to Toby and Alan
               tonight didn't seem crazy enough
               for you?
                         MALCOLM
               I guess that seemed pretty crazy.

                                                        20.


                    PAULINE
              (immediately defensive)
          Well, she cares deeply.

                    MALCOLM
          Yeah, she's really worried about
          Bruce.

                    PAULINE
          This has nothing to do with Bruce.
          She thinks everyone is autistic.

Malcolm is about to speak, but instead he halts, paralyzed.

                    PAULINE
          What?

                    MALCOLM
          Nothing, you keep changing your
          position -- I'm just trying to
          figure out if I should agree with
          you or not?

                    PAULINE
          Well, can't she be both, care
          deeply and be crazy? Do people
          have to be all one thing?

                    MALCOLM
          I guess not.

                     PAULINE
          Well, okay...
              (back into it)
          It is nice she came for the
          wedding. She's so pretty, don't
          you think?

                    MALCOLM
              (warily)
          She's attractive.

                    PAULINE
          A little thin maybe...   But it is
          nice she came.
                    MALCOLM
          Let's fuck.

                                                                  21.


17   INT. MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - SAME                                17

     Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries
     to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and
     gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.

18   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                               18

     A croquet game in progress. Pauline and Malcolm play Margot
     and Claude. Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself.
     The dog next to her. Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully
     lines up his shot. Finally, he swings --

     The ball misses the wicket.    He shakes with frustration.

                          MALCOLM
               Fuck it!

     Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the
     neighbor's yard: A naked man, 40's, crouches. Arms extend
     from below and pull him downward. His ass pokes up over the
     weeds.

                         MARGOT
               Honey, you're up.

     Claude shakes out of his reverie. He walks briskly up to his
     ball and smacks it. It bullets forward and lands just short
     of Pauline's ball.

                         MARGOT
               Claude, don't just whack it.    Think
               about it before you hit.

                          CLAUDE
               Sorry.

     Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball
     down with her foot and prepares to swing.
                         MALCOLM
               Paul, what are you doing?
                         PAULINE
               I'm sending Claude's ball into the
               bushes.
                         MALCOLM
               Take the extra hit.

                         PAULINE
               I don't want to do that.

                                                         22.


                    MALCOLM
          It's the smarter play.

She whacks -- Claude's ball travels about two feet.

                       PAULINE
          Shit.

                    MALCOLM
          Pauline! See, I knew you
          couldn't... Your feet are too
          small!

Margot steps up to take her turn.   She regards the house.

                    MARGOT
          You took the awnings down.

Claude looks back into the adjacent yard: Flashes of skin. A
breast. Pubic hair. Claude crouches to see more clearly --
the bodies disappear from sight.

Malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes.
He swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a
ridge and onto the cement drive. It quickly sails down into
the road and bounces into a ditch.

Malcolm shakes furiously. He lifts his mallet, turns toward
the house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over the
incline and down to the water. Pauline puts her hands on her
hips.

                       PAULINE
          Well done.

                       MALCOLM
          Fuck you.

Malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach.
Claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.

                    MARGOT
          Honey, you're up.
He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double
wickets.
                    MARGOT
          You're going the wrong way.
                       CLAUDE
          Oh.

                                                                23.


     He blushes and laughs.    Pauline laughs.   Margot shakes her
     head.

                            MARGOT
               So stupid.

                         CLAUDE
               Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

     Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house.

                         CLAUDE
               We're in the middle of it.

                         MARGOT
               This is why I hate games.    I hate
               what it does to me.

     Pauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at
     her. Malcolm calls from the stairs:

                         MALCOLM (O.S.)
               Wait, we're not finished!

19   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                                19

     The five eat a salad nicoise lunch.

                         MARGOT
               Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline
               sometimes can't make eye-contact.
               How her gaze hovers just above your
               head.

                         MALCOLM
               Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.

                         MARGOT
               I always think I have something in
               my hair. It's not necessarily bad,
               Paul. It's just something you do.

     Pauline looks mildly horrified.   She suddenly turns to
     Claude.
                         PAULINE
               Claude have you ever seen your
               mother climb a tree?

                            CLAUDE
               No.

                                                                24.


                          MARGOT
               We don't have much opportunity in
               Manhattan.

                         PAULINE
               As kids Margot climbed everything.
               She could even climb that tree.

     She points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into
     the neighbor's property.

                         CLAUDE
               Can you do it, mom?

                         MARGOT
               Maybe later.

                          CLAUDE
               No, now.

                         INGRID
               Do it now, Margot!

                         PAULINE
               Show him, Margot.

20   CUT TO:                                                       20

     Margot strides toward the tree.   The group follows behind.

     She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself.

     Claude grins, impressed.

     With brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree.

     Claude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from
     below.

                         PAULINE
               I told you.
     Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the
     gang. They wave. She waves back.
     The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep
     breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The
     neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance,
     toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.

     An earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for
     a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more
     rapid.

                                                                25.


     A bug buzzes around her head.   She swats at it.

     Her family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a
     baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the
     table.

                         MARGOT
                   (under her breath)
               Shit.

     She wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked.    The
     buzzing continues.

     Close on Margot's ear. A small black gnat lands on the lip
     of the lobe. It hesitates and darts inside the hole.

     Margot gasps.   She jams her pinky in her ear.

     Pauline comes back out with an ice tea.

                         CLAUDE
               What's she doing now?

                         PAULINE
                   (dryly)
               She's stuck.

21   CUT TO:                                                      21

     A young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of
     the tree and toward Margot. He reaches out his hand to her.

                         MARGOT
                   (annoyed)
               I got it.

     She slowly lowers herself.

22   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       22
     Pauline is laughing, recounting the story. Claude and Ingrid
     laugh too. Margot shakes her head, embarrassed and furious.
                         CLAUDE
               You were great on the way up.
                         MARGOT
               Don't patronize me, Claude.
     Margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it.
                         PAULINE
               We're all laughing, Margot.

                                                               26.


                           MARGOT
                You're laughing in a kind way.
                Claude is taking too much pleasure
                out of it.

                            CLAUDE
                I am not.

                           MARGOT
                You are. You like to make fun of
                me. To see me get embarrassed.
                It's mean.

     Silence.   Margot puts her pinky back in her ear.   She frowns.

                          PAULINE
                What are you doing?

                          MARGOT
                I've got a fucking bug in my ear,
                okay?

23   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           23

     Pauline and Margot hike along a dirt trail. Claude and
     Ingrid idle behind, carrying walking sticks.

                           PAULINE
                I thought Claude could hand out
                programs. Ingrid's going to sing.
                Do you want to read a poem or
                something?

                          MARGOT
                You know I can't speak in front of
                people. I'm doing this
                "conversation" at the bookstore in
                town on Friday and I totally regret
                having said I'd do it.
                          PAULINE
                You're doing a "conversation?"
                          MARGOT
                Yeah, talking about my work in
                front of a crowd. I didn't invite
                you because...I thought it'd be
                boring.

                            PAULINE
                Uh huh.

                                                        27.


                      MARGOT
          What?    Say it.

                     PAULINE
          It's nothing. It's just...I would
          come...I want to come. I get a
          kick out of it. It's just weird,
          you know... So, you're not here
          for...
               (she stops herself)
          Okay, I get it. When did they ask
          you?

                    MARGOT
          A while ago. I'd said, No, but
          then when I was coming here anyway
          and...I guess it helps sales
          and...so...so.

                      PAULINE
          I see.

We catch a quick glimpse of people walking ahead in the path.

                    PAULINE
          Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes
          tied.

                    MARGOT
          Why? Is she seeing someone?   She's
          still obese, I assume.

                    PAULINE
          I think it's symbolic.

                     MARGOT
          I bet mom paid for it.   We should
          audit mom.

                    PAULINE
          I considered it in my twenties.
          You know, when I was fucking
          everyone. You remember.
                    MARGOT
          I did my share.
                    PAULINE
          But not like me.

                    MARGOT
          You want to count?

                                                         28.


                    PAULINE
          No, Margot, I don't want to count.
              (pause)
          What was it about Dad that had us
          fucking so many guys?

                    MARGOT
          I think it was the only time we
          could really feel unselfconscious
          and get out of our heads.

                    PAULINE
              (dismissive)
          I don't think that's it. I just
          think it was something we were good
          at.

Behind, Ingrid smacks her walking stick into Claude's.

                    INGRID
          Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.

                    CLAUDE
          No, she said she had Aspergers.

                    INGRID
          I thought that's what that means.

                    CLAUDE
          No, it's like lesser retarded.

                    INGRID
          I have adult ADD.

                    CLAUDE
          You mean child ADD.

                    INGRID
          No, for some reason I have the
          adult one. Maybe I'm retarded.
Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year
old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt
and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little
girl whines and lags behind.
Margot and Pauline slow down.   Claude and Ingrid catch up.
                     MAN
          Come on!
                    LITTLE GIRL
          I don't want to!

                                                        29.


                     MAN
          Come on!

                    LITTLE GIRL
          I don't want --

The woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her.
The girl screams.

                     MARGOT
          Hey!

The man and woman turn around sharply.

                    MARGOT
          Be careful!

                     WOMAN
          What?

                    MARGOT
          Be careful the way you pull on that
          child's arm. You'll take it out of
          its socket.

                    MAN
          Don't tell us how to treat our
          child.

                    MARGOT
          I don't care how you treat your
          child as long as you don't hurt
          him.

                    PAULINE
              (under her breath)
          It's a girl.

                    WOMAN
          She threw a rock at me.
                    MARGOT
          She's a little girl!
                    WOMAN
          She knew what she was doing.
She starts suddenly toward Margot.
                    WOMAN
          There is no hitting in our family.
          Do you understand?

                                                                   30.


     Margot backs up quickly.    The woman stops about ten feet
     away.

                         WOMAN
               Stay out of it, bitch.

     The woman turns back around. She lifts the girl into her
     arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight.

                         INGRID
               That was the Voglers.

                         PAULINE
               Jesus, Margot, what are you doing.
               They already hate us.

                         MARGOT
                   (wiping her eyes)
               Don't tell me what I can and can't
               do. That's child abuse.

                         CLAUDE
               Mom, she was psychotic.

                         MARGOT
               Stop picking on me.    Everyone.

24   CUT TO:                                                         24

     The four of them emerge into a clearing.     Nobody speaks.    A
     child's pink sneaker lies in the path.

                         MARGOT
               Oh God.

     Pauline walks over to it.    She crouches.

                         PAULINE
               It could be anyone's.
     Margot bursts into tears.    Pauline hesitates then holds her.

                         INGRID
               What are they going to do to us?
                         PAULINE
               They're not going to do anything,
               honey.

25   EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY                                          25
     Malcolm looks at Pauline. He's in the midst of writing a
     letter on a legal pad. Pauline is worked up.

                                                         31.


                    PAULINE
          We have to cut down that tree.

                    MALCOLM
          Where are we going to get married
          then?

                    PAULINE
          I don't...we'll do it in the
          fucking drive-way if we have to.

Claude and Ingrid listen from just inside the house.   Ingrid
looks at Claude nervously.

                    INGRID
          Your mom started a war. We have to
          make sure we wear shoes because
          they might start throwing glass.

                    CLAUDE
          Has that happened before?

                    INGRID
          I can't remember. I think so. No,
          it definitely has. Now I remember.

Behind them, Margot, made-up and wearing a dress, clomps down
the stairs, across the carpet and onto the porch.

                    PAULINE
          Where are you going?

                    MARGOT
              (tersely)
          To town. I'll be back for dinner.

                    PAULINE
          Come on, nobody blames you, Margot.

An old orange BMW idles at the end of the driveway. Pauline,
Malcolm, Claude and Ingrid watch Margot cross the drive-way.
A man, 50's, opens the passenger door. He smokes a brown
cigarette. Margot gets in. The man waves at the group on
the patio. Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid and Claude wave back.
                    CLAUDE
          Is that Dick Koosman?
                     PAULINE
          Yeah.   He has a house up here.

                                                              32.


                         CLAUDE
               What's he doing with mom?

                         PAULINE
               Good question.

26   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              26

     Ingrid sits at the roots of the tree, squeezing honey out of
     a honey bear onto her hand -- she watches the ants come.
     Claude sits on a low branch and looks over the fence:

                         INGRID
               How much do your parents make in a
               year?

                         CLAUDE
               I think about a hundred.    They bank
               at Chase.

     The front door of the Vogler's opens and a boy, 14, pees from
     the entrance-way into the plants in the yard.

                         INGRID
               Are they rich?

                          CLAUDE
               No.   They're middle class.

     The boy finishes and violently hurls a toy car at the fence.

                         BOY
               Just let me live!

     The toy lands a few feet short.   He goes inside and closes
     the door.

                         INGRID
               Upper or lower?
                         CLAUDE
               I think just middle.
     Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the
     Vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail. He stumbles,
     recovers and flings the animal at the front door.   He races
     back toward his property.
27   EXT. PORCH - EVENING                                          27

     Margot and Malcolm have cocktails. Pauline drinks a bottled
     water. Ingrid has cray pas, markers and paper and draws at a
     table. She draws a mole.

                                                           33.

Claude draws a boy with a big claw for a hand and CLAWED
under it. Wizard, the dog, lies at his feet.

                    MARGOT
          Dick and his daughter asked us over
          to swim tomorrow.

                    PAULINE
          We didn't invite them to the
          wedding.

                    MARGOT
          You're not really friends.

                    PAULINE
          We're friends enough that's it's
          awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us
          all the time.

                    MARGOT
          He's doing the interview with me in
          town on Friday. Did I tell you, he
          and I are collaborating on a
          screenplay, an adaptation of one of
          Dick's novels.

                    PAULINE
          No, I didn't even know you knew he
          was up here.

Malcolm takes one of Ingrid's markers and doodles.

                    MALCOLM
          Is he even a good writer?    Why do
          people care about him?

                    PAULINE
          You're competitive with everyone.
          It doesn't matter if they even do
          the same thing as you.
              (to Claude)
          He's competitive with Bono.

                    MALCOLM
          It's true. I don't subscribe to
          the credo that there's enough room
          for everyone to be successful. I
          think there are only a few spots
          available and people like Dick
          Koosman and Bono are taking them
          up.

Pauline looks at Malcolm's drawing.    It's a graphic image of
a man fucking a woman in the ass.

                                                                34.


                          PAULINE
               Malcolm, what would ever make you
               think that's something to draw
               right now?

     Claude and Ingrid stare at it.    Malcolm balls it up.

                         MALCOLM
               Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it.
               Sorry, Margot.

28   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                               28

     The car pulls into a driveway.    A modern house.   Dick and
     Maisy come out to greet them.

                         DICK
               You found it!

     Margot, the kids and Pauline get out. We stay in the car
     with Malcolm. Pauline comes to his window.

                            PAULINE
               What's up?

                         MALCOLM
               I don't want to do this...

                         PAULINE
               Come on, don't be that way.

     Maisy sits on the hood of the car and Ingrid introduces her
     to Claude. Dick approaches Margot -- she turns back to
     Pauline.

                         MALCOLM
               I'm not being that way -- I just
               don't feel like it. I'm going to
               go back and... I have work to do.
                         PAULINE
               Dick doesn't care that you don't
               make any money.
                         MALCOLM
               Is that why you think... That's
               not why I'm...I just hate swimming.
               I really hate it. It's disgusting
               to me. My mistake was saying I'd
               do it to begin with. You have fun.
                         PAULINE
               Fine, we'll have fun.

                                                                35.


     Malcolm's gaze goes to Maisy's breasts.    Margot watches him
     watch her.

                         MALCOLM
               People always pee in the pool.

                         PAULINE
               I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in
               their pool.

                         MALCOLM
               I'll bet you 500 dollars there's
               pee in that pool.

29   EXT. DICK'S POOL - DAY                                       29

     Pauline and Margot float beneath Claude who stands above
     them.

                         PAULINE
               To the end and back.   Claude, you
               say Go.

                         CLAUDE
               Okay.

     Margot knocks on the side of her head with her hand.

                         CLAUDE
               Go!

     Pauline flings herself in and is off. Margot hesitates then
     follows. Maisy and Dick watch from the chairs. Ingrid
     floats on a raft and cheers. Claude runs along the pool-
     side.

                         DICK
               How's your dad?

                         CLAUDE
               Good.
                         DICK
               He and I shared a thesis advisor at
               Stanford. Did you know that?
                         CLAUDE
               No.
     Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around.
     Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and
     neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.

                                                               36.


                     DICK
           I was dating your mom back then,
           did you know that?

                      CLAUDE
           No.

Pauline lands -- touches the wall first.    Margot a close
second.

                     CLAUDE
           Pauline wins!

Pauline beams. Margot immediately drifts to the ladder.
She's panting heavily.

                     CLAUDE
           Mom cheated. You didn't touch the
           wall!

                     MARGOT
           I did so. It doesn't matter.     I
           lost anyway.

                     PAULINE
           It was close.

Pauline floats on her back, exhausted.

Ingrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up
from beneath the surface.

Margot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel.
For a moment it's an embrace. Margot looks quickly over at
Claude --

His foot slips.

He topples in.
Water roars around him.

He opens his mouth.   Bubbles spurt out.
He drifts down.
Lying next to the drain is a field mouse.       Its eyes are
white.

Splash.   Hands wrap around him.
He goes up.

                                                                37.


     The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer.

     Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the
     ladder. She helps him climb out. Ingrid and Maisy are
     grinning. Their expressions slowly shift as they see
     Claude's face.

     Claude is sobbing.

                            PAULINE
               It's okay.

     Margot immediately wrenches Claude from Pauline's grasp.    She
     looks shocked and angry.

                            MARGOT
               I got him.

     She leads her son behind the bushes out of everyone's sight.

                         MARGOT
               It's okay, my baby.

     She gently lets him down. His sneakers squeak and slosh.
     Claude, soaking wet and ashamed, looks at his mother. She
     breaks into laughter. Claude wipes the water and tears from
     his eyes.

                         CLAUDE
               I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.

                         MARGOT
               Now we're even.

30   INT. PAULINE AND MALCOLM'S DEN - DAY                         30

     Margot, reclining on the couch, drinks a white wine with ice
     cubes. Pauline passes the doorway and stops. She holds tear-
     sheets of flowers and wedding decorations from various
     magazines.
                         PAULINE
               Here you are.
                         MARGOT
               You've got a problem.
                         PAULINE
               What do you mean?

                         MARGOT
               I don't like the girl and I don't
               like the way Malcolm looks at her.

                                                       38.


                    PAULINE
          Oh, come on, it's sexy.

                    MARGOT
          You didn't see it. I saw it.
          You've got a problem.

                    PAULINE
          I'm not worried.
              (pause)
          We could teach Claude how to swim.

                    MARGOT
          He won't want to do it.   It's too
          late.

Pauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple
steps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass.
Margot passes it to her. Pauline sips.

                    MARGOT
          Are you supposed to be doing that?

                     PAULINE
          No.

She hands it back.

                    PAULINE
          I liked your last story in, was it
          Harpers? The one about mom. I was
          very...I liked it very much.

                    MARGOT
          It wasn't really about mom.

                    PAULINE
          I thought it was. Anyway. Why
          don't you want Claude to know how
          to swim?
                    MARGOT
          I didn't say I didn't want him to.
          Why do you care? It's not in his
          life -- we're New Yorkers. If he
          wants to learn when he's older, he
          can. I'm curious why you're so
          interested in the whole thing.
                    PAULINE
          I'm not. I'm just... As a safety
          thing and...I'm... Forget it.
              (pause)
                    (MORE)

                                                             39.

                         PAULINE (CONT'D)
               It's interesting -- this is the
               first time Dick has invited us
               over.

                         MARGOT
               But are you really friends?

                         PAULINE
               Kind of. We're neighbors. We
               employ Maisy. I mean I don't care,
               I just think it's interesting.
                   (pause)
               Are you excited about the talk? I
               thought I'd come if that's okay.
               My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's
               it like to have a celebrity as a
               sister?" I said, I've got no
               problem with celebrity. Alice
               Munro taught at Bennington and was
               kind of a friend of mine.

                         MARGOT
               I'm not a celebrity.

                         PAULINE
               Well, you're well known.

                         MARGOT
               To a very few people.

                         PAULINE
               Just accept the compliment.

                         MARGOT
               I guess I didn't realize it was a
               compliment.

31   EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY                                     31

     Margot walks the path alone. She hugs herself as a light
     breeze kicks up. Her footsteps echo in the trees.
     The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt.
     She crouches down and takes it.
32   CUT TO:                                                    32
     CLOSE: A note is being written.

     "...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your
     child I will call the police."

                                                               40.


     The word "any" is then underlined twice.   The page is torn
     from her little brown book.

33   EXT. VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING                                   33

     Margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door.
     She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and
     holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around
     to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window:

     It's a white tiled bathroom.

     A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced
     on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass
     is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs.

     Mrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the
     water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs
     against him.

     Margot chews her cuticle.

     The man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth,
     straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his
     temples.

     Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the
     window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces
     the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the
     floor.

     Margot moves to another window.   The pig's face now looks at
     her.

     Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The
     woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid.

     Suddenly a face appears in the glass. Margot leaps back.
     It's a thin boy. He says something. The family turns to the
     window. The father flicks off the bathroom light.
     From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition.
     Margot scampers into the trees.   She pushes through branches,
     her shirt tears. She runs.
34   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - EVENING                            34
     Claude sits on the bed. The record sleeve from Blondie's
     "Parallel Lines" rests in his lap. He reads the lyrics to
     the song, "Sunday Girl." He depresses the red record button
     on an old portable tape recorder. He sings a cappella and
     full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can.

                                                              41.


     Maisy appears in the doorway and watches.   Claude turns mid-
     lyric. He jumps, startled.

                            MAISY
               Singing?

     Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.

                            CLAUDE
               Hm?     A bit.

     She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who
     remains on the bed.

     Margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape.
     She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's
     hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth
     stomach.

                         MAISY
               Can I make a suggestion?

                            CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

                         MAISY
               You should get underarm deodorant.

                            CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

                         MAISY
               You kind of smell.

     Claude blushes.

                         MAISY
               Better I tell you than someone
               else.
35   INT. MARGOT'S BATHROOM - EVENING                           35

     Margot puts on mascara and watches Claude, who stands behind
     her, in the mirror.
                         MARGOT
               I think you smell nice.    You smell
               real.

                            CLAUDE
               I stink.

                                     42.


          MARGOT
It causes cancer.

          CLAUDE
Underarm deodorant?

          MARGOT
Yes. It's got chemicals and things
that are extremely harmful.

          CLAUDE
I'm not going to die from underarm
cancer.

           MARGOT
No, you'll get it somewhere else.
Like your stomach or your
testicles.

           CLAUDE
    (laughs)
Testicles.

          MARGOT
Don't laugh, that's a serious
thing.
Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?

          CLAUDE
Yeah.

          MARGOT
I hope you're not interested in
that girl. I find her
insufferable.

          CLAUDE
What does that mean?

          MARGOT
It means I can't suffer her. She's
loud and stupid. She goes on about
things of which she knows nothing
about.
          CLAUDE
She got into Harvard early.
          MARGOT
Stupid people get into Harvard
early all the time.

                                                             43.


                         CLAUDE
               Where did you go again?

                         MARGOT
               Barnard.
                   (pause)
               I just don't think you should do
               anything with her.

                         CLAUDE
                   (embarrassed)
               We're just friends.

                         MARGOT
               If you do, use a condom.

     Claude looks into the toilet. A square of toilet paper with
     a red lip outline floats on top of the water.

                         CLAUDE
               Where are you going?

                         MARGOT
               Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.

                         CLAUDE
               Are kids coming?

36   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  36

     Claude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back
     seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The
     ignition turns.

     Claude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away.
     Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of
     them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a
     stalk of celery.

                         INGRID
               Who do we know who's gay?
                         MAISY
               How do I know what gay people you
               know.
                         CLAUDE
               Alan and Toby.
                            INGRID
               And Bruce.     He's gay and Aspergers.

                                                      44.


                    CLAUDE
          I don't know if Bruce is gay.

                    INGRID
          He might be, it's very common.

                    CLAUDE
          Your mom is pregnant.

                    INGRID
          No she isn't.

                       CLAUDE
          She is.

Ingrid looks stricken.

                    MAISY
          How do you know that, Claude?

                    CLAUDE
          She told my mom. But you can tell -
          - she's hormonally weird.

                    MAISY
          Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to
          have a baby sister or brother.

                    INGRID
              (quietly)
          My mom thinks your mom is
          unreliable.

                       CLAUDE
          Who cares.

But he does. Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on
the crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude:

                    MAISY
          Do you think your mom is fuckable?
                    CLAUDE
          I don't know.
                    MAISY
          I think she's hot, your mother.
          I'd do her if I was gay. I might
          anyway. I mean if she came on to
          me.
                       CLAUDE
          She won't.

                                                               45.


                         INGRID
               I'm not going to do anyone.

     There's a scraping sound on the window.   The kids turn
     quickly:

                         CLAUDE
               What was that?

                         INGRID
               Is it scary?

37   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                                          37

     The three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats
     in the fence: The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table. A
     pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. Mrs. Vogler says
     something and the kids and Mr. Vogler laugh.

     Maisy climbs over Claude to see better. He feels her breasts
     press against his back. Suddenly he swats crazily at his
     ear. Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.

38   INT. VOLVO - NIGHT                                          38

     Malcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him. He's
     smoking with the window open, Dick and Margot in the
     backseat.

                         PAULINE
               Margot used to never speak. I
               remember when we went on a double
               date in high school, that kid Ron
               asked you if English was your first
               language.

                         MARGOT
               It's true. I used to think I might
               have some kind of brain defect.
                         PAULINE
               You thought you were aphasic.
                         MARGOT
               I'm still not sure.
                         PAULINE
               Oh, Jesus, Margot.
                         MARGOT
               It's very possible, Paul.

                                                        46.


                    PAULINE
          I just...your diagnoses sometimes
          irk the hell out of me.

Malcolm lights another cigarette -- the car jerks sideways.

                    MARGOT
          Malcolm, can you slow down.

                    MALCOLM
          What?

                    DICK
          I can drive if you like.

                    MALCOLM
          No, you got dinner, the driving's
          on me.

                    DICK
          Well, I'll let you pay your half if
          you'll slow down.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, neither Pauline or I ordered
          dessert.

                    PAULINE
          Malcolm, let it go.
              (taunting)
          Margot would insist on driving if
          she knew how.

                     MARGOT
               (to Dick)
          My license elapsed.   But I know
          how.

                    MALCOLM
          It's probably for the best. I have
          this theory, I think, historically,
          women have been held back in so
          many ways that when they get power,
          like they do behind the wheel, they
          can't help but abuse it. It's akin
          to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory
          about prison guards and prisoners
          switching rolls.
                    DICK
          That's a charming philosophy.

                                                           47.


                     MARGOT
          Yeah.   Tell that one a lot.

                    MALCOLM
          This isn't a blanket thing. I
          mean, women can be great drivers
          too...

He takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette.

                    PAULINE
          Said the man with the moustache
          that he thinks he's wearing in
          quotes.

                    MARGOT
          It's meant to be funny.

                    MALCOLM
              (to Pauline, re: Margot)
          Are you doing this for her benefit
          or mine?

Malcolm pumps the brake.

                    MALCOLM
          What the fuck?

                      PAULINE
          What?

                    MALCOLM
              (momentarily sober)
          No, there they go. Okay. It's
          fine. I thought I had no brakes
          for a minute...

Malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window -- it flies
through Margot's window and lands on her lap.
                      MARGOT
          Malcolm!
Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
                    MALCOLM
              (turning around)
          What?!

The car swerves again -- everyone jumps.
                      MARGOT
          Watch it!

                                                              48.


                         MALCOLM
               It's fine, Margot!

                         PAULINE
                   (to Malcolm)
               You're just so incompetent.

                         MALCOLM
                   (exploding)
               Why don't you fucking drive
               yourselves home!

     Malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder.   They
     jolt to a stop.

                         PAULINE
                   (quietly furious)
               Oh, God.

     Pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush. She
     leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit. Malcolm
     watches in the rearview mirror.

                         MARGOT
               You should go after her.

     Malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car. Margot and
     Dick watch out the back window. Pauline sees Malcolm coming
     and bolts into the woods. Malcolm charges after her.

                         DICK
               Come back with me tonight.

                         MARGOT
               I've got Claude.

                         DICK
               Come on, I've been trying to get
               you up here all year.
                         MARGOT
                   (vaguely)
               She's pregnant.
     Dick leans over to Margot's neck.    He licks her.
39   INT. INGRID'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   39
     Claude lies in bed with Ingrid. He chews off a piece of his
     pinky fingernail. He hesitates and places it on an end-
     table.

                                                       49.


                    INGRID
          Why are you putting that there?

                    CLAUDE
          I just want to keep it.

                    INGRID
          I left a piece of skin in a movie
          theater once so it could watch
          movies all its life.

                    CLAUDE
          I don't know if it's the same
          thing.

                    INGRID
          Are you obsessed with Maisy?

                     CLAUDE
          No.

                    INGRID
          You're always staring at her tits.

Ingrid traces Claude's upper lip with her finger.

                    INGRID
          You have a moustache.

                    CLAUDE
          My mom bleaches it.

                    INGRID
          I'm going to kiss your cheek and
          then you kiss mine.

                    CLAUDE
          I don't want to do that.

                     INGRID
          Why not?
                    CLAUDE
          Because it's pointless...
Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door
and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and
dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into
the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water
groans through the old pipes.

                                                              50.


                         INGRID
               Where are you going? I thought we
               were having a conversation.

                         CLAUDE
               You're starting to annoy me.

40   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                    40

     Claude walks -- he passes an open door: Malcolm is shaving
     his moustache -- the electric razor whirring.

41   INT. MARGOT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              41

     Claude enters.   It's empty. Her brown notebook rests on the
     bedside table.   He hesitates then opens it:

     It's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive
     in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page.

     Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles
     against the pillow and squints to read the writing.

                         MARGOT (O.S.)
               What are you doing?

     Claude startles.   Margot stands in the doorway with a glass
     of water.

                         CLAUDE
               I didn't think you came home.

                         MARGOT
               Where would I be?

                         CLAUDE
               Can't Josh and Dad come to the
               wedding?

                         MARGOT
               We've been through this.    Go to
               bed.
     Claude slides down to the floor.    He hesitates.
                         CLAUDE
               Can I sleep in here?
                            MARGOT
               No, honey.
                         CLAUDE
               We can put a pillow between us.

                                                              51.


                          MARGOT
               Okay.   Just for tonight.

     Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in
     the bed. We stay on him as he waits. Finally Margot climbs
     into the covers in a nightgown.

                         MARGOT
               When you were a baby I wouldn't let
               anyone else hold you. I think that
               may have been a mistake.

42   EXT. HOUSE - MORNING                                       42

     Malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his
     mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white
     tent. A workman holds a pole steadily.

     Pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. Ingrid
     idles a few feet away. They're in the midst of talking:

                         INGRID
               Why was it a secret?

                         PAULINE
               Because I didn't want to get you
               excited before it was real. It's
               not really a baby yet. In two more
               weeks we can celebrate together,
               okay?

                         INGRID
               Why did you tell Margot?

                         PAULINE
               Because she's my sister and I trust
               her. How do you feel about it?

                         INGRID
               I don't want a sister.
     Pauline touches Ingrid's hair gently.
                         INGRID
               I'm going to go get Wizard.
     She runs toward the house.   Pauline marches toward Malcolm.
                         PAULINE
               Margot told Claude something I
               expressly told her in confidence.
               And he told Ingrid.
                         (MORE)

                                                   52.

                    PAULINE (CONT'D)
          I'm stunned that she put me in this
          position. It's so fucking
          infuriating.

                    MALCOLM
          Well it's that thing where--

                    PAULINE
          Don't say anything. You know
          what...just be there for me.
          Silently.

                    MALCOLM
          Okay.

                    PAULINE
          Why do I have to be so careful
          around her, but everyone is allowed
          to make fun of me?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't know if --

                     PAULINE
          Malcolm, what did I just say?
              (sighs)
          You know, I just want you to take
          my side, I don't need you to make
          it better.

Malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder.

                    PAULINE
          Ingrid's really upset about it.
          Fuck. I can't believe she did this
          to me!
              (pause)
          I didn't tell you because... I
          didn't want you to feel like you
          had to marry me. I found out right
          before our seminar... I'm
          pregnant.
                    MALCOLM
          Uh huh.
                    PAULINE
          Well...does that sound good to you?
                    MALCOLM
          I'm still digesting Margot telling
          Claude. What a fucking nut job.
              (quickly)
          Sorry. I think I'm really happy.

                                                              53.


     Ingrid is watching from across the field.

                         PAULINE
               Come here, honey!

     Ingrid hurries through the sparkly, dewy grass.   Pauline hugs
     her and they spin.

43   CUT TO:                                                     43

     Margot watches from the upstairs window. The mother and
     daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle.
     Finally, Margot turns away -- she's in Pauline and Malcolm's
     room.

     She opens drawers: Underwear, socks, bras. Topless photos
     of Pauline posing in the bedroom. A photograph of Margot and
     Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar
     and Patty Smyth respectively.

     Margot grins.

     Another photo of Margot, Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky -
     - in their 20's.

     Margot's expression saddens. She opens another drawer.
     Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses.

     She flips through these and drops them on the bureau.

     Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers.
     She squints to read the labels. She opens one and shakes out
     a few blue pills into her palm. She swallows one and puts
     the rest in her pocket.

     More drawers open: Self-help books, incense, pamphlets on
     Buddhism. A stack of pornographic DVD's.

                         CLAUDE (O.S.)
               Hey.
     Margot starts and shoves the drawer shut.
                         MARGOT
               Hey. I'm just looking at Pauline's
               incense and self-help books. I
               don't understand it. This junk
               makes her look stupid and she's
               not. I don't like to think of her
               this way.

                         CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

                                                             54.


                         MARGOT
               She's such a hypocrite. Somehow
               I'm a kook for going to therapy,
               but she's got enough drugs here to
               medicate a...
                   (settles on a word)
               ...an elephant. And she's always
               with these losers.

                         CLAUDE
               Malcolm's not a loser.

                         MARGOT
               Claude...think about it.

                            CLAUDE
               He's cool.

                         MARGOT
               What makes you think he's cool?
                   (softens)
               I'm more talking about her
               investment in things like the Forum
               and ashrams.

                         CLAUDE
               What's the Forum?

                         MARGOT
               Like a cult.

                         CLAUDE
               She was in a cult?

                         MARGOT
               Years ago. She and Lenny also
               followed some guru who was a
               follower of the Mukdananda who made
               her drink his bath water. Who
               knows what she's doing now.
                          INGRID (O.S.)
               Margot!   Claude!
44   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          44
     Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds.
                            CLAUDE
               Wizard!
     We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell:

                                                         55.


                      PAULINE/INGRID
          Wizard!    Wiz!

Margot enters the frame.   The kids walk ahead.

                      MARGOT
          Wizard!    Here, boy!

She stands a few feet away from Pauline.   The kids can be
heard shouting in the distance.

                    MARGOT
          How long has he been gone?

                    PAULINE
          I don't know. Ingrid brought him
          in last night, but we couldn't find
          him this morning.

                      MARGOT
          Oh boy.

                    PAULINE
          Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?

                    MARGOT
          I don't know.

                      PAULINE
          You did.

                    MARGOT
          I guess I said something.

                    PAULINE
          You did. You don't have to tell
          him everything.

                    MARGOT
          He wants to know. If I don't tell
          him, he figures it out.

                    INGRID (O.S.)
          Where is Wizard?
Ingrid approaches with Claude.
                    PAULINE
          I don't know, honey.
Ingrid sinks into her mother's body.   Claude and Margot walk
ahead.

                                                             56.


                         CLAUDE
               You didn't let him go out into the
               road or something where something
               could've happened to him?

                         MARGOT
               Why would you think I'd do
               something like that? That's awful.

                           CLAUDE
               I just...    I'm just making sure.

                         MARGOT
               That's a terrible thing to say to
               me.

                         CLAUDE
               I didn't mean on purpose, I just
               meant maybe in case...you knew
               something. I'm sorry.

45   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                         45

     Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a
     white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled.

                           MARGOT
               Woa!

     Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a
     pad and paper in front of him.

                         MALCOLM
               Hey, sorry. I'm here.

                           MARGOT
               No, I...    I should've looked.

                         MALCOLM
               I'm just writing my vows. Trying
               to do something appropriate but
               also funny -- not jokey, more
               character based humor.
     Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm
     to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a
     long drink. Silence.
                         MALCOLM
               You having an okay time?
                           MARGOT
               Oh, yeah.    Besides Wizard getting --

                                                 57.


                     MALCOLM
           Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or
           else, I don't know...

                       MARGOT
           We won't.

                      MALCOLM
           Right, or else he's dead or
           something.
               (pause)
           It means a lot to Paul that you
           came.

                       MARGOT
           Yeah.

Silence.   Malcolm mumbles a tune.

                     MARGOT
           Oh God, this is the same toaster we
           had here as kids. Paul is so
           weird.

                     MALCOLM
           I hear you've heard the news.

                      MARGOT
           Yeah.   Congratulations.

                     MALCOLM
           Pretty cool. Hard to fully take
           in. It's a little abstract still.
           I haven't had that thing yet where
           you realize that you're not the
           most important person in the world.
           I'm anxious for that to happen. I
           guess I have to thank you -- I
           wouldn't know yet if you hadn't
           arrived.
                     MARGOT
           You're welcome.
                     MALCOLM
           Of course I can't help but worry
           I'll pass some not so great genes
           onto the kid. I mean, in my family
           there's a lot of hand washing, you
           know. I don't have it, but my
           brother does.
               (pause)
           You working on anything now?

                                                          58.


                     MARGOT
           Besides the thing with Dick?

                        MALCOLM
           Oh, right.

He nods.   She nods.    Silence.

                     MARGOT
           How about you?

                     MALCOLM
           Oh, I'm working on some acrylic
           paint --

                     MARGOT
           Nobody fills the ice cube trays.

Malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. Margot is looking in
the freezer. She takes out the trays and brings them to the
sink. She runs the water.

                     MARGOT
           Sorry, what were you --

                       MALCOLM
           Nothing.    It doesn't matter.

                     MARGOT
           No, what were you saying?

                     MALCOLM
           It really... Nothing.

                        MARGOT
           Okay.

She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full
trays.
                     MALCOLM
           I was saying I'm doing these
           abstractions in acrylic paint. But
           it's not... I'm not getting paid
           or anything. I don't know, I hate
           that question, "What do you do?"
                     MARGOT
           You asked me.
                     MALCOLM
           I know, but...

                                                             59.


     Malcolm exhales in frustration.

46   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          46

     Pauline and Malcolm open the gate to the Vogler's property.

                         MALCOLM
               I think we shouldn't mention the
               tree, we should let them know that
               there will be people and music on
               Saturday and it will be louder than
               usual.

                         PAULINE
               And that they can come for a glass
               of champagne. But you tell them.
               I think they respond to you better.

     They approach the Vogler's sun-worn and paint chipped house.

                         MALCOLM
               Well, I am ultimately one of them.
               You shouldn't've made me shave the
               stache.

                         PAULINE
                   (laughs)
               Yeah, right.

                         MALCOLM
               Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I
               was ever gay. Do you know what
               that's about?

                          PAULINE
               No.

     Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over
     his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.
                          PAULINE
               Hi.
     Vogler stops.   His face is jagged and worn.
                          PAULINE
               Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.
               We've met before. We're your
               neighbors.
     The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.

                                                           60.


                    VOGLER
          You gonna cut that tree down?

                    PAULINE
          Well, we grew up with that tree and
          we're getting married under it
          Saturday and --

She waits for Malcolm to jump in.    He doesn't.   Vogler says
softly, but sternly:

                    VOGLER
          The roots are growing into our
          property. It's rotting, it's
          killing our plants.

                    PAULINE
          We had a tree doctor out and he
          said it was healthy.

Pauline smacks Malcolm's arm.

                    PAULINE
          Would it hurt you to say anything?

                     MALCOLM
          What?   What do you want from me?

                    PAULINE
          You're making me do the whole
          fucking thing.

                    MALCOLM
          You brought up the tree.

                    PAULINE
          He brought up --

She stops herself.   She says to Vogler:
                    PAULINE
          I'm sorry... This was better
          thought-through back at the house.
Pauline's gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot
described earlier. He runs his hand through his hair as if
something might be caught in there.
                    PAULINE
          We were wondering if you and your
          wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name
          -- would like to come over for...

                                                           61.


                    VOGLER
          You should ask her. She makes the
          plans. I'm going to go in now.

He tramps inside.   The screen door bangs.

                    MALCOLM
          I felt like you didn't give me a
          chance to say what I wanted to say.

Pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away.
Malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.

                    MALCOLM
          I want to punch that guy in the
          nose!

                    PAULINE
          You've never hit anyone.

                    MALCOLM
          I have too!

                     PAULINE
          Who?

                    MALCOLM
          Lots of -- You don't know them.
          They're not around because I've
          punched them.

A smile breaks across Pauline's face.   Malcolm seethes.

                    MALCOLM
          Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not
          funny. I'll fucking punch your
          sister.

Malcolm clenches his fists.    He points at Vogler's place.
                    MALCOLM
          The threat is not out there. It's
          in our house. It's sleeping in my
          studio. I mean, I wouldn't
          actually hit her, but I feel...I
          feel like doing it. She's such a
          fucking idiot.
                    PAULINE
          She's not an idiot.    You might not
          like her --

                                                            62.


                    MALCOLM
          She is. She is an idiot!    You're
          an idiot.

                    PAULINE
          Jesus.

                    MALCOLM
          You're both fucking morons. I'm so
          fucking... I'm trying so hard.
          You don't give me any credit.

                    PAULINE
          What is wrong?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't know, I have the emotional
          version of whatever bad feng shui
          would be. I don't know. You tell
          me, you understand this shit.

                    PAULINE
          Did you drink your teas?

                    MALCOLM
          Yeah, I drank my fucking teas!
          Don't judge me now. Really, I
          think when you look back at this
          you're going to see I'm not acting
          like a crazy person. That this is
          the right reaction. In proportion
          with what is going on. This is
          right!

Malcolm looks around furiously. The only thing available to
him is a leafy stalk. He pulls on it, but it won't uproot.
He tears the leaves off in a rage.

                    PAULINE
          You have the most oddly self-
          conscious form of rage I've ever --

                    MALCOLM
          I hate you.
Exhausted he approaches her.   He says, still with anger:
                    MALCOLM
          Let's make love.

                                                             63.


47   CUT TO:                                                     47

     Pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. She
     looks up suddenly and stops: A man watches her from the lawn.
     He holds a bouquet of flowers. Pauline runs to him.

                           PAULINE
               Jim...

     They embrace.    Her hand cups the back of his neck.

                           CLAUDE (O.S.)
               Dad!

     Claude runs from the house.

48   EXT. PATIO - LATE DAY                                       48

     Pauline, Malcolm, Margot, Jim, Claude and Ingrid eat fish
     stew and peasant bread. Jim's flowers sit in a vase. He
     wears a tan knit bracelet that Ingrid made.

                         JIM
               It was a difficult    decision because
               Claude has so many    friends at
               school now, but it    is expensive and
               Bronx Science is a    great public
               school.

                         CLAUDE
               I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

                         MARGOT
               He's not a good test taker.

                         MALCOLM
               I went to Stuy.

                         MARGOT
                   (caught off-guard)
               Really?

                           MALCOLM
               Really.
                         CLAUDE
               I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's
               so expensive.

     Malcolm lifts up a bottle of Jameson from the floor near his
     chair and pours himself another stiff drink.

                                                64.


                    JIM
          Josh is a great test taker, but
          Claude thinks more abstractly.
          He's more creative. Right?

                    CLAUDE
          I guess so.

Jim smiles warmly at his son.

                    JIM
          I saw the one armed man who really
          has two arms at the bodega.

                    CLAUDE
          Did you give him confusing change?

                   JIM
          I did. I tripped him up with some
          nickels. And a Canadian quarter.

                    MALCOLM
          You know what I tried the other
          day? Sitting down to pee. Have
          you done this, Jim?

                     JIM
          No...no.

                    MALCOLM
          I did it as a lark. As a joke
          really. I was going to call
          Pauline in and say, guess what I'm
          doing here...

                    PAULINE
          I'm sorry I didn't get to have that
          experience.

                    MALCOLM
          I was thinking, you know, my dad
          used to say, "Why stand when you
          can sit." And this is a really
          good example of that. I mean, it
          took me so long to try because I
          was embarrassed.
              (to the sisters)
          You guys do it all the time.
                    MARGOT
          I never sit down in a public place.
          I squat and hover.

                                                           65.


Ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.

                     MALCOLM
          Anyway, I recommend it.     At least
          to try it.

                    PAULINE
          Jim, I'm sorry about the room.
          It's usually Malcolm's storage room
          so it's kind of make-shift right
          now.

                       JIM
          It's fine.

Margot stares at Jim.

                    JIM
          Margot, open your gift.

An unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside Margot's
plate.

                    MARGOT
          I get self-conscious opening
          presents in front of people.    This
          weekend is about Pauline.

                       PAULINE
          Oh...poo.     Open it Margot.

Margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the
tape. Pauline groans:

                    PAULINE
          Come on, get to it.

Margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.

                    MALCOLM
          Those look warm.
                    JIM
          I remember last year in Vermont you
          said your feet were freezing.
Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She
leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and
briskly on the lips.

                       MARGOT
          Thank you.

                                                             66.


49   INT. JIM'S CAR - NIGHT                                      49

     Jim drives with Margot in the passenger seat.

                         MARGOT
               I already have slippers.

                         JIM
               Well, that's okay.   Two sets are
               fine, right?

                         MARGOT
               It makes me sad to get a present
               that I already have.

                         JIM
               Why?

                         MARGOT
               It makes me feel like you don't
               know me.

     She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.

                         JIM
               What's wrong with your ear?

                         MARGOT
               I asked you not to come. I was so
               clear and you did it anyway so
               blithely.

                         JIM
               We need time alone to sort this
               out. You can't just run away --

                         MARGOT
               Okay, so we're here.   I'm giving
               you this time.
                         JIM
                   (trying a joke)
               Well, now you're putting too much
               pressure on me.
     Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back.   He takes
     a moment, preparing to speak. Then:
                         JIM
               What is that?
     His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They
     pass.

                                                                67.


                         MARGOT
               Keep driving.

     Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder.

                         MARGOT
               No...no...no. Jim, no.

                         JIM
               Let me just...

     Jim gets out of the car.     A sobbing woman crouches, cradling
     a bloody dog.

                         WOMAN
               Please help me.

     Jim comes toward her.

                         WOMAN
               Please help me. He got hit by a
               car. Please help me.

     Margot opens her door and steps out.

                         MARGOT
                   (warily)
               Jim...

     Jim kneels down by the whining pit bull.    The woman screams:

                          WOMAN
               Help me!

                         MARGOT
               Careful, he might bite you!

     Jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal.

50   INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT                                      50
     Jim drives, his front covered in blood. Margot is shot-gun.
     The lady rides in back with the panting pit in her lap.
                         WOMAN
               Hurry...he's dying.     He's dying.
     Margot puts her hands over her ears.    Jim speeds up.
                         WOMAN
               He didn't do anything. Roger is an
               innocent. He's an innocent
               creature.

                                                                68.


                          MARGOT
               Oh, God.

                          JIM
               Margot.

                         MARGOT
                   (whispering)
               I can't stand her.

51   EXT. VETERINARY HOSPITAL - NIGHT                             51

     Jim comes outside tucking his wallet in his back pocket.
     Margot sits on the car hood smoking a joint.

                         MARGOT
               You paid, didn't you?

                         JIM
               She didn't have her purse with her.
               It wasn't so expensive. Roger's
               going to live.

                         MARGOT
               I don't give a fuck about Roger.
               And...that makes me feel like shit.
               You make me feel like shit. I
               wouldn't have stopped.

                         JIM
               Of course you would've.

                         MARGOT
               No, I wouldn't've. I would have
               kept driving. I hate myself when
               I'm with you.

                         JIM
                   (frustrated)
               Margot, I'm not... I can't talk to
               you when you're this fucked up.

                         MARGOT
               You're just like Claude in that
               way...you make me feel guilty.
               Sometimes I find you so despicable.
     Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly
     removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders. He
     fishes into his pants pocket for his keys. Tears start down
     Margot's cheeks.

                                                                69.


                         JIM
               What's wrong?

                         MARGOT
               I don't know.
                   (pause)
               Before you gave me your sweater I
               think I didn't realize I was cold.

     Margot leans in to him, her forehead presses against his
     cheek. After a moment, he puts his arms around her.

                         MARGOT
                   (quietly)
               Take me home and go away.

52   INT./EXT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                52

     Margot smokes by the open door. She drinks a glass of white
     wine. Pauline eats from a left-over Chinese container.

                         MARGOT
               If it were someone else I'd
               understand it, I'd feel sympathy
               even. But since it's me, I just
               feel bad. And horribly critical.
               I haven't been able to tell Claude
               what's happening. And I have to.
               I'm going to.
                   (frustrated)
               How can I be all these people? How
               can I be married to Jim. And fuck
               Dick. And want them both and then
               neither of them...

                         PAULINE
               I know. We're at the age where
               we're becoming invisible to men and
               if a guy wants to fuck us, it's
               very tempting.
                         MARGOT
               What are you saying?
                         PAULINE
               I'm saying, if you get your sense
               of self from being fuckable and
               that starts to wane -- it's very
               hard. I almost had an affair too.
               But you know, you don't have to do
               it. You can, I don't know, get a
               manicure or something.

                                                        70.


Margot grows furious.   She turns to hide her face.

                    PAULINE
          You know I tell people you're my
          closest friend. I really miss you.

                    MARGOT
              (barely)
          Me too.

                    PAULINE
          But I can't help feeling that you
          really came to my wedding because I
          live a mile away from the guy
          you're fucking.

                    MARGOT
          Come on, Pauline. You make it
          sound like I'm using you.

                    PAULINE
          Yeah.

There is a long silence between them. Finally, Pauline
indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril.

                    PAULINE
          You have a...

Margot clears her nose quickly with her finger.

                    MARGOT
          Did I get it?

                    PAULINE
          Yeah, I think so.

                    MARGOT
              (suddenly)
          Paul, what are you doing getting
          married to this guy? He's not good
          enough for you. He's so coarse,
          he's like guys we rejected when we
          were sixteen. You know...don't
          make a mistake like this.
              (pause)
          I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to
          say that, but you know I'm truthful
          so... Would you rather I lie?

                    PAULINE
          Who should I be with then?

                                                               71.


     A smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures
     turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground.
     Garbage is strewn across the driveway.

                         MARGOT (O.S.)
               Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.
               I will call the police. This is
               our property. Pick that up.

     Pauline remains seated at the table, stunned.    Margot comes
     back inside.

                            MARGOT
               Creeps.

53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING                                     53

     Malcolm crams the trash back in the cans. He sees something
     amidst the milk cartons and corn husks. He reaches down and
     lifts up a severed pig's hoof.

54   EXT. FIELD - MORNING                                        54

     Claude and Ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to Wizard.

                         CLAUDE
               Dogs usually come back, I think.

                         INGRID
               What happened to your dad?

                         CLAUDE
               He went to Vermont.

                         INGRID
               He didn't want to come to the
               wedding?

                         CLAUDE
               I don't think he could...    I think
               he couldn't.
                   (pause)
               You want to see me dance?
                            INGRID
               Okay.
     Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a
     rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye.
                         INGRID
                   (under her breath)
               Wizard...

                                                         72.


The animal is gone.

A figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the
Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks.
Ingrid's attention goes to him.

                    CLAUDE
          You're not watching.

The boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its
tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few
feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back
as it lands at their feet.

                    BOY
          Where are you going?

                    CLAUDE
              (stopping)
          We have to get home.

                    BOY
          Is that your girlfriend?

                    CLAUDE
          No, she's my cousin.

                    BOY
          You a fruity?

                      CLAUDE
          Um...no.

                    BOY
              (to Ingrid)
          You a fruity?

                      INGRID
                (with certainty)
          No.
                    BOY
          We will hurt you.
Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away.
                    INGRID
          He's a Vogler.

                    CLAUDE
          He's just a stupid boy.

                                                                73.


     Claude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows.
     Claude's gait quickens.

                         INGRID
               Hold it, I have a rock in my
               sandal.

                         CLAUDE
               Come on, Ingrid.

     Ingrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is
     behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over.

                            INGRID
               Oww!

     Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude.
     They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass.

                         CLAUDE
               Get him off me. Ingrid!

     Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house.

     Claude wrestles with the boy. The boy growls. He grabs hold
     of Claude's arms and sinks his teeth into Claude's shoulder.

                            CLAUDE
               Ayy!     Help me!

     Claude kicks and yanks himself free.     He runs wildly.

     Close on Claude.    Tears stream down.   He coughs and spits.

55   INT. HOUSE - SAME                                               55

     Claude bursts through the front door. Ingrid sees Claude and
     runs to the kitchen. Margot, in a suit, goes over notes.

                         MARGOT
               Woa, don't run so fast.
                         CLAUDE
               There's a boy! He bit me!
                         MARGOT
                   (alarmed)
               Who bit you?
                           CLAUDE
               A boy.    A Vogler!   Where's Ingrid?

                                                                74.


                         MARGOT
               Let me see.

     He tilts his head, she leans down and looks at his neck.
     There are red and purple bite marks.

                         MARGOT
                   (rising)
               I'm calling the police.

     Claude grabs her arm.

                         CLAUDE
               No, don't! It'll get worse. Why
               did you say anything to them?

                         MARGOT
               Claude, this isn't my fault.

                         CLAUDE
               That boy bit me because you
               couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.

                         MARGOT
               Claude, you're being a jerk.

                          CLAUDE
               You shit in your shoes and then you
               fuck them!

     Margot smacks Claude in the face.   Ingrid stares wide eyed.

56   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                         56

     A placard reads: A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick
     Koosman. People mull about with drinks. Pauline and Claude
     admire the display of Margot's books.

                         PAULINE
               You really want to know? I'll tell
               you. She wrote a story about Lenny
               and me.
                   (flips through pages)
               Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were
               talking almost every day at this
               point and there was no warning.
               Maybe a couple of remarks that
               she'd used some things of ours...
               Then The New Yorker comes -- we
               have a subscription -- and there's
               the story and... It's things we
               said and did -- stuff I told her in
               confidence.
                         (MORE)

                                                                75.

                         PAULINE (CONT'D)
               I think it helped end our marriage.
               I read it and thought, "She hates
               me."

                         CLAUDE
               She doesn't hate you.

     Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister.

                         PAULINE
               You think? Margot tried to murder
               me when we were girls. She put me
               on a baking sheet, sprinkled me
               with paprika and put me in the
               oven.

     The crowd files in.   Margot and Dick stand in a corner.

                         MARGOT
               Jim was here.

     Dick flips through some notes.

                         DICK
               Is Jim still writing?

                          MARGOT
                   (nods)
               I told him to go to Vermont without
               me.

                         DICK
               I'd love to see him tell a linear
               story for a change. Jim never
               wanted to make it easy for the
               reader, did he. The nicest man
               I've ever met, but he can't play
               the game.
                         MARGOT
               I'm not joining him. I'm going to
               stay here and then...we'll see.
               Right. Okay?
                         DICK
               I didn't ask you to do that.
                   (pause)
               The guy's pointing at us...

                                                               76.


58   CUT TO:                                                     58

     Margot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of
     rows of fold-out chairs. Only a few empty seats remain.
     Pauline and Claude sit in the back.

                         DICK
               I'm very interested in your story
               "Middle Children."

     Some people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets
     started.

                         DICK
               The father is a loathsome character
               yet we also feel a strange sympathy
               for him.

                         MARGOT
               Yeah, well I was very interested in
               exploring a father-daughter
               relationship. While he clings
               desperately to her, suffocates her
               really, he also silently resents
               the responsibility of parenthood.

                         DICK
               There's this sexualized push-pull
               with Daphne which I find --

                         MARGOT
               He craves isolation really. I
               always thought of him as someone
               who so over identifies with
               everyone around him that he begins
               to lose all sense of himself.

                         DICK
               You make his only recourse to
               abandon his family, including his
               beloved daughter.

                         MARGOT
               Right, that's true.   That's true.
                         DICK
               I write historical fiction so I
               don't have to answer to this, but I
               wonder for someone who writes so
               nakedly about family, how
               autobiographical is this portrait?

     Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.

                                                           77.


                    MARGOT
          My father was a loving person. He
          had his days, of course, but...he
          was devoted to us as children. I
          wouldn't have written this portrait
          were it true.

Pauline nods slightly.

                    DICK
          But I'm interested in how the
          father could be in fact a portrait
          of you.
Margot stares, dumbstruck.

                    MARGOT
          Umm...I don't... Why do you assume
          it's based on... We all take from
          life. I had to have our
          refrigerator repaired the other day
          at our apartment in Manhattan. I
          was alone with a guy, I think he
          was Puerto Rican, sent over
          by...Whirlpool, I think it is who
          made our fridge. Although he said
          he worked for an independent
          organization who Whirlpool
          subcontracts. I think he was
          retarded. There was an anger in
          him and suddenly I became afraid
          for my life. I called Jim at NYU.
          I asked him to come home.

Margot stops.   Her face is awash in sweat.

Pauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest.    His
eyes widen, fixed on his mother.

                    MARGOT
          It might be Frigidaire... I'm
          sorry... I don't... I'm not sure
          what I'm... I think I need to take
          a moment...

She stands and walks off the stage. She realizes she still
has the mike. She goes back and places it on her seat.
                    MARGOT
              (almost incoherently)
          You're an asshole...

                                                             78.

     Margot grabs a pill from her pocket, puts it on her tongue
     and drinks from the faucet. There is a knocking. Margot
     opens the door. Claude looks up at her. Pauline and Dick
     wait in the background.

                         MARGOT
               I need to be alone right now, okay?

                         CLAUDE
               What's wrong?

                         MARGOT
               I don't know. I'll tell you
               sometime. Go on.

                         CLAUDE
               Are you sure?

                        MARGOT
               Yes. Go with mom.    I'll see you
               later.

                         CLAUDE
               You said, mom.

                         MARGOT
                   (snapping)
               But you know what I mean. Go with
               Pauline. Jesus, do I...do I need
               to spell it out for you?
                   (she points)
               Go. With. Her.

60   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            60

     A simple, spare space, empty except for Pauline and Claude.

                         PAULINE
               Are you okay?
                           CLAUDE
               I'm okay.
                          PAULINE
               You're your mom's favorite.     Do you
               know that?
                         CLAUDE
               I don't think she has a favorite.

                                                       79.


                    PAULINE
          She's always liked you best.   More
          than Jim even.

                     CLAUDE
          But they're married.   It's
          different.

                    PAULINE
          But she still loves you best. It's
          hard, I think, to find people in
          the world you love more than your
          family.

                    CLAUDE
          I like Malcolm.

                     PAULINE
          Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do
          too.
               (pause)
          I can teach you to swim if you
          like.

                    CLAUDE
          No, thanks.

Claude looks at the floor. His sneaker rests next to her
open toed sandals. She taps his foot with hers.

                    PAULINE
          Has your mother talked to you yet?

                    CLAUDE
          I don't think so.   About what?

                    PAULINE
          Are you okay? It's hard to see
          your mom like that -- get attacked
          like that. Right? It was mean
          what he did. I think it was really
          shitty.
                    CLAUDE
          Mm hm.
                    PAULINE
          You know, I think your mom's going
          through a rough time right now
          and...whatever she tells you...like
          if she says she's leaving your
          father...remember that she often
          changes her mind and...

                         PAULINE (CONT'D)
               I don't want you to worry about
               anything right now.

     Claude says nothing.

61   EXT. HOUSE - LATE DAY                                     61

     Pauline's Volvo rolls into the drive. She and Claude get out
     of the front seats. Margot climbs out of the back holding a
     big cake box. No one speaks.

     Malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a
     chainsaw toward the oak tree. Ingrid runs to her mom.

                         INGRID
               He's cutting it down.

                            PAULINE
               Good.

     Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio.

                         MAISY
               My dad's late to pick me up.    I
               hope I'm not a pain.

                         PAULINE
               You're not a pain.

     Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with
     ice. The tent is up. The tables and chairs are placed
     around the lawn. She watches Malcolm prepare to take the
     tree down. She puts her pinky in her ear and twists. Claude
     approaches.

                         MARGOT
               I told Paul I didn't want you guys
               to come.

                         CLAUDE
               I thought it was interesting.
                         MARGOT
               What did Paul say?
                         CLAUDE
               I think she liked it.
                         MARGOT
               Yeah, right. Did you talk about me
               afterwards?
                            CLAUDE
               No.

                                                           81.


                    MARGOT
          I can tell you're lying.

                    CLAUDE
          We didn't, mom.

                    MARGOT
          I don't trust her.

                    CLAUDE
          She really loves you.   She does.

Margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.

                    MARGOT
          Pauline told me she's very
          disappointed in you.

                    CLAUDE
          Why?

                    MARGOT
          She thinks you laze about the
          house. Ingrid is always offering
          to help clean or cook. She made
          bracelets for all the guests. Even
          Malcolm puts up the tent. You just
          wait until everyone else does it
          for you.

                    CLAUDE
          That's not true.

                    MARGOT
          It is true. You're never helpful.
          I wish I had taught you better
          manners.

                    CLAUDE
          I can try to make popovers.   If I
          can remember how.

                    MARGOT
          Don't bother.
She looks at him with grave disappointment.
                    CLAUDE
          Why are you looking at me like
          that?

                                                                82.


                         MARGOT
               I just see how much you've changed.
               Your body language. You used to be
               rounder and more graceful. You're
               so stiff now. So blase.

                         CLAUDE
               What do you mean?

                         MARGOT
                   (retreating)
               I can't explain it.

     Margot shakes her head.   She's suddenly distraught.

                         MARGOT
               It's okay though.

                         CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

     Claude looks devastated. He starts toward the beach.
     Margot's eyes well up -- she says, trying to make things
     better:

                         MARGOT
               You're still handsome.

62   EXT. HOUSE - SAME                                             62

     Pauline marches toward Malcolm.    Malcolm wears the safety
     goggles and revs the chainsaw.

                         PAULINE
               Are you able to do this yourself?

                         MALCOLM
               Pauline, do you want me to cut it
               down or not?
                         PAULINE
               Watch the tent.
     The jagged blades pierce the trunk.   Pauline crunches her
     face. Malcolm stops suddenly.
     He walks around the tree and inspects the bark.
                         MALCOLM
                   (indicating his fleece)
               I liked how it looked on Vogler.
     Pauline starts to say something -- stops.    Then:

                                                         83.


                    PAULINE
          I think it's over between Dick and
          Margot. He was so cruel to her
          today. And poor Claude had to
          watch it all. She should just get
          out of the marriage and then she
          can fuck whoever she wants, you
          know. It's cowardly. And Dick
          Koosman. What a choice. I
          mean...you know?

                    MALCOLM
          I agree. I hate the idea of Dick
          fucking Margot.

                    PAULINE
          What does that mean?   You want to
          fuck Margot?

                    MALCOLM
          Pauline, that's not what I said.

                    PAULINE
          I know you have a crush on her, you
          already told me that.

Malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again.   They yell
over the noise:

                    MALCOLM
          I didn't say that. I said I
          thought she was attractive after
          you grilled me. She has no
          interest in me anyway. Not that it
          would matter if she did.

                    PAULINE
          Have you ever done anything like
          that.
                    MALCOLM
          What do you mean?
                    PAULINE
          Have you ever cheated on me?
                    MALCOLM
          No!
Malcolm shuts the motor.
                    MALCOLM
          Can I do this?

                                      84.


          PAULINE
Those emails you had with that
student of mine.

          MALCOLM
    (exhales)
Uh huh.

          PAULINE
Did that...I know you said it was
nothing.

             MALCOLM
It was.

             PAULINE
I just...     Can you say it again?

          MALCOLM
I just did. Now, can I cut down
the tree?

          PAULINE
You never did anything with her?

          MALCOLM
No. She emailed me after we met at
that reading at the college and...
You know we were friends.

          PAULINE
Right, just a regular friendship
between you and a twenty year old
girl.

           MALCOLM
Pauline, how many times do I have
to say it.

          PAULINE
But...why don't I believe it?
          MALCOLM
Because Margot can't understand why
you're with me and now when she's
around you look for things.
          PAULINE
    (hesitates)
You promise.
             MALCOLM
I promise.

                                                         85.


Pauline looks at him long and hard.   Malcolm takes off his
goggles.

                      PAULINE
          Okay.    I'm sorry.

                       MALCOLM
          It's okay.

Malcolm and Pauline continue to stare at one another. He
guns the chainsaw. Tears spill suddenly from his eyes.
Pauline startles. He flicks the switch off.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm going to tell you something.

                    PAULINE
              (suddenly terrified)
          What?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't want to lose you, though.
          Okay?

Pauline's face goes pale.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm going to tell you...    Just let
          me... Maisy...

Pauline teeters.

                    PAULINE
          I don't want to know.

                    MALCOLM
          ...we didn't really do anything.
          We were goofing around, I was
          making fun of her cause she dates a
          jock...
                    PAULINE
          I don't want to know.
                    MALCOLM
          I shouldn't've put myself in that
          position, I know that. We brushed
          lips really. It was barely a kiss.
          And then we stopped. That was it.
His nose runs.    He wipes it messily with his arm.

                                                                86.


                         MALCOLM
               Our tongues touched. I don't want
               to under-sell it either. I mean...
               We made out. I made out with her.
               I don't know why. I don't even
               like her. It's been a heady time.
                   (Pauline says nothing)
               What are you thinking? Please,
               tell me what you're thinking.

     Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the
     trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. It
     doesn't budge. In frustration and rage, she runs.

63   CUT TO:                                                      63

     Ingrid is the only one on the patio as Pauline approaches.

                         INGRID
               Has anyone seen Wizard?

                          PAULINE
               No.   Where's Maisy?

                         INGRID
               Upstairs, I think with Claude.

64   INT. PAULINE'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY - DAY                         64

     Pauline enters in a daze.   A toilet flushes.    Maisy comes out
     of Pauline's bathroom.

                         MAISY
               Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I
               hope that's okay I used yours.

     Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove
     grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.

                         MAISY
               I love your wedding dress.   It's so
               unconventional and great.
     Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and
     Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at
     the pictures too.
     Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows.
     Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right
     behind her.
                         MAISY
               Is everything okay?

                                                              87.


                         PAULINE
                   (pause)
               Nothing.

     Maisy stops at the landing. Claude sits at the bottom of the
     staircase playing with a string.

                         MAISY
               Claude, do you want to play
               croquet?

                          CLAUDE
               Okay.

     Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisy's lower
     back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy
     turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like
     she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.

     Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg.
     Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.

65   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             65

     The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree.
     Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet
     away.

     In the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the
     driveway. Maisy hurries toward him.

     Ingrid says, buried in the noise:

                         INGRID
               There's Dick.

     Malcolm sees Dick.   He pushes the blade harder into the wood.

                         INGRID
               Is it almost ready?
                         MALCOLM
                   (distracted)
               Almost.
     Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He
     immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear
     creeps up his neck.

     Dick speeds up.
     Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts
     toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused.

                                                           88.


Dick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long
wooden stairs to the beach.

Malcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath.
Sweat pours down his face and body.

Dick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow.
His jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a
time.

Malcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can
sideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet
sinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward.

He looks up -- Dick lunges.

Dick pounds Malcolm's head and face.     Malcolm throws his arms
up and tries to block the punches.

                    MALCOLM
          I didn't do anything!    I didn't do
          anything!

                    DICK
          Fucking sleazebag!

Dick gets up.   He kicks Malcolm hard.

                    DICK
          I don't ever want to see you again.

Malcolm balls himself up against a rock.    He cries:

                    MALCOLM
          Fuck off, dickhead.

Dick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard.

                     MALCOLM
          Ow!
Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away.    Malcolm
screams:
                    MALCOLM
          Fucking dickbag! She's lying!
He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
                    MALCOLM
              (choking on tears)
          Oh, man.

                                                               89.


     There's a rustling noise in the wind. Malcolm looks -- a mud-
     and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile.

66   CUT TO:                                                     66

     Wheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with
     Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from
     the porch.

67   INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - SAME                         67

     Pauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers,
     silverware, napkins, dishes. Margot enters. Claude follows.

                         MARGOT
               Come with me to New York.

                         PAULINE
               I can't talk about it --

                         MARGOT
               Okay, but you can't marry him. You
               have to go now. We can think about
               what to do with the baby --

                         PAULINE
                   (stands)
               Margot, I can't --

                         MARGOT
               Don't turn vague, listen to me --

                         PAULINE
               I want you to pack all your things
               and get out of here. You can take
               our car and leave it at the ferry.

                         MARGOT
                   (startled)
               What?
                         CLAUDE
               I'll help out more.   I can make
               popovers.
     Pauline looks at Claude strangely.    She leans down and kisses
     him on the lips.
                         PAULINE
               Do you love me?
                   (Claude nods)
               Good.

                                                        90.


                     MARGOT
          Don't take this out on me?   I'm on
          your side.

                    PAULINE
          No, you're not. You're not.

                    MARGOT
          I've kept my mouth shut because --

                    PAULINE
          No, you haven't kept your mouth
          shut! No you haven't...kept your
          mouth shut...

                    MARGOT
          Okay, I told you and I was right.
          He's done an insane thing. You
          don't know this man. What he did
          is criminal.

                    PAULINE
          Margot, I can't...

                    MARGOT
          It's pedophilia.

                     PAULINE
          Get out!

Pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the
table. The plates shatter. Silence save for their
breathing.

                    PAULINE
          Becky and I talk about you -- about
          what a monster you are. Is it
          cause Mom gave me the house? Can't
          I have anything? What was I
          thinking? I let you in. Get!
          Out!

                    MARGOT
          What? What are you saying? I
          don't recognize you -- it's like
          you're channelling someone.
                    PAULINE
              (suddenly)
          Ingrid!

                                                              91.


68   EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS                                      68

     The purple of Ingrid's batik shirt shines in the grass
     beneath the tree.

     The trunk -- a gash at its base -- teeters.

     Pauline takes off into the field.

     Ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air
     with her finger.

     Pauline sprints --

                            PAULINE
               Ingrid!

     Ingrid says to no one in particular:

                            INGRID
               What?

     Pauline's breaths are rapid, jagged.

     Ingrid stands.

     A wind whips up.    The tree sways.

     Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself
     away from the tree.

                            INGRID
               Ow!

     Ingrid sobs as they run. Pauline looks back. The tree is
     still standing. They embrace a few feet out of its range.

                         INGRID
               It wasn't going to fall!
                            PAULINE
               I'm sorry.
     Malcolm trudges up the stairs.   He's bloody and tattered.
     Wizard trots behind him.
                            INGRID
               Wizard!
     She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar.   The three of
     them stand a few feet apart.
     There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --

                                                             92.


     -- crack --

     Malcolm pulls both girls toward him --

     The tree topples -- the thick trunk rips through the wedding
     tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence --

     -- onto the Vogler's property.

69   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                            69

     The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the
     steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit
     stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming
     lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.

                         CLAUDE
               I thought you couldn't drive.

                         MARGOT
                   (irritated)
               I can drive. Why does everyone say
               that? I used to drive.

     They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them.
     The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:

                         PAULINE
               We have to call people and cancel.

                         INGRID
               What happened? Can I still sing?

     Margot rolls down the window.

                         MARGOT
                   (to Claude)
               You do smell.

                          CLAUDE
               Well, I'm not wearing any
               deodorant.
     They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend.
     The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the
     brake.
                         MARGOT
               Shit.

                         CLAUDE
               What?

                                                             93.


                         MARGOT
               I don't think...
                   (she pumps again)
               No... We don't have brakes.

                         PAULINE
                   (resigned)
               The brakes are bad, that's right.

                         CLAUDE
               What does that mean?

                         MARGOT
               What do you think it means?

                         CLAUDE
               I mean, what can we do?

     The car coasts faster down the hill.

                         CLAUDE
               Mom.

     Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front.

     Pauline wraps her body around her daughter.

     Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn
     into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck.
     The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of
     a tree.

70   CUT TO:                                                   70

     Margot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony
     white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down.
     They're all covered in sweat and there's dirt caked on their
     feet and ankles.

                         MARGOT
               I ruined these shoes.
     Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain.   She races
     behind a tree. Margot follows.
                         INGRID
               Mom, are you okay?
                         PAULINE (O.S.)
               Don't look!

     Margot stops.

                                                              94.


                          PAULINE (O.S.)
               Shit!

                         INGRID
               Mom, what happened?

                          PAULINE (O.S.)
               Nothing.

     Margot steps to see around the trunk. The kids follow
     behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt.
     She tosses them in the brush.

                          PAULINE
               Fuck.
     Margot turns to the kids.   Ingrid hides a smile.

                         CLAUDE
               Did she poop in her pants?

                         MARGOT
               It happens to everyone. Not just
               babies. It'll happen to you too
               someday.

71   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                            71

     Margot and Claude sit, streaked with mud and perspiration.
     Margot drinks a beer, Claude a Coke. Margot pops a blue pill
     in her mouth and swallows. Ingrid swings on the rail.

     Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her
     sister. She takes the beer and swigs.

                         PAULINE
               I left mom and Becky a message.

                         MARGOT
               I don't think mom knows how to work
               the machine.
     Margot puts her pinky in her ear.

                         MARGOT
               I can hear it flapping.
                         PAULINE
               You should take care of that.   It
               can hatch eggs.

                                                              95.


     Claude turns his head. In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs.
     Vogler and the Vogler boy. She sings along to the radio.
     She runs her hand through her son's hair gently. He nestles
     into her shoulder.

72   EXT. SEASIDE TOWN STREET - EVENING                         72

     The four of them get out of a taxi.   A small, peeling hotel.

73   INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               73

     A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall
     carpet. Pauline combs Ingrid's hair on one of the two double
     beds. Ingrid practices her wedding song. Claude sits on the
     other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: Margot
     stands with her back to him. She talks on her cell phone in
     a whisper. She hangs up. Claude walks inside. The sink
     drips.

                         MARGOT
               Sweety, there's a bus that leaves
               to Vermont from town tomorrow
               morning. I just talked to your dad
               and he's going to pick you up.

                         CLAUDE
               Aren't you coming?

                          MARGOT
               No.

                          CLAUDE
               Why not?

                         MARGOT
               I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.

     Claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet.

                         CLAUDE
               I don't want to go tomorrow.
     The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting.
     Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are
     already looking out.
     Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people
     hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the
     rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed
     in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard
     coffins.

                                                       96.


                    PAULINE
          There's Malcolm.

Pauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see
it isn't him. Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of
tears.

                    PAULINE
          I can't live in that house alone.

                    MARGOT
          You're going to be fine.

                    PAULINE
          Maybe...maybe I could get a place
          in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or
          something. People are living there
          right?

                    MARGOT
          You don't want to live there.   It's
          all young people.

                    PAULINE
          But what do you think of that idea?

                    MARGOT
          Maybe. Let's see. You know if you
          don't want to come with me, I'm
          sure mom will let you stay with her
          --

                    PAULINE
              (through tears)
          You're already trying to pass me
          off on mom...

                    MARGOT
          Don't say that. Come on, you'll
          come home with us.
                    PAULINE
          You don't even know where you're
          going to live. You might have to
          move in with mom too.
Margot tightens.
                    PAULINE
          What? Oh.
              (mouthing a whisper)
          Didn't you tell him?

                                                              97.


     Margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the
     window.

74   CUT TO:                                                    74

     Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long
     nightshirt that reads: I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall.
     She enters the bathroom. She mutters to herself.

                         PAULINE
               What have I done? What have I
               done?

     Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few
     stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of
     signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She
     puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She
     watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.

                         CLAUDE
               What?

                         MARGOT
               Nothing. Just then I felt so much
               love for you.

75   CUT TO:                                                    75

     Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits
     on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline
     marches around and across to the other side of the room. She
     snatches the book out of Margot's hands.

                         MARGOT
               Hey!

                         PAULINE
               You cannot write about this.   You
               can't have it.
                         MARGOT
               I wasn't writing about you.
                         PAULINE
               You already took a part of my life,
               you can't have any more. And that
               goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and
               Wizard. We all own our own rights.
               They're not for sale.
                         MARGOT
               Give it back.

                                                          98.


Pauline glances at the book.

                    PAULINE
          If I could read your handwriting
          I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I
          ever see a story that involves a
          hotel room or any of this shit, I
          will fucking take your bowels out.

Pauline thrusts the book back at Margot --

CUT TO:

The kids sleep in one bed.    Margot and Pauline lie awake in
the other.

                    PAULINE
          You've now successfully ruined two
          of my marriages.

                    MARGOT
          You're not wearing any underwear.

                    PAULINE
          It's hot, I'm pregnant.    Move over.
          Jesus.

                    MARGOT
          You're not hot, your feet are cold.

                    PAULINE
          Stop touching me. I am so hot.
          Feel my head.

Margot puts her lips to Pauline's forehead.

                    MARGOT
          You have a fever.

                    PAULINE
          I don't have a fever... I'm
          pregnant...are you always like
          this?
                    MARGOT
          Get used to it... Mom and Becky
          share a bed -- you and I will
          probably get the other.

                    PAULINE
          You should just go to Vermont.

                                                            99.


                         MARGOT
               I was thinking -- you know if you
               want -- you and Ingrid could go to
               Vermont. Keep Claude company and
               Jim adores you.

                         PAULINE
               You don't like Malcolm because
               you're not attracted to him.

                         MARGOT
               Will you do it?

                         PAULINE
               No. I won't do that for you.

                         MARGOT
                   (pause)
               Did you two talk about me in town?
               What did you say?

                         PAULINE
                   (pause)
               I told him you often change your
               mind.

76   INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - MORNING                            76

     Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front.
     Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot
     drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids
     have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a
     plastic red basket lie between them.

     A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The
     music begins. The man sways and sings "On and On" by Stephen
     Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes
     moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the
     wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:
                         MARGOT
               I'm sorry, sweety. There's
               something wrong with me.
                         PAULINE
               I'm going to call him.
     Margot quickly turns to her sister.
                          MARGOT
               No.   Don't. I'm telling you.

                                                            100.


                         PAULINE
               I...I need some clothes and things.

                         MARGOT
               He should get the hell out of our
               house.

                         PAULINE
               Okay. I'll tell him to get the
               hell out of our house.

     Pauline walks over to a pay phone.

77   CUT TO:                                                      77

     Pauline holds the receiver to her ear. She stares at a
     drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the
     pay phone. Malcolm is crying.

                         MALCOLM'S VOICE
               The tent looks so lonely.

                         PAULINE
               It has no one to get married in it.

78   EXT. HOUSE - INTERCUT                                        78

     Malcolm sits in the grass, the tree and wreckage behind him.

                         MALCOLM
               I know. And it's smashed. I'm
               such a fucking idiot. Please don't
               take me seriously. I mean take me
               seriously, but not the fucked up
               parts, you know. I love you so
               much. Please marry me.

                         PAULINE
               You can't do what you did again.
               Do you understand?
                            MALCOLM
               I promise.
                         PAULINE
               No matter how tempting.
     At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent-
     mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it
     onto the floor.
     Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to
     Claude.

                                                         101.


                    INGRID
          You left it in my room.

It's a piece of fingernail.   He hesitates then puts it in his
pocket.

At the phone: Pauline rests her head against the wall.
Malcolm is bawling on the other end.

                    PAULINE
          I don't know. I don't know.

Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:

                    MALCOLM
          I ate some of the cake.   I don't
          know why, but I did it.

                    PAULINE
          What was... How was it?

                    MALCOLM
          Good.

                    PAULINE
          It's not too sweet? They sometimes
          make their stuff too sweet.

                    MALCOLM
          Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't
          even notice... They fucked up the
          cake. How sad. I love our little
          baby. I miss you.

                    PAULINE
          I miss you too. Maybe we should do
          another seminar.

Malcolm says something incomprehensible.
                    PAULINE
          I can't understand you, honey.
Margot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her
sister.
                    INGRID
          There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
Margot startles and looks out the window. Across the street
is an older woman, 70's, and a large woman, mid 30's, eating
ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.

                                                                   102.


                         PAULINE
               They didn't get my message.

     Pauline now stands above them.

                          MARGOT
               I told you she can't work the
               machine --

     Ingrid's chair scrapes as she stands.      She takes her mother's
     hand. Margot remains seated.

                          PAULINE
               What?   You're not coming?

                         MARGOT
               I'm coming, I'm coming.       What did
               he say?

     Pauline and Ingrid head for the door.      Claude waits for
     Margot.

                         MARGOT
               What did he say?

     She grabs her bags and drops some bills on the table.

                         MARGOT
                   (to herself)
               Don't worry, I got it.

79   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                            79

     The sisters and children come outside.      The mother and Becky
     now idle further down the street.

                            PAULINE/INGRID
               Mom!/Nana!

     Margot takes Claude's arm and walks quickly in the opposite
     direction. Claude, confused, glances over his shoulder.
                         MARGOT
               Don't look. Keep walking.
                         CLAUDE
               Why are we --
                         MARGOT
               We have to get you to your bus.

                                                            103.


80   CUT TO:                                                   80

     A huge parking lot. A bus in the distance.   Claude tries to
     keep pace with his mother.

                         CLAUDE
               Did you do something?

                         MARGOT
               What do you mean, do something?

                         CLAUDE
               I mean, why is the wedding not
               happening? Is there something that
               you did?

                         MARGOT
               Pauline has transferred all her
               stuff onto me. I don't understand
               her anymore. Why'd she pick this
               man? It is really berserk. And
               you know, she referred to me as her
               closest friend. We never see one
               anoth --

     An unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is
     unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak:

                         MARGOT
               I mean we're not close.   Even if we
               want to be. You know?

                         CLAUDE
               But was there anything real?

                         MARGOT
               No! How many times do I have to
               say it? Jesus. You think so
               little of me.
                   (through her sobs)
               It's good you're going. You
               shouldn't be around me either. I'd
               go if I were you...
                         CLAUDE
               Will you find Pauline and Nana
               after I leave?
                         MARGOT
                   (half-serious)
               I don't know. Maybe I'll go to
               church.

                                                         104.


Margot is sweating. She wipes her brow with her sleeve. She
periodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following.

                    CLAUDE
              (growing nervous)
          Are you angry at me?

                       MARGOT
          No, honey.     I'm not mad at you.

                    CLAUDE
          I don't want to go with you mad at
          anyone.

                    MARGOT
          Everything's fine.    I'm not mad at
          anyone.

Up ahead is a tiny depot.    People climb onto a white bus.

                    CLAUDE
          Can you come with me?

                    MARGOT
          No, you know that.
              (pause)
          We should talk about the next few
          months a little bit and what's
          going to happen --

                    CLAUDE
          I don't like Vermont.

                    MARGOT
          Your dad will be very happy to see
          you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to
          hang out.

                    CLAUDE
          Please come, mom.
                    MARGOT
              (suddenly irritable)
          Claude, stop it. Okay?
She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man.
Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply.
                    MARGOT
          You used to need me to watch you
          when you played.

                                                       105.


                    CLAUDE
          What do you mean?

                    MARGOT
              (vaguely)
          When you first started to play with
          friends, you wouldn't do it unless
          I watched you. You were afraid I
          would go out the back door. I
          don't know where I would go. Our
          yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.

She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T-
shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly:

                    CLAUDE
          I masturbated last night. While
          everyone was asleep I went into the
          bathroom and did it.

                    MARGOT
          You don't have to tell me, sweety.

The bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed.

                    MARGOT
          You've got to go.

Margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's
hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses.

                    CLAUDE
          How will you get home?

                    MARGOT
          I don't know. I'll see. Maybe
          Dick can drive me to the...
              (pause)
          Jesus, I lost the word for a
          second. The train.
                    CLAUDE
          Uh huh.
He looks at her longingly.
                    MARGOT
          Come on. You always don't want to
          leave me and you always have a good
          time once you do.
              (provocatively)
          I think you like getting away from
          me.

                                                      106.


                      CLAUDE
          I do not.    I like hanging out with
          you.

She hugs him.   He clutches her.

                    CLAUDE
          The world feels strange to me right
          now.

Margot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and
releases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his
wrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face.

                      CLAUDE
          What?

                    MARGOT
          They make your face look too wide.

Claude removes them and puts them back in the bag.

                    CLAUDE
          See you soon.

                    MARGOT
          Bye, sweety.

                    CLAUDE
          Say, you'll see me "soon."

                    MARGOT
          You're acting like a baby.

She backs away --

                    CLAUDE
          Don't see Dick.

                    MARGOT
          Don't worry. I don't think he
          wants to see me anyway.
                    CLAUDE
          Please, Margot. Promise me.
                    MARGOT
              (hesitates)
          Don't call me that.

Claude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths
"Go". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated
and anxious approaches the vehicle.

                                                               107.


81   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                        81

     Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat.    He
     puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.

     Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her
     ear and shakes her head.

     The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the
     pavement. She starts walking.

     The bus hisses and lurches forward.    Claude strains to see:

     Margot looks back.

     The bus groans as it picks up speed.   Margot sprints.

                          MARGOT
               Wait!

     She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.

                          MARGOT
               Wait!   Wait!

     She pants, breathless.

     The bus brakes.

     She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits.
     Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and
     panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.

                         MARGOT
                   (almost euphoric)
               Did you see me running out there?

                          CLAUDE
               Yeah.
     Margot cranes her neck to see outside.

                         MARGOT
               Good. That was a lot of running.
               I'm out of breath.
     Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.

          EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
          several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
          between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
          valley.
                         
          TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
          overgrown paddock.
                         
          THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.
                         
          TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.
                         
          TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.
                         
          FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
          front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
          others knit a large blanket.
                         
          TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.
                         
          A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.
                         
          A MAN chops wood.
                         
          A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A large room with unfinished wood walls has several
          blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.
                         
          TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.
                         
          MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
          appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered
          face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING
                         
          The men sit around a table eating dinner.
                         
          One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.
          Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is
          WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy
          beard.

          The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
          men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
          outside.
                         
          The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
          dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
          new serving of food.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The women sit around the table eating very small portions
          of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.

          The kitchen is filled with dishes.
                         
          TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
          crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
          crib.
                         
          People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
          a figure passes quickly through frame.
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
          the driveway. She carries a small bag.
                         
          Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
          see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
          watching.
                         
          Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
          woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
          to run.
                         
          SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.
                         
          Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
          yells out: "MARCY MAY"
                         
          The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
          For a moment everything is quiet.
           3.
                         
                         
          Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into
          the woods, chasing after Martha.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
          hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
          and two women are chasing her.
                         
          Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
          running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
                         
          Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
          the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
          begin their descent.
                         
          Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
          pass by.
                         
                         
          EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY
                         
          Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
          She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
          from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hello. Hello?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Hi!
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           Oh my god! Where are you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm not sure. Upstate I think.
                         
                          LUCY
           You're in New York?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I think. Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           When did you get back?
           4.
                         
                         
                         
          Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know. I should go back.
                         
                          LUCY
           Go back where?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I have to go, I can't stay gone.
                         
                          LUCY
           No, no, no. Don't go. What are you
           talking about?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sorry for calling.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not
           hang up.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you want me to come get you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I can't wait that long.
                         
                          LUCY
           What do you mean? Tell me where you are
           and I'll come right now.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's okay, you don't have to-
                         
                          LUCY
           I want to see you Martha. Please.
                         
          Martha thinks for a moment.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Martha!
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - DAY
                         
          Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled
          cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food
          like she hasn't eaten in days.
           5.
                         
                         
                         
          The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
          cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They
          are seated. Martha returns to eating.
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           Marcy May?
                         
          It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.
                         
                          WATTS
           What are you doin'?
                         
          Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits
          across from her.
                         
          Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
          them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           We were worried about you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm fine.
                         
                          WATTS
           Patrick's worried about you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I just wanted to come into town.
                         
                          WATTS
           I could've brought you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I wanted to walk.
                         
                          WATTS
           Through the woods?
                         
                          WAITRESS
                          (TO WATTS)
           Can I get you something?
                         
                          WATTS
           No.
                         
                          WAITRESS
                          (TO MARTHA)
           You done?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
           6.
                         
                         
                         
          The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his
          hand out to stop her.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (TO MARTHA)
           You not gonna eat that?
                         
          Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs
          it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate.
                         
          Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his
          hands and mouth while he chews.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           You ready to go?
                         
          Martha doesn't respond.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Come on!
                         
                          MARTHA
           Not right now.
                         
                          WATTS
           No?
                         
          The waitress drops the check on the table.
                         
          Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
          into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
          sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
          the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
          hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           I'll get this.
                         
          He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
          table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
          eye contact with her.
                         
          Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
          around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
          make a scene in front of all these people.
                         
          He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
          kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
          she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
                         
          Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
          turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly
          cuts through the kitchen.
           7.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
                         
          Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at
          an empty bus stop. She does not look well. She turns and
          vomits behind the bench.
                         
                         
          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
                         
          Martha hides between two parked buses. She watches a
          BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed
          woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. Martha
          walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.
                         
                         
          INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against
          the window watching the road behind her in the side view
          mirror.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's nice to see you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You too.
                         
          Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised.
                         
                          LUCY
           What's going on?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Not much.
                         
                          LUCY
           You alright?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           You sure?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           You were pretty upset on the phone.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sorry. I over reacted.
           8.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           To what?
                         
          Martha thinks.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What happened?
                         
                          MARTHA
           We had a fight.
                         
                          LUCY
           Who?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Me and this guy.
                         
                          LUCY
           Who?
                         
          Martha doesn't answer.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Your boyfriend?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Did he hurt you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No!
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you sure?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No. I'm fine.
                         
          Lucy is skeptical.
                         
                          LUCY
           Did you guys break up?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           How long were you together?
                         
                          MARTHA
           A while.

           How long?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or
           less.
                         
                          LUCY
           And you were here the whole time?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           You've been back in New York for over a
           year and you haven't called me?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm.
                         
                          LUCY
           Well, I'm glad you're here now.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - EVENING
                         
          Lucy makes the bed. Martha enters the room wrapped in a
          towel. Her hair drips on the floor.
                         
                          LUCY
           I made you some tea.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Thanks.
                         
          Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair.
                         
                          LUCY
           Ted should be up from the city soon.
           He'll cook us some dinner.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go
           to bed?
                         
                          LUCY
           Of course.

          Lucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her
          wet towel.

          Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE.
          The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters.
          He speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT. He sets down his bag and
          gives her a hug and a kiss.
                         
                          TED
           Well?
                         
                          LUCY
           She seems okay.

           What did she say?
                         
                          LUCY
           Not much, she's pretty tired.

                          LUCY
           She had some boyfriend, they were living
           in the Catskills.
                         
                          TED

                          LUCY
           It's okay.
                         
                          TED
           Not really Lucy.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's fine. She's here now.
                         
          Ted keeps his comments to himself.

           I told you she was fine. You spend all
           that time worrying.
                         
          Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor
          cabinet and pours a scotch.

          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The house is completely dark. Martha finds her way
          through the hallway and into the kitchen. She drinks
          water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst.
                         
          The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright
          spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is
          beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces
          herself to slowly turn and look. She puts her head down
          and quickly returns to her room.

          Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha? Why are you on the floor?
                         
          Martha does not know where she is. A moment passes before
          she starts to come to.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come
           have some breakfast.

          Lucy and Ted eat at the kitchen table. Martha enters.

           Yeah.

           How do you like the house?
                         
                          TED
           It's just a rental.

           Well I love it.
                         
          Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's nice. I didn't know there was a
           lake.
                         
                          LUCY
           Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
                         
                          MARTHA
           You don't live in the city anymore?
                         
                          LUCY
           We do. This is for weekends and holidays.
                         
          Ted and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Ted's finishing a new building down town
           and when it's done we're taking one of
           the new apartments. You want to see
           pictures?
                         
          Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room.
          Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice.

          Lucy re-enters with her digital camera.
                         
                          LUCY
           This is the view, the interiors are

           Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
                         
          Lucy notices that Martha isn't eating.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)

           It's okay, I can fix you something later.
                         
          Martha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite.

          Martha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the
          lake. Ted naps while Lucy sun bathes reading THE MOTHER

          Lucy is confused. She tries to make sense of the
          question.

           Just wondered.
                         
          Lucy goes back to reading. Martha lies down and stares at
          the sky. A light banging sound starts to echo over the
          lake.

          Patrick and two men build a fence.

          Martha is younger, more energetic and confident. They are
          laughing and talking when Zoe notices Patrick walking
          towards them.
                         
                          ZOE

           Just do it.
                         
          They put out their cigarettes. Zoe buries them in the
          grass. Patrick approaches them.

           Is this Martha?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Hi!
                         
                          PATRICK
           How're you doing?
                         
          Patrick crouches down over Zoe but smiles at Martha.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Great. You've got a really nice place
           here.
                         
                          PATRICK
           It's as much yours as it is mine.
                         
          He glances at her legs, then back up to her face. He
          turns his attention to Zoe.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           I thought you quit?
                         
                          ZOE
           I did.
                         
                          PATRICK
           It's disgusting.
                         
                          ZOE
           I know. I'm sorry.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Don't apologize to me, it's your body.
                         
          Patrick gestures towards Martha.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           Look after this girl properly Zoe, she
           deserves some real care for once in her
           life.
                         
                          ZOE
           I will.
                         
                          MARTHA
           She's been great, everyone's been great.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Good.

                          MARTHA
           Marcy was my grandmothers name.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Well, there you go.
                         
          He continues to walk through the field. Zoe and Martha
          recline into the grass and continue talking.
                         
           TED (O.S.)
           I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sure.
                         
          Martha stands up and brushes herself off.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           You coming?
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha turns to Zoe but Lucy is there instead, lying on
          the sun bed, lost in her book. Lucy does not answer.
                         
          Ted runs down the dock and dives into the water. Martha
          follows. Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of
          the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked.
                         
          Martha swims, lost in her own world.
                         
          Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the
          end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out.
                         
                          TED

           Brilliant choice of swim wear.
                         
          Lucy is not amused. Ted walks away laughing. He turns to
          sneak one more glimpse of Martha.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha! What are you doing?
                         
                          MARTHA
           What?
                         
                          LUCY
           Would you put some clothes on, you can't
           swim naked.

                          MARTHA
           Why?
                         
                          LUCY
           You just can't. There are kids around and
           people come by.
                         
                          MARTHA
           So?
                         
                          LUCY
           So you can't. We don't, just don't. I
           have a bathing suit you can borrow.
                         
          Martha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around
          her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels
          embarrassed.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
                         
          Martha sleeps. Lucy notices the bruising on Martha's ear.
                         
                          LUCY

           I've been trying to wake you. You should
           get up or you won't sleep through the
           night.
                         
          Martha wakes up.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           You should eat.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I will. I'm just going to sleep a little
           more first okay?
                         
                          LUCY
           Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you
           before.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's okay.
                         
          Lucy leaves. Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta
          outside then goes back to sleep.

          away.
                         
          MAX, A young man in his early twenties, comes outside and
          sits down next to her. Max is warm, nice, and care free.
          He's not very bright but he is a good time to be around.

           It's okay, you'll find your role. It
           takes time for people to find their role
           in a new family.
                         
          Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around.

           We sell blankets in town. We still need

           Hopefully by the end of the summer but
           we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and
           live stock without cash.

                          MARTHA
           I do. Thanks.
                         
                          PATRICK
           People have abandoned you your whole
           life. I don't blame you for not trusting
           anyone.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What?
                         
                          PATRICK
           If you ever want to have a meaningful
           relationship, you need to let your guard
           down.
                         
          Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           It's not your fault, but it's there. If
           you feel safe here, and I think you do,
           let us in. We just want to help you.
                         
                          ZOE
           Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.
                         
                          PATRICK
           If you're going to live here then really
           be apart of things.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Lucy is putting away groceries. Martha enters.
                         
                          LUCY
           Good morning. How are you feeling today?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Good.
                         
                          LUCY
           There's this great juice shop in town, I
           got us a couple of juices.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives
           me energy, so I thought it might help
           you.
                         
           Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           I got pineapple orange too if that's
           better.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
                         
                          LUCY
           I also got a box of these protein bars
           just in case you want to snack.
                         
          Martha watches Lucy put the groceries away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Why is the house so big?
                         
                          LUCY
           It's not that big.
                         
                          MARTHA
           For two people, it's huge.
                         
                          LUCY
           We like to entertain. Our friends
           come up for weekends and sometimes
           we have parties. It's just good to
           have space.
                         
                          MARTHA
           So no one else lives here?
                         
                          LUCY
           Of course no one else lives here.

           It is hot, sunny, and peaceful. Martha sits cross legged.
           Ted reads the newspaper. Lucy sunbathes. Martha notices
           they wear wedding rings.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (SURPRISED)
           You're married?

                          LUCY
           Earlier this year, in the spring.
                         
          There is an awkward silence.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           I tried to get in touch with you,
           apparently you got rid of your cell
           phone?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I lost it.
                         
                          LUCY
           You never got a new one?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I got used to not having it.
                         
                          TED
           Cocktail anyone?
                         
                          LUCY
           No thanks.

           Martha?
                         
          Martha shakes her head. Ted walks to the back of the
          boat. Martha has to stand up to let him pass through the
          narrow walk way. He brushes up against her as he squeezes
          by.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Was it a big wedding?
                         
                          LUCY
           No, about forty people. Mostly his
           family.

                          LUCY
           Yeah.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Did she smoke like chimney and complain
           about everything.
           24.
                         
                         
                         
          Ted laughs.
                         
                          LUCY
           She's not that bad.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You never had to live with her.

           You lived with Dora?
                         
                          MARTHA
           She lived with me after mom died.

           College.
                         
          Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're
           okay.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (SMILING)
           She hates me.
                         
                          LUCY
           She doesn't hate you.

           I hate her.
                         
          Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away.
                         
                          LUCY
           Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.
                          (LUCY FOCUSES)
           Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.
                         
          Martha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           There you go!
                         
          Lucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Don't shake it, that's a myth.
                         
          Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the
          Polaroid.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Is it true married people don't fuck?
                         
                          LUCY
           What? No!
                         
          Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at
          Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She
          stares at the Polaroid.

          Martha sits on the bed watching Lucy go through her
          closet looking at old clothes. Lucy holds up a summer
          dress.
                         
                          LUCY
           Put this on.
                         
                          MARTHA

           Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just
           try it.

                          LUCY
           It just feels good to put on something
           nice and comfortable.
                         
          Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)

          lost deep in thought.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. FARM/DARK ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          MARTHA SLOWLY WAKES UP. SHE IS LYING ON HER STOMACH ON
          COLD CEMENT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CANDLES ON THE FLOOR.
          SHE IS DISORIENTED AND FEELS SOMEONE ON TOP OF HER. SHE
          TURNS BACK TO LOOK BUT IT'S HARD TO MOVE. SHE CATCHES A
          GLIMPSE OF PATRICK, LEANING OVER HER DRIPPING SWEAT. 
          PATRICK IS AGGRESSIVELY HAVING SEX WITH HER FROM BEHIND.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE/SMALL DARK ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Martha seems like she has been drugged, she has a white
          robe draped around her. Katie consoles her and makes her
          drink water.
                         
                          KATIE
           I know you feel like something bad just
           happened Marcy May, but you have to trust
           me, that was not bad, it was truly good.
           We've all been in this situation, and we
           wouldn't all still be here if what
           happened in that room was bad. We all
           love each other very much, we are all
           together on this, you have to trust us.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you believe me?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE/ BEDROOM - LATER
                         
          Zoe and Martha share a single mattress on the floor in a
          small dark room. Martha is still wrapped in the robe, she
          is still dazed.
           28.
                         
                         
                         
                          ZOE
           You're so lucky, I'd give anything to
           have my first time again.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Really?
                         
                          ZOE
           Yeah, it's so special.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I can't remember anything, I just woke up
           on the floor and felt this pain -
                         
                          ZOE
           That's the cleansing. It's good. It means
           it's working if you can't remember
           things. You're cleansing yourself of the
           past and the toxins.
                         
           Martha is distant.
                         
                          ZOE (CONT'D)
           You need to share yourself, don't be so
           selfish.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm not.
                         
                          ZOE
           So smile then, enjoy this amazing night.
           It only happens once.
                         
           Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They
           curl up together in a very intimate way.
                         
           Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is
           caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on
           the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.
                         
                         
           EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          The group sits around listening to Max finish playing a
          song. Everyone claps for him. Patrick, who sits in the back,
          stands up and walks up to the stage. Everyone gets excited.
                         
           He tunes his guitar.
                         
                          PATRICK
           This one's called Marcy's song.
           29.
                         
                         
                         
          Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around
          to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play.
                         
          The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song.
          The whole group is entranced. Martha is mesmerized by
          him.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           Well she, she's just a picture.
           Who lives on my wall
           Well she, she's just a picture
           And the reason, reason, reason it is so
           small.
           With a smile so inviting and a body so
           tall, She, she's just a picture
           Just a picture
                          THAT'S ALL
                         
           Well you stand there, stand there with
           the nightshade,
           Her dripping ripping down your hands
           And you ask me, ask me about the
                          LIGHTNING
           And the lady, lady, lady she understands
           It's a dream for the future and the water
           for the sands
           And the strangeness is wandering Through
           many callin' lands
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Ted walks into the kitchen.
                         
          Martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen
          floor.
                         
          Ted gets a six pack out of the fridge. He cracks a beer
          and drinks it.
                         
                          TED
           What are you doing?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Cleaning.

           Alright. I'm going to take the boat out,
           do you want to come?
           30.

           She had to run to the city.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Oh.
                         
                          TED
           I'll teach you how to drive the boat,
           come on.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's okay.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY
                         
          Ted drives the boat with a beer in his hand. He moves
          over and motions for Martha to take the wheel. Ted slowly
          lets go and moves over so she can take the helm. They
          brush up against each other. Martha is driving the boat.
          She bounces up and down like an excited little girl.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOAT - LATER
                         
          Martha and Ted sit on the back of the boat. Ted gets a
          beer out of the cooler.
                         
                          TED
           You want one?
                         
          Ted hands her a beer. She stares at the beer and
          hesitates before taking a giant chug.

           I don't know, it's normal I guess. She
           hasn't changed much.
                         
          Martha takes a swig of her beer.

                          MARTHA
           I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
                         
                          TED
           Well, she did.
                         
          There is another awkward silence. They both drink their

           You don't need to ask.
                         
          Martha takes off her clothes. She is wearing a bikini
          that Lucy gave her. It does not quite fit. The bathing
          suit sags and top of her ass shows. Ted tries not to 
          look.
                         
          THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER AS SHE DIVES UNDER WATER.

          Watts swims by and guides her out of the water.
                         
          Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a
          rock face.

           Sure you can.
                         
          Watts jumps. Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff
          naked.
                         
          Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. She builds up
          the courage and jumps.
                         
           She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills
           with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She
           continues to swim, the camera follows her under water.
           The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.
                         
                         
           INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           The hallway is dark, the space is unclear. Martha walks
           down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. She
           walks into Patrick's room. She get's into bed with him
           and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. She looks safe
           and happy. He welcomes her, the room looks warm and
           comforting.

          Martha sleeps. THUMP. Something hits the roof. Martha
          wakes up. THUMP, ROLL. Martha sits up and listens. She
          waits in anticipation. THUMP.
                         
                         
          INT. LUCY AND TED'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha walks down the dark hallway and slowly opens the
          door to Ted and Lucy's room.
                         
          Ted and Lucy are having sex. Martha watches for a moment,
          then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the
          edge of the bed.
                         
          Lucy does not see Martha. Ted does not say anything, he
          continues to have sex with Lucy. His motion becomes
          harder, Lucy opens her eyes and Ted jumps up.
                         
                          LUCY

          Ted gestures to Martha.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Martha, what are you doing?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Nothing!
                         
          Ted turns on the light. He sits on the edge of the bed.
                         
                          LUCY
           Jesus, you can't just come in like that.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sorry.
                         
          Martha gets up to leave.
                         
                          LUCY
           God damn it, what's wrong?
                         
          Martha stops and stands facing the door.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's been hard to sleep alone.

          Martha goes to leave again.
                         
                          LUCY
                          (TO MARTHA)
           Stay, just stay.
                         
          Martha comes back and sits on the bed.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
                          (UPSET)
           Why would you think it was okay to come
           in like that?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys
           were on the other side.
                         
                          LUCY
           You can't come into our room when we're
           having sex, that's not normal! It's 
           private.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sorry.
                         
                          LUCY
           Don't apologize, I just want you to
           understand why it's not okay.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Okay.
                         
                          LUCY
           Do you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           Well?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Because it's privte and it's not normal.
                         
          Lucy can see something is really wrong.
                         
                          LUCY
           Just lie down Martha.
                         
          Martha lies in Lucy's lap. Lucy is uncomfortable with the
          contact, she pushes Martha's head onto a pillow.

          Ted stands up and puts on his sweatpants and walks out.
          Martha closes her eyes.

          Martha wakes up in Patrick's room, he is gently having
          sex with her. She doesn't enjoy it but she doesn't stop

           You should handle her.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You think?

          Martha sits in the passenger seat, Lucy drives. 
                         
          Martha notices a BROWN CAR is parked at the top of the 
          driveway on the side of the road. Martha is troubled by 
          the parked car's presence. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Whose car was that? 
           40.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY 
           I don't know. Why? 
                         
                          MARTHA
           Just curious.
                         
                          LUCY
           There's a hiking trail, people leave 
           their cars there all the time. 
                         
                         
          INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
                         
          Lucy looks through produce. Martha takes the cart and
          runs down the isle with it. She picks her feet off the
          ground so she is riding on the cart. Lucy is amused.
                         
          Martha turns around and goes faster, flying all the way
          down the isle. A good looking YOUNG MAN walks into the
          isle. Martha almost hits him with the cart but she slams
          her feet on the floor and just misses him. Lucy runs up
          and takes the shopping cart back. Martha doesn't say
          anything, she just stares at him.
                         
                          LUCY
           Sorry.
                         
                          YOUNG MAN
           It's okay.
                         
          The young man walks down the isle. Martha watches him go.
                         
                          LUCY
           You're going to hurt someone.
                         
          Martha is distracted.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Can you go get me a large jug of water.

           What's wrong with the tap?
                         
                          LUCY
           I like bottled.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's a waste.

          Martha walks through the refrigerated section looking for
          water. She notices the Young Man walking behind her. She
          stops to get water.
                         
          He stops to buy beer. He looks at her. She grabs the
          water and walks away.

           No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess 
           he'd rather pay for it than think I'm 
           sucking dick for it.

           I have, but I don't. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           Good, we don't drink. It just makes you 
           angry and less focused. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't 
           talk to our old families. 
                         
                          SARAH 
           I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter 
           how much he paid me. 
                         
          Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Hey. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet? 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Sally, yeah.

          INT. FARM KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Katie teaches Martha how to make a vegetable drink.
          Martha adds some herbs.
                         
                          KATIE
           That's enough.
                         
          Katie hands her a large chalky white pill.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Half is fine.
                         
          Martha breaks the tablet in half and drops it into the
          drink. She crushes it with a spoon.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Martha is back at the Lake house. Lucy enters and begins
          to load the dishwasher. Martha holds the glass with the
          green drink which we now see is just water.
                         
                          LUCY
           I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't mind.
                         
                          LUCY
           Get some sleep.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Okay.
                         
          Martha leaves. Holding the glass tightly, Martha walks to
          her bedroom.
                         
          IN ONE LONG TAKE, WHILE WALKING FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE
          BEDROOM, THE GLASS OF WATER HAS CHANGED BACK TO THE GREEN
          DRINK MARTHA PREPARED WITH KATIE.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM/SMALL DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha enters her bedroom holding the green drink.
                         
          Sarah sits in a chair wearing a WHITE ROBE. The room is
          no longer Martha's bedroom at the lake, it is a small
          dark room at the farm.
           47.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           Oh, hi.
                         
                          SARAH
           Hi.
                         
          Sarah is nervous. Martha brushes Sarah's hair.
                         
                          SARAH (CONT'D)
           What do I have to do?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it
           will help you relax.
                         
          Sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink. She gags.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           It's herbal. It's the start of your
           cleansing.
                         
          Martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           We've all done it so you know there's
           nothing to worry about.
                         
                          SARAH
           Do I have to wear this robe?
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (WHISPERING)
           I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a
           part of it.
                         
          Sarah looks very uncomfortable. She is getting light
          headed from the drink.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           You look amazing. It's your special night
           with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.
                         
                          SARAH
           Thanks.
                         
          Martha helps Sarah up and passes her through a door to
          the next room. She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on
          the ground. Martha shuts the door locking her in.
                         
          Martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball.
           48.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. MARTHA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Martha wakes up wearing Lucy's dress. She has wet
          herself.
                         
          Martha takes off the dress and stuffs it between the
          mattress and the box spring.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
                         
          Martha sits alone on the steps looking out onto the
          water. She is deep in thought. Lucy walks down the stairs
          and sits next to her.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Shouldn't we start cooking?
                         
                          LUCY
           I just made some potato salad. Ted's
           cooking the fish.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I thought we were going to cook.
                         
                          LUCY
           We cooked last night.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Oh, yeah.
                         
          Martha is lost deep in thought.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           Do you ever have this thing where you
           can't tell if something's a memory or if
           it's something you've dreamed?
                         
                          LUCY
           Not really.
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Do you blame me for anything?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No.

          I don't know.
                          (BEAT)
          I'm just trying to figure out why we
          stopped talking.
                         
                          MARTHA
          I didn't think about it.
                         
                          LUCY
          Really?
                         
                          MARTHA
          We were far apart.
                         
                          LUCY
          Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have
          taken better care of you.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (MUMBLES)
          The past doesn't matter.
                         
                          LUCY
          It does matter.
                         
                          MARTHA
          I took care of myself.
                         
                          LUCY
          I know you did. I think I could have done
          more though.
                         
                          MARTHA
          Stop it.
                         
                          LUCY
          Be honest with me, you never think about
          it?
                         
                          MARTHA
          No.
                         
                          LUCY
          You're not angry at me?
                         
                          MARTHA
          I know you don't think much of me but I
          knew what I was doing then and I still
          do.
           50.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm 
           just wondering if I should have come back 
           and kept you in school and helped you go 
           to college, you had so much potential.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't need your guidance, I never did. 
           I'm a teacher and a leader, you just
           never let me be that but now I know I am,
           I know who I am.
                         
                          LUCY
           Teacher and a leader? What are you
           talking about? I always encouraged you to 
           do more, but you shut me out.
                         
          Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought.

           work that way.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You can do that if you want to.

                          MARTHA
                          (CAUTIOUSLY)
           It's not your fault but you learned that
           success is measured by money and
           possessions. It's just not the right way
           to live.

          Lucy is floored by Martha's response.
                         
                          TED
           And what do you think the right way to
           live is? Being a hysterical mess and
           causing your family pain. You're eating
           my food and sleeping under my roof so
           watch your mouth. You're rude.
                         
          Martha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands
          up to Ted.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You don't know anything about it.
                         
          Ted and Lucy are speechless. Martha leaves.

          Martha sneaks downstairs in the middle of the night. Ted
          and Lucy are asleep in their room. Martha picks up the
          phone and dials a number. A WOMAN picks up.
                         
                          WOMAN

          Martha hangs up. The phone rings. She unplugs the phone
          and collapses on the floor.

          Martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing.
          Martha looks out into the feild to see Patrick talking
          with Sarah. She is enamoured by him.
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY 
                         
          Zoe, Martha, Sarah and MAX are shooting bottles in the 
          woods. 
                         
                          MAX 
           Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how 
           to defend yourselves but I think you're 
           hopeless. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows 
           how to load it. 
                         
                          MAX 
           Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday. 
                         
          Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe, 
          wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her 
          breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on. 
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D) 
           God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes 
           my willy hard. 
                         
          Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several 
          shots. He misses the bottles. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           What happened Doc? I should be teaching 
           you. 
                         
          He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Alright, my turn. 
                         
          Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping 
          the gun. 
           54.
                         
                         
                         
                          ZOE 
                          (PLAYFUL) 
           Alright Max, was this just an excuse to 
           grope Marcy. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'm teaching her how to shoot. 
           Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze. 
                         
          Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha 
          fires a few shots and misses. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about 
           someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel 
           how they made you feel in your stomach. 
           Take a deep breath, feel it all moving 
           out into your hands. Let it build. It's 
           transferring to the gun, building in the 
           gun. Now release. 
                         
          She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A 
          smile grows on martha's face. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
                          (SMILING) 
           Feels good right? 
                         
          Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           Now try that. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           What do you mean? 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Shoot it. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           They're living animals. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           So, shoot Max then. 
                         
          Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at 
          Max. Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           Go on! 
                         
          Max is confused, he gets embarrassed. 
           55.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX 
           Fuck this. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Don't walk away from me Max. 
                         
          Max stops. Martha drops the gun down to her waist. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           The cat has terminal cancer, it's in 
           excruciating pain. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           I can't. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Max has no substance, he's just here to 
           free load and be around the girls but 
           you're a teacher and leader, you just 
           don't see it because no one let you 
           believe it before me. You're a leader a 
           Marcy, now prove it. 
                         
          Martha is shook up. She does not fire the gun. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing 
           you think you used to love. You're 
           holding on to some false emotion that 
           stops you from doing what's right. 
                         
          Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand. The gun goes off. 
          Martha and Max jump. Zoe shot the cat without blinking. 
          She hands the gun back to Martha. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           I could spend my life being selfish, 
           living alone, using this gift for me but 
           I've sacrificed myself to be what you all 
           need me to be. You need to trust me. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           I trust you. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Then you shouldn't need me to explain 
           everything. 
                         
          A gun shot goes off. They all look up. Max looks 
          mortified, he has shot the other cat. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           What did you do? 
           56.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX 
           You said it was sick. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one 
           it was! 
                         
          Max tosses the gun and walks away. 
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HAY LOFT - NIGHT 
                         
          Martha looks for Max. She finds him in the hay loft. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You okay? 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'm fine. 
                          (BEAT) 
           I'll probably leave this place soon 
           anyways. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Where are you going to go? 
                         
                          MAX 
           I got places. My cousin lives in 
           Bennington, he said I could go up there 
           and make like, $500 a week selling weed. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You don't want to do that. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all 
           these rules. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Max, they're not rules. It's just common 
           sense. 
                         
                          MAX 
           It feels like rules. They won't let me do 
           anything. I can't even go on the house 
           runs. I'd be great at taking shit. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           It's not about taking shit. 
                         
                          MAX 
           Sounds like it's about taking shit to me. 
           57.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA 
           And that's why you don't get to come. 
           You just don't get it. 
                          (BEAT) 
           You need to quit drinking. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'm not drinking. 
                         
          Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You're still living with all the shit you 
           carried out there. You're the only one, 
           let it go. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'll try. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           No. You can't try. You have to stop. They 
           love you, they just want you to be 
           stronger. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'm strong, they'll see. 
                         
          Max leans up and tries to kiss her. Martha stops him. She 
          hugs him instead. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You'll be okay. 
                         
                         
          EXT. LARGE EXPENSIVE COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A rock is hurled onto the roof of the house. THUMP. It
          rolls down and off into the yard. Flood lights shine up
          at a beautiful large country home.
                         
          THREE PEOPLE run through the yard, dashing through the
          light and back into the shadows.
                         
          It is Martha, Watts, and Zoe, hurls another rock onto the
          roof.
                         
          A man inside comes to the window.
                         
          Zoe picks up a rock and throws it onto the roof. The man
          in the window walks towards his front door. Watts leads
          Martha towards the house.
           58.
                         
                         
                         
          The man in the house comes out of his front door, walks
          around the side of his house and looks up to see what's
          hitting the roof. He leaves the front door open. Watts
          and Martha creep into the house.
                         
                         
          INT. EXPENSIVE COUNTRY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha and Watts walk through the house. They sneak past
          a living room where a woman watches television.

          There are two place settings at the dinning room table
          and two candles burning in vintage, steel candle holders.
                         
          Watts blows out the candles, pours wax on the table and
          lays the candles down. He steals the candle holders.
                         
          There is a large painting on the wall. He motions for
          Martha to help him. They get on either side and dismount
          the painting, then lay it face up on the floor.
                         
          They hear the man come inside and talk to his wife. 
                         
          They continue to creep through the house, into the
          kitchen and out the back door.

          each in the same room.
                         
          Patrick walks down stairs and sits quietly in the corner
          watching them.

          Martha lies awake in her room. She hears a car outside. 
          She creeps to her window and peeks out. She can't see 
          what kind of car it is. It leaves the lights and engine 
          on for a moment, then it shuts off. No one gets out. She 
          is frozen with fear. She builds up courage then leaves
          her room.
           59.

          Martha walks through the dark lake house, looking out the
          windows trying to see if anyone is coming, almost as if
          she is standing guard. She is trembling with fear.
                         
          A dark figure crosses from one room to another behind
          her. She freezes, turns and holds her breath.
                         
          The man walks out of the room. Martha screams. It's Ted.

          Ted sits on one end of the couch, Martha on the other
          end. He wears his robe and drinks a beer. He glances over
          at Martha who is lost in the movie, laughing.

          Martha lies down. He offers her a pillow. She raises her
          head and he puts it under.

          on the couch next to Ted. The TV is on and there are
          three empty beer bottle on the table.
                         
          Lucy is furious. She picks up the bottles and walks into
          the kitchen, being sure to make as much noise as she can.
                         
          Ted and Martha wake up. Martha sits up on the couch and
          watches Ted walk into the kitchen.

          everywhere.
                         
          She picks up a loose shard of glass and scrapes a line on
          the side of the car. She drops the glass and stares at
          the mess for a moment before looking around to make sure
          no one has seen her.

           64.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's your name?
                         
                          BARTENDER
           Mike.
                         
          He puts out his hand to shake hers. She takes a half step
          back and studies his face.
                         
                          BARTENDER (CONT'D)
           Can I get you something?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I used to like this.
                         
          She points at the tequila.
                         
                          BARTENDER
           Straight?
                         
          She stands there looking dazed. She doesn't respond. He
          just pours it. He is confused by her.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I thought you weren't supposed to drink
           Mike.
                         
                          BARTENDER
           I'm not drinking.
                         
          He hands her the tequila. She suddenly slaps it out of
          his hand. The glass shatters on the ground.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You think you're so fucking smart.
                         
          Martha storms inside. Lucy follows her in.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hey, what happenind?
                         
                          MARTHA
           We all need to leave.
                         
                          LUCY
           What?
                         
                          MARTHA
           He's a fucking liar. We all need to
           leave.
                         
          She points to the bartender.
           65.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           What are you talking about?
                         
          Lucy lowers Martha's pointing hand and tries to move her
          away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           We have to leave. We all have to leave. I
           know him.
                         
                          LUCY
           Who?
                         
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck is wrong with you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           You don't want to live with this Lucy.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha.
                         
                          TED
           Calm down.
                         
          Ted approaches and helps guide Martha into their bedroom.
                         
          Lucy turns around to check the party. People are starting
          to notice. Lucy and Ted force Martha back into their
          bedroom. He closes the door.

           What are you talking about?
                         
                          MARTHA
           They're here.
                         
          Martha is frantic, she begins to hyperventilate.
                         
          Lucy tries to hug her, Martha squirms free. Lucy hugs her
          again and pulls her onto the bed, trying to get her to
          calm.
                         
                          LUCY
           Breath.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Don't touch me, you're not listening to
           me!
           66.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha please try to breath. I don't know
           what you're talking about.
                         
          Ted walks into the bathroom and gets pills. He forces
          them down and makes Martha drink water.
                         
          She calms down. She falls back onto the bed.
                         
          Ted and Lucy look exhausted.

          INT. LARGE EXPENSIVE COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Martha walks through a large house in the dark. She gets
          to the front door and opens it letting in Katie, Zoe,
          Watts and Patrick. They immediately scatter around the
          house, looking in cupboards. Suddenly the lights turn on.
                         
                          MAN
           What the fuck.
                         
                          WATTS
           Hey, we can go.
                         
          The man is confused.
                         
                          MAN
           What do you want?
                         
                          WATTS
           Nothing.
                         
          The man goes to pick up the phone to call the police.
          Watts stops, turns and get's in his face.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           No need for that, we are leaving.
                         
          Watts, Zoe and Martha walk to the front door.
                         
          Patrick appears behind the man.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Calm down, if you calm down no one will
           get hurt.
                         
                          MAN
           What do you want?
           67.
                         
                         
                         
                          PATRICK
           We're not stealing, we don't want
           anything.
                         
                          MAN
           Just get out.
                         
                          PATRICK
           We're just looking at the house. It's
           nice.
                          (BEAT)
           We didn't realize you were home. We
           wouldn't have come in otherwise.
                         
                          MAN
           Just Leave.
                         
                          PATRICK
           I would but I can't be sure you won't
           call the police.
                         
                          MAN
           I won't. You didn't take anything so just
           go, I just want my family to be safe.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless
           you call the police, everything will be
           fine.
                         
                          MAN
           Okay, I won't. You have my word, please
           just go.
                         
          Martha walk outside. Patrick just stands there, he won't
          leave. Katie and Zoe walk out of the other room and are
          standing behind the Man. They don't move. He feels
          surrounded.
                         
                          MAN (CONT'D)
           Get the fuck out of my house.
                         
          Martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door. No
          one knows what to do. The girls are looking to Patrick
          but he's not doing anything. Suddenly Katie lunges at the
          man and stabs him in the neck. Blood spurts out and she
          stabs him again in the ribs.
                         
          They all run out.

          INT. FARM BEDROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Martha is in a small wood paneled room lying on a
          mattress. She is stunned.
                         
          She looks through the open door to see Katie and Watts
          washing in the bathroom.
                         
          Patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with
          Martha. Martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Look at me.
                         
          Patrick runs his hands through her hair.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           You okay?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Uh huh.
                         
          There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay.
                         
                          PATRICK
           You know that death is the most beautiful
           part of life, right? Death is beautiful
           because everyone fears death. And fear is
           the greatest human emotion of all because
           it creates complete awareness. When
           you're scared it forces you to be
           completely aware of your surroundings and
           the moment you're in. It brings you to
           NOW and that makes you truly present. And
           when you are truly present, that's
           nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is
           pure love.

          Martha wakes up. Lucy is sitting on the bed. She has
          brought Tea. Martha sits up and takes a sip.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.
                         
          She smiles, lies down and curls up again. She is half
          asleep.

                          LUCY
           Everything was fine.

           Yes, you slept through the night.
                         
                          MARTHA
           That's good.

           I don't want it.

          EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          Men are moving vehicles into the garage. Women are
          bringing the clothes inside off the clothes line. Martha
          is helping with the garden. There is a sense of urgency 
          to close the farm.
                         
          Max is in the hayloft trying to close the loft door. He 
          slips and falls 30 feet to the ground. Martha rushes over 
          to him. He is in pain. Watts comes out of the barn. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           We have to do something.
                         
                          WATTS
           He's fine. Right Max? 
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, I'm cool.
                         
          They help him up and he falls. He cant put pressure on
          his leg and he seems to have a concussion. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           Watts!
           70.

           There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to
           get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine.

          Everyone is sleeping. Max is curled up in the corner.
          Martha walks over to him and wakes him. There is vomit in 
          the corner. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           Do you feel alright? If you hit your head 
           you shouldn't sleep. 
                         
                          MAX
           I'm fine.

           No. Do you?
                         
          She shakes her head.

           What do you think it was?

          Katie rings the dinner bell. Martha walks out of the
          house holding a large pot of soup. She walks it through
          the courtyard into the shed where everyone gathers to eat
          dinner.
                         
          Everyone from the farm stops work and walks towards the
          shed. It looks like more people are there than before,
          there are several new faces in the crowd.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Martha is cleaning the house. The phone rings, she picks
          it up. A young girl's voice is on the other end.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Hello?

           Who's this?
                         
          There is something written on the wall Martha reads. 
          Martha signals to a girl in the kitchen to go outside. 
                         
                          VOICE

           It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name
           Jane.
                         
                          VOICE

           number?
                         
          Martha writes JANE HELLER on a list of names on the wall.
          Some of them have been scratched out. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know, do you?
                         
          Watts comes inside.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           It's a Jane.
                         
                          WATTS
           Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do
           it, I'll be around there on Friday. No,
           that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll
           see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad
           you called.
                         
          Watts hangs up. He and Martha have a quiet exchange and
          Watts walks away.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)

          Martha sneaks a bite of bread. Katie whacks her in the
          ear with a wooden spoon. A slight ringing remains
          throughout the scene.
                         
                          KATIE
           Nothing till they're done. You know

          Martha is at the lake house cooking with Lucy.

                          LUCY
           Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish
           up.
                         
          Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes
          the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the
          couch in front of the television.
                         
          Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the
          couch.
                         
          He reaches out and holds her hand.

           We can arrange for her to be somewhere by
           Wednesday.

           I don't think she should stay with us
           anymore. We can't do anything for her
           when she's like this.
                         
          Lucy goes back to chopping.

                          ZOE
           I know. It happens though, we're never
           really dead or alive, we just exist, so
           he's still existing, but it's in a
           parallel time. Just don't think about it,
           it's in the past.

          Someone knocks at the door. She pretends not to be in

          the door and corners Martha and yells at her.

           Maybe I asked too much from you too soon.
           You have potential but you're just not
           there yet. I'll expect less of you fro
           now on.
                         
          Martha is upset, like a trained animal, she runs back to
          his side, sits next to him and rests her head on his
          shoulder.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
          He runs his hand through her hair.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Shhh. It's okay.
                         
          He puts his hand on the inside of her thigh.

          Martha wakes up on the couch confused, she sees a man
          standing over her. She quickly pushes him up, jumps over
          tyhe back of the couch and runs away.
                         
          The man is Ted. He follows her, trying to calm her down
          but she is in a blind state of panic.
                         
          She runs to the stairs. He follows her. She trips. He
          goes to see if she is okay. She kicks him. He falls down
          the stairs.
                         
          The lights turn on. Lucy comes out of the bedroom to see
          Ted at the bottom of the stairs. She rushes over to him.
                         
          Ted gets up slowly.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you alright?
                         
          Ted pushes Lucy off of him.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck happened?
                         
                          TED
           She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus
           Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.
                         
          Martha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is
          irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha.
                         
                          LUCY
           You could have killed him.
                         
          Martha backs away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I was confused.
                         
                          LUCY
           About what, what are you so confused
           about?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I thought he was someone else.
                         
          Lucy's anger is building.
           77.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           You thought he was someone else? What is
           wrong with you?
                          (BEAT)
           I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing
           this anymore. I beat myself up over you
           for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of
           chasing you down and worrying about you.
           I need to move on.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          LUCY
           You need help Martha.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I know.
                         
                          LUCY
           What happened to you?
                         
          Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her
          eyes.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What happened to you?
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (SCREAMING)
           I don't know.
                         
          Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is
          too far gone.
                         
                          LUCY
           We're going to get you proper help.
                         
          There is a long moment of silence.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Are you going to send me away?
                         
                          LUCY
           I don't know how to help you anymore.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (PLEADING)
           Please don't. Please don't.
                         
                          LUCY
           I can't help you.
           78.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           Please, I can't be alone, please.
                         
                          LUCY
           We're trying to start a family and I
           don't trust you to be here.
                         
          Lucy walks away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Lucy?
                         
                          LUCY
           What?
                         
          Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          MARTHA
           You're going to be a terrible mother.
                         
          Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into
          tears. There is a long, tense silence. Lucy dries her
          eyes.
                         
                          LUCY
           Do you have any money left?
                         
          Martha shakes her head.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Of course you don't.
                          (BEAT)
           We'll make sure everything is taken care
           of.
                         
          Lucy walks away, Martha is frozen on the stairs.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE - NEXT DAY
                         
          Martha walks through the house. All of the luggage is
          packed and sitting by the front door.
                         
          Ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a
          beer.
           79.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
                         
          It is an overcast, unusually cold Labor Day. Lucy works
          in the garden.
                         
                          LUCY
           Going swimming?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's a bit chilly.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't mind.
                         
                          LUCY
           I think we both said some things last
           night that we didn't mean.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           We scheduled an appointment for you
           tomorrow morning.
                         
          Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices
          footprints.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's it like there?
                         
                          LUCY
           It looks nice.
                         
          Martha turns and walks down to the water.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           We're heading back to the city in about
           an hour. You'll be ready to go?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yep.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY
                         
          Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her
          underwear and dives in.
           80.
                         
                         
                         
          Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water
          and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the
          surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.
                         
          Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for
          air.
                         
          She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice
          homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is
          swimming.
                         
          Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock,
          he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans
          are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt
          is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He
          looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.
                         
          He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water,
          puts on his shirt and just sits there.
                         
          Martha swims back to the house.
                         
                         
          INT. TED'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted
          drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway
          and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha 
          gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the 
          breaks. 
                         
                          TED 
           Jesus Christ. 
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
                         
          The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit
          him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into
          the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car
          drives behind Ted's car.
                         
          Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back
          again to see that he is still there.
           81.
                         
                         
          She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying
          something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in
          silence.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                                           1955

                

               NEW YORK CITY, 187TH STREET. A SUMMER DAY

               FADE IN:

               Just east of Webster Avenue in the North Bronx, 187th Street 
               is a predominantly Italian community and the commercial avenue 
               of the neighborhood. Fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, 
               butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish. 
               It is Saturday morning around eleven o'clock -- a market 
               day.

               WOMEN, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, 
               baby carriages. MERCHANTS at their improvised street stands, 
               hawking their wares, disputing with their CUSTOMERS, roaring 
               salutations to PASSERSBY.

               In the midst of all this, CAMERA HOMES IN on a typical 
               neighborhood...

               BUTCHER SHOP.

               Delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of 
               garlic. PATSY, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping 
               a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty-
               year-old MATRON. There are three or four other WOMEN in the 
               shop, all talking to one another. A four-year-old BOY lazily 
               chases a cat.

               The white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, 
               MARTY PILLETTI, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. Marty 
               is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty-four. 
               His charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. He 
               drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up 
               for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the 
               block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. He 
               sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts 
               as he chats with his customer, MRS. FUSARI.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         Your kid brother got married last 
                         Sunday, eh, Marty?

                                     MARTY
                              (sawing away)
                         That's right, Missus Fusari. It was 
                         a very nice affair.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         That's the big tall one, the fellow 
                         with the moustache.

                                     MARTY
                              (still sawing)
                         No, that's my other brother, Freddie. 
                         My other brother Freddie, he's been 
                         married four years already. He lives 
                         down on Webb Avenue. The one who got 
                         married Sunday, that was my little 
                         brother, Nickie.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         I thought he was a big tall fat 
                         fellow. Didn't I meet him here one 
                         time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried 
                         to sell me life insurance?

               Marty sets the five chops on the scale, watches its weight 
               register.

                                     MARTY
                         No, that's my sister Margaret's 
                         husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, 
                         she's married to the insurance 
                         salesman, and my sister Rose, she 
                         married a contractor. They moved to 
                         Detroit last year. And my other sister 
                         Frances, she got married about two 
                         and a half years ago in Saint John's 
                         Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, 
                         that was a big affair. Well, let's 
                         see now, that'll be about a dollar-
                         seventy-nine. How's that with you?

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         Well...

               Mrs. Fusari produces an old leather change purse from her 
               pocketbook and painfully extracts one single dollar bill and 
               seventy-nine cents to the penny and lays the money piece by 
               piece on the counter. From the rear of the shop a woman's 
               VOICE rings out.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hey, Marty, I'm inna hurry.

                                     MARTY
                         You're next right now, Missus Canduso.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         When you gonna get married, Marty? 
                         You should be ashamed of yourself. 
                         All your brothers and sisters, they 
                         all younger than you, they married 
                         and they got children. I just saw 
                         your mother inna fruit shop, and she 
                         says to me, "Hey, you know a nice 
                         girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter 
                         with you? That's no way. Now you get 
                         married.

                                     MARTY
                              (amiably)
                         Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over 
                         there, she's inna big hurry, and...

               Mrs. Fusari takes her parcel of meat, but apparently she 
               feels she still hasn't quite made her point.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         My son Frank, he was married when he 
                         was nineteen years old. Watsa matter 
                         with you?

                                     MARTY
                         That's swell, Missus Fusari.

                                     MRS. FUSARI
                         You should be ashamed of yourself.

               She takes her package of meat. Marty gathers up the money on 
               the counter, turns to the cash register behind him to ring 
               up the sale. Mrs. Canduso sidles up to the counter.

                                     MRS. CANDUSO
                         Marty, I want a nice, big fat pullet, 
                         about four pounds. I hear your kid 
                         brother got married last Sunday.

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah, it was a very nice affair.

                                     MRS. CANDUSO
                         Marty, you oughta be ashamed. All 
                         your kid brothers and sisters married 
                         and have children. When you gonna 
                         get married?

               NEIGHBORHOOD BAR. LATE AFTERNOON

               A TV set on the wall. Mel Allen, smoking a White Owl cigar, 
               is recapping the baseball game that has just finished as 
               Marty comes in.

                                     MARTY
                              (to two YOUNG MEN 
                              leaving)
                         What happened?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         The Yanks took two.

                                     MARTY
                         Any homers?

               The Young Men exit without answering. Marty moves further 
               into the bar, which is crowded with locals, smoky, noisy. 
               ACROSS GROUP at bar with Marty in the background approaching, 
               we see a group consisting of RALPH, who wears a suit and 
               tie, the only man in the room who isn't in shirtsleeves or a 
               Basque shirt; JOE, thirty-two, hunched over a girlie magazine; 
               a KID, twenty-two, studying the magazine over Joe's shoulder.

                                     MARTY
                              (to the Kid)
                         Angie come in yet?

               The Kid indicates a booth where a small wasp of a man, mid-
               thirties, is sitting, bent over the sports pages of the Daily 
               News.

                                     RALPH
                         So these two girls come over to the

                         You want a beer, Ang'?

                                     RALPH

                         Hiya, Ralph...

                         nurses, Marty...

                              (to Joe studying his 
                              magazine)
                         Waddaya read there, Joe?

                                     RALPH
                         Turns out these two girls are nurses 
                         in some hospital on a Hundred and 
                         Fourth Street...

                                     JOE
                         They shouldn't sell magazines like 
                         this on a public newsstand...

                                     MARTY
                         That's the truth.

                                     JOE
                              (turning a page)
                         Can you imagine the effect this has 
                         on adolescents?

                                     RALPH
                         So, Marty, let me tell you about 
                         these nurses...

                              Bartender)
                         What nurses?

                                     RALPH
                         The nurses Leo and me picked up last 
                         night. We got a date with them 
                         tonight.

                                     MARTY
                              (moving off to Angie's 
                              booth)
                         You still owe me ten bucks from last 
                         week, if that's what you're working 
                         up to.

               Joe turns another page in the girlie magazine.

                                     JOE
                         Now that's something, eh?

                                     RALPH
                         I used to go out with a girl like

                         You should live so long.

               THE BOOTH.

               Marty joins his friend Angie and pushes a bottle of beer at 
               him, pulling one of the pages loose from the paper Angie is 
               reading. For a moment, the two men sit quietly, each poring 
               over his separate piece of newspaper.

                                     ANGIE
                              (without looking up)
                         So waddaya feel like doing tonight?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel 
                         like doing?

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, we oughta do something. It's 
                         Saturday night. I don't wanna go 
                         bowling like last Saturday. How about 
                         calling up that big girl we picked 
                         up inna movies about a month ago in 
                         the RKO Chester?

                                     MARTY
                              (not very interested)
                         Which one was that?

                                     ANGIE
                         That big girl that was sitting in 
                         front of us with the skinny friend.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     ANGIE
                         We took them home alla way out in 
                         Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. 
                         What do you say? You think I oughta 
                         give her a ring? I'll take the skinny 
                         one.

                                     MARTY
                         She probably got a date by now, Angie.

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, let's call her up. What can we 
                         lose?

                                     MARTY
                         I didn't like her, Angie. I don't 
                         feel like calling her up.

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, what do you feel like doing 
                         tonight?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know. What do you feel like 
                         doing?

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, we're back to that, huh? I say 
                         to you, "What do you feel like doing 
                         tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't 
                         know, what do you feel like doing?" 
                         And then we wind up sitting around 
                         your house with a coupla cansa beer, 
                         watching Sid Caesar on television. 
                         Well, I tell you what I feel like 
                         doing. I feel like calling up this 
                         Mary Feeney. She likes you.

                                     MARTY
                         What makes you say that?

                                     ANGIE
                         I could see she likes you.

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah, sure.

                                     ANGIE
                              (half-rising in his 
                              seat)
                         I'll call her up.

                                     MARTY
                         You call her up for yourself, Angie. 
                         I don't feel like calling her up.

               Angie sits down again. They both return to their papers for 
               a moment. Then Angie looks up again.

                                     ANGIE
                         How about going downa Seventy-Second 
                         Street, see what we can find? Ralph 
                         says you have to beat them off with 
                         clubs.

               Marty makes a wry face at the suggestion.

                                     ANGIE
                         Boy, you're getting to be a real 
                         drag, you know that?

                                     MARTY
                         Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I 
                         been looking for a girl every Saturday 
                         night of my life. I'm tired of 
                         looking. Everybody's always telling 
                         me to get married. Get married. Get 
                         married. Don't you think I wanna get 
                         married? I wanna get married. They 
                         drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna 
                         wreck your Saturday night for you, 
                         Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you 
                         go ahead. I don't wanna go.

                                     ANGIE
                         My old lady, every word outta her 
                         mouth, when you gonna get married?

                                     MARTY
                         My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

               Angie leans back in his seat, scowls at the paper napkin 
               container on the booth table. Marty returns to the sports 
               page. For a moment, a silence hangs between them.

                                     ANGIE
                         So what do you feel like doing 
                         tonight?

                                     MARTY
                              (without looking up)
                         I don't know. What do you feel like 
                         doing?

                              to Angie)
                         Come on over about half past seven, 
                         we'll think of something.

                         Hello, Ma, what's the matter?

               PILLETTI HOME, LIVING ROOM.

               It's a typical lower-middle-class Italian home, and MRS. 
               PILLETTI is on the phone, a round, dark woman. Beyond her, 
               in the dining room, we can see a young couple -- THOMAS, 
               Marty's cousin, and his wife VIRGINIA, seated at the dining 
               room table.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (voice lowered)
                         Hello, Marty, when you coming home? 
                         Where you now? Because your cousin 
                         Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're 
                         here. They had another fight with 
                         your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...

               THE BAR.

                                     MARTY
                              (in the phone booth)
                         I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll 
                         be home in about two minutes. Tell 
                         Thomas stick around, I wanna see him 
                         about something.

               PILLETTI HOME, LIVING ROOM.

               Mrs. Pilletti is on the phone.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Okay, you come on home, okay.

               She hangs up, braces herself, turns and starts back to Thomas 
               and Virginia in the dining room.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         He coming home right now.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about 
                         the milk bottle was my mother-in-
                         law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt 
                         Theresa, and she begins poking her 
                         head over my shoulder here and poking 
                         her head over my shoulder there, so 
                         then she begins telling me how I 
                         waste money and how I can't cook, 
                         and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, 
                         so she got me so nervous, I spilled 
                         some milk I was making for the baby...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She was here, you know, Wednesday, 
                         and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."

                                     VIRGINIA
                         So she say, "You're spilling the 
                         milk." So she kept talking about 
                         these coupla drops of milk I spilled, 
                         so she got me so mad, so I said, 
                         "Mama, you wanna see me really spill 
                         some milk?" So I took the bottle, 
                         and I threw it against the door. I 
                         didn't throw it at her. That's just 
                         something she made up. She goes around 
                         telling everybody I threw the bottla 
                         milk at her. I didn't throw it 
                         anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry 
                         right away, you know, but she ran 
                         outta the house.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, I don't know what you want me 
                         to do, Virginia. If you want me, 
                         I'll go talk to her tonight.

               Thomas and Virginia suddenly frown and look down at their 
               hands as if of one mind.

                                     THOMAS
                         Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Lemme tell it, Tommy.

                                     THOMAS
                         Okay.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         We want you to do a very big favor 
                         for us, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Aunt Theresa, you got this big house 
                         here. I mean, you got this big house 
                         just for you and Marty. And I thought 
                         maybe Tommy's mother could come here 
                         and live with you and Marty.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Because I called up Tommy's brother 
                         Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving 
                         me crazy. Why don't you take her for 
                         a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh 
                         no!" I know I sound like a terrible 
                         woman...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         No, Virginia, I know how you feel.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         I just can't stand it any more! Every 
                         minute of the day! Do this! Do that! 
                         I don't have ten minutes privacy 
                         with my husband! We can't even have 
                         a fight! We don't have no privacy! 
                         Everybody's miserable in our house!

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, Ginnie, don't get so 
                         excited.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She's right. She's right. Young 
                         husband and wife, they should have 
                         their own home. And my sister 
                         Catherine, she's my sister, but I 
                         gotta admit, she's an old goat. And 
                         plenty-a times in my life, I feel 
                         like throwing the milk bottle at her 
                         myself. And I tell you now, as far 
                         as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa 
                         come live here with me and Marty, 
                         it's all right with me.

               Virginia promptly bursts into tears.

                                     THOMAS
                              (not far from tears 
                              himself, lowers his 
                              face)
                         That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         We gotta ask Marty, of course.

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (rises)
                         You just sit here, I gotta turn the 
                         fire on under the cooking.
                              (exits into the kitchen)

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (having mastered her 
                              tears)
                         That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.

                                     THOMAS
                              (calling to his aunt 
                              in the kitchen)
                         How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (off-screen)
                         Oh, he's fine. You know a nice girl 
                         he can marry?

               She comes back into the dining room, wiping her hands on a 
               kitchen towel.

                                     THOMAS
                         Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, 
                         Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (sitting down again)
                         Well, I don't know. He sits arounna 
                         house alla time. You know a place he 
                         can go where he can find a bride?

                                     THOMAS
                         Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. 
                         That's a kind of a big dance hall. 
                         Every Saturday night, it's just loaded 
                         with girls. It's a nice place to go. 
                         You pay seventy-seven cents. It used 
                         to be seventy-seven cents. It must 
                         be about a buck and half now. And 
                         you go in and you ask some girl to 
                         dance. That's how I met Virginia. 
                         Nice, respectable place to meet girls. 
                         You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you 
                         tell him, "Go to the Stardust 
                         Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (committing the line 
                              to memory)
                         The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded 
                         with tomatoes.

                                     THOMAS
                         Right.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         This is very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa, 
                         what you're doing for us, and don't 
                         think we don't appreciate...

               The SOUND of the DOOR BEING UNLATCHED in the kitchen can be 
               heard. Mrs. Pilletti promptly rises.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         He's here.

               She hurries into...

               THE KITCHEN.

               Marty comes into the kitchen from the rear porch.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ma.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (whispers)
                         Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. 
                         They had another fight with your 
                         Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would 
                         it be all right if Catherine come to 
                         live with us. So I said, all right 
                         with me, but we have to ask you. 
                         Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody 
                         wants her. Everybody's throwing her 
                         outta their house...

                                     MARTY
                         Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You gotta good heart.

               She turns and leads the way back into the dining room. Marty 
               follows.

               DINING ROOM.

               Thomas has risen. Mrs. Pilletti and Marty come in.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         He says okay, it's all right Catherine 
                         comes here.

                                     THOMAS
                         Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really 
                         takes a load offa my mind.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, we got plenny-a room here.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's 
                         gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight 
                         to your house, and I talk with 
                         Catherine, and you see, everything 
                         is gonna work out all right.

                                     THOMAS
                         I just wanna thank you people again, 
                         because the situation was just 
                         becoming impossible.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Siddown, Thomas, siddown.

               She exits into the kitchen. Virginia follows her to the 
               kitchen door, where the two women ad-lib the following lines 
               over the ensuing scene between Marty and Thomas.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         That's all right, that's all right...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         On accounta...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I'm gonna see you tonight...

               Over this, Thomas talks to Marty.

                                     THOMAS
                         Marty, I don't know how to tell you 
                         how much I appreciate what you and 
                         your mother are doing, because the 
                         kinda thing was happening in our 
                         house was Virginia was in the kitchen 
                         making some milk for the baby. So my 
                         mother comes in...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy, I promised the babysitter six 
                         o'clock.

                                     MARTY
                         Tommy, before you go, I wonder if 
                         you gimme a little advice.

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure, what?

                                     MARTY
                         You're the accountant inna family, 
                         and I figure you might know about 
                         these things. My boss wantsa sell 
                         his shop to me. His kids are all 
                         married, you know, and he and his 
                         wife live alone, and they wanna move 
                         out to California where his daughter 
                         lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. 
                         He wants five thousand dollars down, 
                         although I think I can knock him 
                         downa four...

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (off-screen, from 
                              deep in the kitchen)
                         Tommy!

                                     THOMAS
                              (rises)
                         I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll 
                         sit down and we'll discuss the whole 
                         thing.

                                     MARTY
                         All right, I'll see you, Thomas, 
                         because he wants an answer by Monday.

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. 
                         We'll work out some arrangement, 
                         because naturally I want to pay...

                                     MARTY
                         Don't worry about it.

                                     THOMAS
                         No, listen, that's my mother, I'm 
                         gonna pay for her...

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (off-screen)
                         Goodby, Marty!

                                     MARTY
                         Goodby, Virginia! See you soon!

               Thomas has moved off to join his wife in the kitchen where 
               we can hear them exchanging final protestations and goodbys 
               with Mrs. Pilletti. Marty sits at the table, hands folded in 
               front of him, stolid, pensive.

               THE KITCHEN. DUSK.

               Mrs. Pilletti bends over her steaming kettles. Through the 
               window we see evening is gathering.

               MARTY'S BEDROOM.

               It's a small room with bed, chest of drawers, religious 
               pictures, etc. Marty sits squatly on the edge of the bed, 
               absorbed in thought. He stands, moves out into...

               THE GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR.

               ...and down that into...

               THE DINING ROOM.

               ...now lit by the overhead neo-Tiffany lampshade and the 
               beaded old-fashioned lamps. He crosses to the kitchen door, 
               looks in on his mother, cooking away, turns, crosses back 
               to...

               THE LIVING ROOM.

               He closes the sliding doors that separate the living and 
               dining rooms. He extracts a small black address book from 
               his hip pocket, flips through it, finds the page he wants, 
               studies it intently.

               He sits on the chair by the phone, dials.

                                     MARTY
                              (with a vague pretense 
                              at good diction)
                         Hello, is this Mary Feeney?... Could 
                         I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?... Just 
                         tell her an old friend...

               He waits again. With his free hand he wipes the gathering 
               sweat on his brow.

                                     MARTY
                         ...Oh, hello there, is this Mary 
                         Feeney? Hello there, this is Marty 
                         Pilletti. I wonder if you recall 
                         me... Well, I'm kind of a stocky 
                         guy. The last time we met was in a 
                         movie, the RKO Chester. You was with 
                         another girl, and I was with a friend 
                         of mine named Angie. This was about 
                         a month ago...

               The girl apparently doesn't remember him. A sort of panic 
               begins to seize Marty. His voice rises a little.

                                     MARTY
                         The RKO Chester in Westchester Square. 
                         You was sitting in front of us, and 
                         we was annoying you, and you got 
                         mad, and... I'm the fellow who works 
                         in a butcher shop... Come on, you 
                         know who I am!... That's right, we 
                         went to Howard Johnson's and we had 
                         hamburgers. You hadda milkshake... 
                         Yeah, that's right. I'm the stocky 
                         one, the heavy-set feller... Well, 
                         I'm glad you recall me, because I 
                         hadda swell time that night, and I 
                         was just wondering how everything 
                         was with you. How's everything?... 
                         That's swell... Yeah, well, I'll 
                         tell you why I called...I was figuring 
                         on taking in a movie tonight, and I 
                         was wondering if you and your friend 
                         would care to see a movie tonight 
                         with me and my friend...
                              (his eyes are closed 
                              now)
                         Yeah, tonight. I know it's pretty 
                         late to call for a date, but I didn't 
                         know myself, till... Yeah, I know, 
                         well how about... Yeah, I know, well 
                         maybe next Saturday night. You free 
                         next Saturday night?... Well, how 
                         about the Saturday after that?... 
                         Yeah, I know... Yeah... Yeah... Oh, 
                         I understand, I mean...

               He hangs up, sits for a moment, then rises, opens the sliding 
               doors, enters...

               THE DINING ROOM.

               He sits at the heavy, wooden table with its white-on-white 
               table cloth.

               THE KITCHEN.

               Mrs. Pilletti ladles portions of food from the steaming 
               kettles onto a plate that she brings into...

               THE DINING ROOM.

               ...and sets it down before her son. Without a word, he picks 
               up his fork and spoon and plunges into the mountain of 
               spaghetti, adds cheese, eats away. Mrs. Pilletti takes her 
               seat, folds her hands on the table, and sits watching Marty 
               eat.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         So what are you gonna do tonight, 
                         Marty?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked 
                         out. I may just hang arounna house.

               Mrs. Pilletti nods a couple of times. A moment of silence.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Why don't you go to the Stardust 
                         Ballroom?

               This gives Marty pause. He looks up.

                                     MARTY
                         What?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I say, why don't you go to the 
                         Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with 
                         tomatoes.

               Marty regards his mother for a moment.

                                     MARTY
                         It's loaded with what?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Tomatoes.

                                     MARTY
                         Ha! Who told you about the Stardust 
                         Ballroom?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Thomas. He told me it was a very 
                         nice place.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance 
                         hall, and that's all it is. I been 
                         there a hundred times. Loaded with 
                         tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty, I don't want you hang arounna 
                         house tonight. I want you to go take 
                         a shave and go out and dance.

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, when are you gonna give up? You 
                         gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't 
                         never gonna get married.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You gonna get married.

                                     MARTY
                         Sooner or later, there comes a point 
                         in a man's life when he gotta face 
                         some facts, and one fact I gotta 
                         face is that whatever it is that 
                         women like, I ain't got it. I chased 
                         enough girls in my life. I went to 
                         enough dances. I got hurt enough. I 
                         don't wanna get hurt no more. I just 
                         called a girl just now, and I got a 
                         real brush-off, boy. I figured I was 
                         past the point of being hurt, but 
                         that hurt. Some stupid woman who I 
                         didn't even wanna call up. She gave 
                         me the brush. I don't wanna go to 
                         the Stardust Ballroom because all 
                         that ever happened to me there was 
                         girls made me feel like I was a bug. 
                         I got feelings, you know. I had enough 
                         pain. No, thank you.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty...

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch 
                         Jackie Gleason.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You gonna die without a son.

                                     MARTY
                         So I'll die without a son.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Put on your blue suit...

                                     MARTY
                         Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a 
                         fat man. A fat ugly man.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You not ugly.

                                     MARTY
                              (his voice rising)
                         I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty...

                                     MARTY
                         Ma! Leave me alone!

               He stands abruptly, his face pained and drawn. He makes half-
               formed gestures to his mother, but he can't find words at 
               the moment. He turns and marches a few paces away, turns to 
               his mother again.

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya 
                         want from me?! I'm miserable enough 
                         as it is! Leave me alone! I'll go to 
                         the Stardust Ballroom! I'll put onna 
                         blue suit and I'll go! And you know 
                         what I'm gonna get for my trouble? 
                         Heartache! A big night of heartache!

               Sullenly, he marches back to his seat, sits down, picks up 
               his fork, plunges it into the spaghetti, stuffs a mouthful 
               into his mouth, and chews vigorously for a moment. It is 
               impossible for him to remain angry long. After a while, he 
               is shaking his head.

                                     MARTY
                         Loaded with tomatoes...boy, that's 
                         rich.

               He plunges his fork in again, starts to eat. Mrs. Pilletti 
               watches Marty anxiously as we...

               FADE OUT.

               FADE IN

               NEW YORK CITY, WEST FARMS SQUARE. NIGHT

               West Farms Square is a big street in the Bronx, filled with 
               stores, bowling alleys and bars. Cars push along between the 
               pillars of the elevated subway structure. The NOISE of the 
               subway trains ROARS by overhead every few moments.

               CAMERA FINDS and ESTABLISHES the Stardust Ballroom. It 
               occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three-story 
               building. It is a hot June night, and the windows are open 
               for ventilation purposes. MUSIC manufactured by Dave 
               Greenglass and His Band blends with the NOISES of the street.

               STARDUST BALLROOM. ENTRANCE VESTIBULE/STAIRS.

               MUSIC plays in the background. CAMERA views CLARA, a plain 
               girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, MILLIE, 
               prettier; Millie's fiance ANDY, 30; and a second young man 
               DR. KEEGAN, also 30, who is a resident at Fordham Hospital. 
               They are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street 
               door.

                                     ANDY
                              (in a low voice)
                         I told you she wasn't especially 
                         attractive, but that she had a good 
                         deal of charm, and she's really a 
                         real nice girl...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                              (extracting cigarettes 
                              from the machine)
                         She's all right, Andy. It's just 
                         that I get one Saturday night off 
                         every three weeks, and I was expecting 
                         something better, that's all.

                                     ANDY
                         I told you she wasn't attractive...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         You told me that she was a little 
                         tall, but that she wasn't bad looking 
                         at all.

                                     ANDY
                         Millie's been after me to fix her up 
                         with a date, so I...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         All right, I'm having a fair time. 
                         It's just that I get one Saturday 
                         night off in three weeks, and I wanted 
                         to wind up with something tonight.

               They join the two girls waiting for them and start up the 
               broad stairway to the second floor. They are halfway up, 
               when two GIRLS come in at the top of the stairs and start 
               down. Dr. Keegan, who is holding Clara's arm, looks up, nods.

               STARDUST BALLROOM, ANTEROOM.

               This is a small, carpeted lobby with TICKET TAKER in booth, 
               a cloak room and rest rooms. Painted posters on the walls 
               announce coming events and caution against smoking. There 
               are also large blow-ups of musicians who had played this 
               ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things. About six 
               or seven PEOPLE congregate in the lobby, engaged in various 
               indifferent activities.

               CAMERA ANGLES include the swinging doors, as Clara, Andy, 
               Millie and Dr. Keegan come in. As they enter, the doors to 
               the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a GIRL in a black 
               dress, quite pretty, comes in. She starts across the anteroom 
               toward the cloak room, when Dr. Keegan calls out suddenly to 
               her.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Hey!

               The girl turns. Recognition floods her face.

                                     GIRL
                         Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         I came up to dance, wadda you think? 
                         You here with somebody?

                                     GIRL
                         I'm just here with another girl.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Where you going now?

                                     GIRL
                         I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I 
                         left them in my coat.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         I'll see you around.

                                     GIRL
                         I'll see you.

               She turns and continues on to the cloak room. Dr. Keegan 
               turns to Clara.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         That's a girl used to know.

               BALLROOM, LOUNGE.

               A fairly long room, lined on one side by a bar and on the 
               other by cheap leatherette booths. It is brightly lit and 
               crowded. There is a constant movement in and out of the 
               lounge. At the far end of the lounge, there are two large 
               iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out. Dance 
               MUSIC from dance floor.

               Clara, Dr. Keegan, Millie and Andy come into the lounge and 
               form a little group in the midst of moving PASSERSBY around 
               them. A kind of strange excitement has begun to enter Dr. 
               Keegan. He stands with the others, but his attention is 
               devoted to ogling the passing GIRLS, occasionally looking 
               back to the doors leading to the anteroom.

                                     ANDY
                         Boy, it's packed in here.

                                     MILLIE
                              (to Clara)
                         Some of these kids are awful young. 
                         Aren't you afraid you'll bump into 
                         one of your students?

                                     CLARA
                              (nervously looking at 
                              Dr. Keegan)
                         I wouldn't think so. I teach out in 
                         Brooklyn.

                                     ANDY
                         You been up here before, Clara?

                                     CLARA
                         Yeah, twice.

                                     MILLIE
                         Shall we try to get a table and get 
                         something to drink or shall we just 
                         go in and start dancing?

                                     ANDY
                         Hey, Herbie...

               Dr. Keegan doesn't seem to hear.

                                     ANDY
                              (continues)
                         Hey, Herbie...

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         What?

                                     ANDY
                         You wanna have a drink before we 
                         start dancing?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Listen. You people go grab a table. 
                         I'll be back inna minute. I'll be 
                         right back.

               He turns and moves quickly through the crowded lounge, back 
               to the swinging doors leading into the anteroom. CAMERA STAYS 
               with Clara, Millie and Andy staring after him.

                                     ANDY
                         So what do you say, Clara? Wanna see 
                         if we can get a table?

                                     CLARA
                         All right.

               They turn and move toward the booths.

               BALLROOM.

               The dance floor is fairly dark. A romantic effect is achieved 
               by papier-mâché over the chandeliers. Around the walls are 
               the stag lines -- the MEN and waiting GIRLS. They stand singly 
               or in small uneasy groups. There is constant flux and 
               movement.

               CAMERA DOLLIES slowly past the stag line, moving past faces, 
               short, fat, tall, thin stags. Some pretend indifference. 
               Some exhibit patent hunger.

               CAMERA HOLDS ANGLING to include Marty, Angie near the end of 
               the stag line. They are freshly shaved and groomed.

               MARTY AND ANGIE.

               They are leaning against the wall smoking, watching their 
               more fortunate brethren on the floor in the background.

                                     ANGIE
                         Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?

                                     MARTY
                         There was one nice-looking one there 
                         inna black dress and beads, but she's 
                         dancing now.

                                     ANGIE
                              (looking off-screen)
                         There's a nice-looking little short 
                         one for you right now.

                                     MARTY
                              (following his gaze)
                         Where?

                                     ANGIE
                         Down there. That little one there.

               REVERSE ANGLE PAST Marty and Angie across the dance floor 
               toward the wall opposite, where three GIRLS are standing. 
               Two are leaning against the wall. The third is facing them 
               with her back to the dance floor. This last girl is the one 
               Angie has in mind. She is a cute little kid about twenty and 
               wears a bright smile.

               MARTY AND ANGIE.

               They stare off toward the three girls across the room.

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah, she looks all right from here.

                                     ANGIE
                         Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask 
                         them? I'll take the one inna green 
                         dress.

                                     MARTY
                         I think this number is a little fast. 
                         Wait a minute.

               He tries a few tentative steps, testing for tempo.

                                     MARTY
                         It's all right, I think. They still 
                         there?

               The two cavaliers turn their heads and look off-screen in 
               the direction of the three girls. Apparently, the girls are 
               still there. Marty and Angie relinquish their lounging 
               positions against the wall and slouch along past the line of 
               stags with a show of determined unconcern. They edge through 
               the crush of people on the non-dancing margin of the dance 
               floor and slowly push their way toward the...

               THREE GIRLS.

               Marty and Angie come in and start to approach the three girls. 
               The girls, aware of the boys' presence, stiffen and their 
               chatter comes to a halt. Angie advances to one of the girls.

                                     ANGIE
                         Waddaya say, you wanna dance?

               The girl looks surprised, as if this were an extraordinary 
               invitation to receive in a dance hall, looks confounded at 
               her two friends, shrugs, detaches herself from the wall, 
               moves to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers, raises her 
               hand languidly to dancing position and awaits Angie with 
               ineffable boredom. Marty, smiling tentatively, addresses the 
               SHORT GIRL.

                                     MARTY
                         Excuse me, would you care for this 
                         dance?

               The Short Girl gives Marty a quick glance of appraisal, then 
               looks quickly at her remaining friend.

                                     SHORT GIRL
                              (but not unpleasantly)
                         I don't feel like dancing just yet.

                                     MARTY
                         Sure.

               He turns and heads sluggishly in the direction of the stag 
               line.

               THE STAG LINE.

               A TRAVEL SHOT follows Marty, as he moves past the line of 
               stags, all of whom are watching him. CAMERA HOLDS as he finds 
               his old niche by the wall, leans there. A moment later, he 
               glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend 
               are.

               MARTY'S P.O.V.: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper 
               young BOY who asks her to dance. She smiles, excuses herself 
               to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor.

               Marty stares at the Short Girl. He shrugs, he's used to this 
               kind of thing, then turns his attention bleakly back to 
               watching...

               THE DANCE FLOOR.

               The band starts up again and the MUSIC blares. It's a Lindy 
               Hop number. Couples swirl past; the MUSIC comes up BIG.

               THE BALLROOM.

               Marty leans against the wall, smoking and watching the dancers 
               swirl past. Dr. Keegan's VOICE is heard.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                              (off-screen)
                         You here stag or with a girl?

               Marty's attention is on the passing couples, so he doesn't 
               seem to hear. ANGLE WIDENS to include the Doctor standing on 
               Marty's right. Suddenly aware of the Doctor, Marty turns his 
               head.

                                     MARTY
                         You say something?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Yeah. I was just asking you if you 
                         was here stag or with a girl.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm stag.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on 
                         a blind date with a dog, and I just 
                         met an old girl I used to know, and 
                         I was wondering how I'm gonna get 
                         rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody 
                         to take her home, you know what I 
                         mean? I'd be glad to pay you five 
                         bucks if you take her home for me.

                                     MARTY
                              (confused)
                         What?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         I'll take you over, and I'll introduce 
                         you as an old army buddy of mine, 
                         and then I'll cut out. Because I got 
                         this other girl waiting for me out 
                         by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you 
                         five bucks.

                                     MARTY
                              (stares at the man)
                         Are you kidding?

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         No, I'm not kidding.

                                     MARTY
                         You can't just walk off onna girl 
                         like that.

               Dr. Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. Marty 
               turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. 
               The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the 
               subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to 
               the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a 
               five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall 
               and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor.

               Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the 
               Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious, 
               Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning 
               position, following in their general direction.

               Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the 
               area around the dance floor.

               ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY.

               As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor 
               proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the 
               booths.

               LOUNGE.

               Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr. 
               Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is 
               looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola 
               glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara 
               and is going through some story about being called away on 
               an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who 
               will see to it that she gets home safely.

               Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying 
               hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's 
               company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. 
               Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and 
               the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway.

               ARCHWAY.

               From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. 
               Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, 
               and he catches their conversation.

                                     DR. KEEGAN
                         ...in that case, as long as she's 
                         going home alone, give me the five 
                         bucks back...

                                     STAG
                         Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. 
                         I was willing. It's my five bucks...

               They move past and away and Marty stares after them before 
               he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen.

               Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the 
               glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed. 
               Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out 
               of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next 
               to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a 
               sign over an exit that reads "Fire Escape." Clara starts 
               moving toward that door.

               Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works 
               his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction 
               of the fire escape.

               LOUNGE.

               Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view. 
               Background sounds continue steadily.

               Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops 
               and stares off-screen.

               Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape 
               outside.

               Marty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold 
               of the...

               FIRE ESCAPE.

               It is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto 
               the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara 
               is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her 
               head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment 
               before moving a step or two forward.

               Clara doesn't turn. Marty tries to think of something to 
               say.

                                     MARTY
                              (finally)
                         Excuse me, Miss, would you care to 
                         dance?

               Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, 
               her lips trembling. Then, in one of those moments of 
               simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and 
               Marty takes her to him.

               They stand in an awkward embrace, Marty a little embarrassed, 
               looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge, 
               wondering if anybody is seeing them. He reaches back with 
               one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of 
               the heavy iron doors shut. He returns his hand around the 
               girl's shoulders. He stands stiffly, allowing her to cry on 
               his chest, as we...

               FADE OUT.

               FADE IN:

               BRONX APARTMENT HOUSE, STAIRWAY. NIGHT

               Mrs. Pilletti, in her hat and coat and carrying a purse, is 
               making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing. 
               She pauses to catch her breath on the landing. Then she moves 
               down the hallway to...

               ENTRANCE TO APARTMENT 4-B.

               Mrs. Pilletti rings the bell. The SOUND can be heard as she 
               waits. The door is opened by Virginia.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in.

               Mrs. Pilletti enters the apartment.

               APARTMENT.

               Virginia closes the door after Mrs. Pilletti enters, and 
               they stand in a small narrow hallway, brightly lit. At the 
               far end to the right is the living room in the background.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (in a low voice as 
                              she pulls off her 
                              coat)
                         Is Catherine here?

               Virginia helps her with her coat.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (nods, keeping her 
                              voice low)
                         We didn't tell her anything yet. We 
                         thought that we'd leave it to you. 
                         We thought you'd put it like how you 
                         were lonely, and why don't she come 
                         to live with you. Because that way 
                         it looks like she's doing you a favor, 
                         insteada we're throwing her out, and 
                         it won't be so cruel on her. Do you 
                         want Tommy and me to stay here with 
                         you?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I think it be a better idea if you 
                         and Thomas go out, because otherwise 
                         she's gonna start a fight with you, 
                         and everybody's gonna be yelling.

               Thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an 
               anxious smile on his face.

                                     THOMAS
                         Hello, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hello, Thomas.

                                     THOMAS
                         I just this minute got the baby to 
                         sleep.

               He comes down to Mrs. Pilletti and Virginia, lowers his voice 
               to a conspiratorial whisper.

                                     THOMAS
                         Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way 
                         to ask her is you say that you're 
                         very lonely, see? And wouldn't she 
                         come and keep you company, because 
                         that way, you see...

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a 
                         the whole thing.

               A shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered 
               conference in the hallway.

                                     CATHERINE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Who's there?! Who's there?!

               Mrs. Pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room, followed 
               by Virginia and Thomas.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (calling back)
                         It's me, Catherine! How you feel?

               CATHERINE comes in at the end of the foyer. She is a gaunt 
               woman with a face carved out of granite. She is tough, 
               embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work 
               ingrained into her features.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hey! What are you doing here?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I came to see you. How you feel?

               The two sisters quickly embrace and release each other.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I gotta pain in my left side, and my 
                         leg throbs like a drum.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I been getting a pain in my shoulder.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I 
                         have a pain in my hip, and my right 
                         arm aches so much I can't sleep. 
                         It's a curse to be old. How you feel?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I feel fine.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's nice.

               Now that the standard greetings are over, Aunt Catherine 
               abruptly turns and goes back into the living room. Mrs. 
               Pilletti follows. Virginia and Thomas remain in the doorway.

               LIVING ROOM.

               Catherine and Mrs. Pilletti enter and Catherine heads straight 
               to a chair -- obviously her chair. It is an old heavy oaken 
               chair with thick armrests. The rest of the apartment is 
               furnished in what is known as "modern." A piece from House 
               Beautiful here, a piece from American Homes and Gardens there. 
               Aunt Catherine sits erect and forbidding in her chair. Mrs. 
               Pilletti seats herself with a sigh in a neighboring chair. 
               Thomas and Virginia remain off-screen in the hallway for a 
               moment to hang up Mrs. Pilletti's coat. The two old sisters 
               sit for a moment.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, how's everything with you?

               Aunt Catherine grimaces to describe how everything is with 
               her.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         My son Marty's fine. Everybody's 
                         fine...

               Thomas comes in from the hallway, stands in the back of the 
               room, somewhat apprehensively.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         We gotta postcard from my son Nickie 
                         and his bride. They're inna big hotel 
                         in Florida on their honeymoon. 
                         Everything is very nice.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's nice. I gotta letter from my 
                         husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His 
                         mother died.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, 
                         owned the tavern in Abruzzi?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't think I remember him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Well, he died. You know who else 
                         died?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Who?

                                     CATHERINE
                         You know the old man upstairs in 
                         this house. Old Irishman, always 
                         drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna 
                         hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, I always like to visit you, 
                         Catherine, because you always got 
                         such cheerful news.

               Virginia comes into the living room with Thomas. They remain 
               in the background.

                                     THOMAS
                              (suddenly)
                         Ma, you want something to eat, some 
                         tuna fish?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hey, why don't you go to the movie? 
                         Your mother and me, we're gonna be 
                         baby-sitter.

               Thomas looks indecisively at his wife.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' 
                         apartment. They told us to come down.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure, sure.

               Thomas ponders a moment.

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, Ma, we're going downstairs 
                         to the Kaplans, if you want us for 
                         anything.

               They exit. The two old sisters sit rigidly until they hear 
               the SOUND of the door closing. Catherine cocks an eyebrow 
               and promptly launches into her statement.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I wake up this morning, I hear the 
                         baby crying. So I wake up. I come in 
                         their room. That girl is shaking her 
                         hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! 
                         Don't you strike that baby! That's 
                         my son's baby!"

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         It's her baby too, you know.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's my son Thomas's baby.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, it ain't your baby.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Did I tell you she threw the bottle-
                         a milk at me?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You told me.

                                     CATHERINE
                         She's a witch, that one. I tell you 
                         what happen yesterday?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         What happen?

                                     CATHERINE
                         She gave me the evil eye.

               She demonstrates this by pulling the lower lid of one eye 
               down and staring grotesquely at the ceiling.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (scoffing)
                         Ufa!

                                     CATHERINE
                         I keep one eye open when I sleep, 
                         because she's gonna come in, stab me 
                         in my bed.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, I want you come live in 
                         my house with Marty and me.

               Her sister turns, genuinely surprised at this request.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Ah?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You son Thomas and Virginia, they 
                         come to my house this afternoon...

                                     CATHERINE
                              (sharply)
                         Who?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Your son Thomas and his wife 
                         Virginia...

                                     CATHERINE
                         When was this?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         This afternoon, about four, five 
                         o'clock.

                                     CATHERINE
                         What they say?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You know what they say. They say 
                         things are no good in this house. 
                         Catherine, your son is married. Leave 
                         him in peace. He wantsa be alone 
                         with his wife. They don't want no 
                         old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I 
                         tell you what I think. I want you 
                         come live with me in my house with 
                         Marty and me. In my house, you have 
                         your own room. You don't have to 
                         sleep onna couch inna living room 
                         like here. We will cook inna kitchen 
                         and talk like when we were girls. 
                         You are dear to me, and you are dear 
                         to Marty. We are pleased for you to 
                         come.

               Catherine surveys her sister coldly.

                                     CATHERINE
                         My son Thomas came to see you this 
                         afternoon, and he said to you he 
                         wants to cast his mother from his 
                         house?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, don't make an opera outta 
                         this. The three-a you anna baby live 
                         in three skinny rooms. You are an 
                         old goat, and she has an Italian 
                         temper. She is a good girl, but you 
                         drive her crazy. Catherine, you are 
                         no fool. You know this is no good, 
                         an old woman living with a husband 
                         and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, 
                         anna house burns down.

               Catherine stands abruptly. She is deeply hurt.

                                     CATHERINE
                         So I am an old garbage bag, put inna 
                         street.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a 
                         tragedy. You come to my house where 
                         you know you be happier yourself.

                                     CATHERINE
                         It pains that they should do this.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I know it pains.

               Catherine turns and meanders a few steps. The stiff edge of 
               mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has 
               deserted her, and she is just a hurt old lady now.

                                     CATHERINE
                         These are the worst years, I tell 
                         you.

               She seats herself on an Eames chair. On her right, a Modern-
               Age lamp towers slimly. On her left is a Modern-Age endtable 
               with a Modern-Age ashtray on it. The hardened muscles in her 
               face suddenly slacken.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (with deep compassion)
                         Catherine, you are very dear to me. 
                         We have cried many times together. 
                         When my husband died, I would have 
                         gone insane if it were not for you. 
                         I ask you to come to my house, because 
                         I can make you happy. Please come to 
                         my house.

                                     CATHERINE
                         These are the worst years. I tell 
                         you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm 
                         afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid 
                         I'm gonna see an old lady with white 
                         hair, like the old ladies inna park, 
                         little bundles inna black shawl, 
                         waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty-
                         six years old. What am I to do with 
                         myself? I have strength in my hands. 
                         I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna 
                         make dinner for my children. Am I an 
                         old dog to lie in fronta the fire 
                         til my eyes close? These are the 
                         terrible years, Theresa! Terrible 
                         years!

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, my sister...

               Catherine stares distraught at Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     CATHERINE
                         It's gonna happen to you! It's gonna 
                         happen to you! What will you do if 
                         Marty gets married?! What will you 
                         cook? What happen to alla children 
                         playing in alla rooms? Where is the 
                         noise?! It is a curse to be a widow! 
                         A curse. What will you do if Marty 
                         gets married?! What will you do?

               She stares at Mrs. Pilletti, her deep eyes haggard and pained. 
               Mrs. Pilletti stares back for a moment, then her own eyes 
               close. Catherine has hit home. Catherine sinks back onto her 
               chair, sitting stiffly, her arms on the thick armrests. Mrs. 
               Pilletti sits hunched a little forward, her hands folded 
               nervously in her lap.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (continuing quietly)
                         I will put my clothes inna bag, and 
                         I will come to you tomorrow.

               The two sisters, somber and silent, continue to just stare 
               at one another.

               THE STARDUST BALLROOM. NIGHT

               CAMERA PANS the crowd, picking up Marty and Clara dancing 
               cheek-to-cheek on the crowded, darkened dance floor. The 
               MUSIC rides over the top of the scene.

                                     MARTY
                         You come up here often?

                                     CLARA
                         I was up here twice before. Once 
                         with a friend of mine and once I 
                         came up alone. The last time... do 
                         you see that girl in the gray dress 
                         sitting over there?

                                     MARTY
                         Yeah.

                                     CLARA
                         Well, the last time I was up here, 
                         that's where I sat. I sat there for 
                         an hour and a half, without moving a 
                         muscle. Now and then, some fellow 
                         would sort of walk up to me and then 
                         change his mind. I'll never forget 
                         just sitting there for an hour and a 
                         half with my hands in my lap. Then I 
                         began to cry, and I had to get up 
                         and go home.

                                     MARTY
                         I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.

                                     CLARA
                         This is something recent with me, 
                         this bursting into tears at the least 
                         thing.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, I cry all the time, any little 
                         thing. My brothers, my brother-in-
                         laws, they're always telling me what 
                         a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you 
                         don't get goodhearted by accident. 
                         You get kicked around long enough, 
                         you get to be a real professor of 
                         pain. I know exactly how you feel. 
                         And I also want you to know I'm having 
                         a very good time with you now and 
                         really enjoying myself. So you see, 
                         you're not such a dog as you think 
                         you are.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm having a very good time, too.

                                     MARTY
                         So there you are. So I guess I'm not 
                         such a dog as I think I am.

                                     CLARA
                         You're a very nice guy, and I don't 
                         know why some girl hasn't grabbed 
                         you off long ago.

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know either. I think I'm a 
                         very nice guy. I also think I'm a 
                         pretty smart guy in my own way.

               Clara smiles briefly at this.

                                     MARTY
                         Now I figure, two people get married, 
                         and they gonna live together forty, 
                         fifty years. So it's just gotta be 
                         more than whether they're good looking 
                         or not. You tell me you think you're 
                         not very good-looking. My father was 
                         a really ugly man, but my mother 
                         adored him. She told me that she 
                         used to get so miserable sometimes, 
                         like everybody, you know? And she 
                         says my father always tried to 
                         understand. I used to see them 
                         sometimes when I was a kid, sitting 
                         in the living room, talking and 
                         talking, and I used to adore my old 
                         man, because he was so kind. That's 
                         one of the most beautiful things I 
                         have in my life, the way my father 
                         and mother were. And my father was a 
                         real ugly man. So it doesn't matter 
                         if you look like a gorilla. So you 
                         see, dogs like us, we ain't such 
                         dogs as we think we are.

               They dance silently for a moment, cheeks pressed against 
               each other.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm twenty-nine years old. How old 
                         are you?

                                     MARTY
                         I'm thirty-four.

               BALLROOM, STAIRWAY.

               Marty and Clara are about halfway down the steps leading to 
               the street entrance to the ballroom. Clara has on a light 
               summer coat. Marty is about two steps ahead of her and has 
               to keep turning his head to talk to her. He is in an elevated 
               mood, intoxicated -- on a talking jag.

                                     MARTY
                         ...you teach chemistry? That's funny. 
                         Where? What school?

                                     CLARA
                         Benjamin Franklin High School.

                                     MARTY
                         Benjamin Franklin, where's that? 
                         Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt 
                         right up here on Fordham Road. It's 
                         right arounna corner from my house. 
                         I have a cousin who's a teacher. He 
                         teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. 
                         He was studying to be a Jesuit, but 
                         he gave it up after his first vows.

               He has reached the street landing and waits for Clara to 
               catch up with him. They stand in front of the glass doors 
               leading to the street.

               BALLROOM VESTIBULE. GLASS DOORS.

                                     MARTY
                              (prattling on)
                         I was pretty good in high school. I 
                         sound like a jerk now, but I was 
                         pretty good. I graduated with an 
                         eighty-two average. That ain't bad. 
                         I was accepted at City College. I 
                         filled out the application and 
                         everything, but my old man died, so 
                         I hadda go to work. My best class 
                         was German. That was my first 
                         language. Der, die, das -- des, der, 
                         des. There you are, I still 
                         remember...

               He pushes the glass door open to...

               THE STREET OUTSIDE THE STARDUST BALLROOM.

               As Marty and Clara emerge onto the sidewalk of West Farms 
               Square, they pause again.

               It is about nine o'clock, and the busy street is brightly 
               lit from the stores.

               PASSERSBY hurry on their way. The elevated subway RUMBLES 
               over-head intermittently.

                                     MARTY
                              (chattering on)
                         You know what I was good at in high 
                         school? I was good in Math. You know 
                         how long ago I graduated high school? 
                         June, nineteen-thirty-seven. Holy 
                         cow! June, nineteen-thirty-seven! 
                         What is that? Fifteen, seventeen 
                         years ago! Holy cow! Seventeen years 
                         ago! Is that right? Seventeen, that's 
                         right. Where did it all go? I'm 
                         getting old. I'm gonna be thirty-
                         five November eighth. Thirty-five. 
                         Wow. Time goes on, boy.

               He takes her arm, and they start walking.

                                     MARTY
                         Nineteen-thirty-seven... that's right. 
                         My old man died December, nineteen-
                         thirty-seven.

               SIDEWALK.

               MOVING SHOT as they stroll toward the corner of Jerome and 
               Burnside Avenues.

                                     MARTY
                         Two o'clock in the morning he died. 
                         The doorbell rings, and I knew 
                         something was wrong right away. 
                         Because my room is onna ground floor 
                         inna front, you see, and I got outta 
                         bed, and I answered the door...

               CAMERA HOLDS as Marty, caught in his story, stops and 
               continues intently.

                                     MARTY
                         There was Mr. Stern. He had a house 
                         down about a block from us. He moved 
                         out though. My old man, he used to 
                         play cards with him and some other 
                         old guys. He's a Jewish feller. So 
                         he said, "Is your mother home?" So I 
                         knew right away there was something 
                         wrong. I was only eighteen, exactly 
                         eighteen years old, just the month 
                         before. So I said, "Is something 
                         wrong, Mr. Stern?" I was in my 
                         pajamas, you know? So he said, "Marty, 
                         your father died." My father died 
                         right inna middle of playing cards, 
                         right at the table. He had a heart 
                         attack. He had low blood pressure, 
                         my old man. He used to faint a lot.

               Suddenly he looks at Clara, rather startled.

                                     MARTY
                         Boy, am I talking, I never talked so 
                         much in my life. Usually, everybody 
                         comes to me and tells me all their 
                         troubles. Well, I'm gonna shut up 
                         now, and I'm gonna let you get a 
                         word in...

               He takes her arm again, and they continue strolling toward 
               the corner intersection in silence.

                                     MARTY
                         Seventeen years ago. What I been 
                         doing with myself all that time?... 
                         Well, I'm talking again. I must be 
                         driving you crazy. Mosta the time 
                         I'm with a girl, I can't find a word 
                         to say. Well, I'm gonna shut up now. 
                         Because I'm not like this usually. 
                         Usually, I... well, here I go again.

               They reach the corner intersection. CAMERA HOLDS on Marty as 
               he pauses again. He stares at Clara, confused at his strange 
               loquacity.

                                     MARTY
                         I can't shut my mouth... I'm on a 
                         jag, for Pete's sake. You'd think I 
                         was loaded...

               Marty stares at Clara, absolutely aghast at his inability to 
               stop talking.

                                     MARTY
                         I can't stop talking! Isn't this 
                         stupid?!

               He stands there in the middle of the sidewalk with PEOPLE 
               moving past, back and forth. Marty continues to stare at 
               Clara, his broad face widened by a foolish, confused smile. 
               Clara regards him affectionately.

                                     MARTY
                              (with sudden sincerity)
                         You gotta real nice face, you know? 
                         It's really a nice face.

                                     CLARA
                         Thank you.

               They stroll along farther up the noisy, jangled, trafficked 
               Saturday night avenue.

               GRAND CONCOURSE LUNCHEONETTE. NIGHT.

               Once a candy store, now a soda fountain where booths have 
               been installed in the rear. One wall of the luncheonette in 
               front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling. It is 
               a nice clean joint, brightly lit. Several CUSTOMERS are 
               occupying three of the four booths.

               BOOTH.

               They sit opposite each other in the booth. Each has a cup of 
               coffee. Marty is still talking, but now he is apparently 
               telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the words 
               out. The hilarity has communicated itself to Clara. Her eyes 
               are burning with suppressed laughter. Every now and then she 
               has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of her.

                                     MARTY
                         ...so I'm inna kneeling position, 
                         and if you ever try shooting a BAR 
                         inna kneeling position, you know 
                         what I mean. I can't holda steady 
                         position. I'm wavering back and 
                         forth...

               He has to interrupt the narrative to control a seizure of 
               giggles. Clara wipes her eyes and catches her breath.

                                     MARTY
                         ...so the guy next to me, he's 
                         shooting from the prone position, 
                         and he's cross-eyed like I told you...

               He can't go on. He has to stop and cover his face with one 
               hand.

                                     MARTY
                         So just then...
                              (stops to control 
                              himself again)
                         ...so just then I hear five shots go 
                         off from the guy next to me...

               It's too much for him. He lets out a sudden guffaw and 
               instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders. Clara hides 
               her face in her hands and giggles desperately. Some of the 
               other people turn to look at them.

                                     MARTY
                         So my target goes down, and a minute 
                         later, the flag comes up. I got five 
                         bulls-eyes. This cross-eyed guy next 
                         to me, he shot five bulls-eyes into 
                         my target...

               He stares at the girl, spent from laughter.

                                     MARTY
                         ...so I said to the sergeant who was 
                         checking my score, "Pretty good, eh, 
                         Sarge? Five bulls-eyes? So this 
                         sergeant, he don't know what happened, 
                         he says, "Say, that's all right, 
                         Pilletti"...

               He closes his eyes, shakes his head.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, man. So that's what happened. 
                         That's how I got the reputation-a 
                         being the best shot inna whole 
                         battalion... oh, man...

               For a moment they seem to have controlled their laughter. 
               They sit, shaking their heads, studying their fingers on the 
               table in front of them. Then slowly, Marty begins to giggle 
               again. It communicates itself to Clara. In a moment they are 
               hiding their faces in their hands, their shoulders shivering 
               with laughter.

               STARDUST BALLROOM.

               CLOSE ON Angie. His eyes look slowly in every direction. 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK disclosing Angie standing on the fringe of 
               the dance floor, head arched high, looking at the crowded 
               dance floor. He starts back to the archway toward the lounge, 
               looking over his shoulder.

               ARCHWAY.

               Angie comes into the archway, throws one more glance over 
               his shoulder at the dance floor, then turns and enters the...

               LOUNGE.

               Angie walks down the length of the lounge, looking into the 
               booths and simultaneously at the PEOPLE moving back and forth 
               in the lounge. At the far end of the lounge, he turns and 
               comes back along the bar side, checking each face at the 
               bar.

               ANTEROOM.

               There are three young BUCKOES laying out their money for 
               admission. One of them calls to Angie.

                                     BUCKO
                         Anything good in there, Mac?

                                     ANGIE
                         A buncha dogs.

               He crosses to the Men's Room.

               MEN'S ROOM.

               Angie comes into a momentarily empty room. Angie goes the 
               full length of the white tiled room, past the wash bowls, 
               the long mirror, bending to look under the doors of the 
               stalls. Suddenly he calls out.

                                     ANGIE
                         Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty, you in here?!

               He waits for an answer...

               GRAND CONCOURSE LUNCHEONETTE.

               CLOSE ON Marty and Clara still in the booth, but two more 
               cups of coffee have been set down in front of each of them. 
               There are also two pie-plates. Clara has left half of her 
               pie. Also an empty pack of cigarettes, and another pack half-
               gone. They are both smoking. Marty is still talking, but the 
               mood is no longer laughter. A pensive, speculative hush has 
               fallen over them. They have been talking for hours, and they 
               have reached the stage where you start tearing designs in 
               the paper napkins.

                                     MARTY
                         ...When I got outta the army, Clara, 
                         I was lost. I didn't know what I 
                         wanted to do. I was twenny-five years 
                         old, what was I gonna do, go back to 
                         my old job, forty cents an hour. I 
                         thought maybe I go to college under 
                         the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? 
                         But I wouldn't graduate till I was 
                         twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, 
                         even if I made it in three years. 
                         And my brother Freddie wanted to get 
                         married, and I had three unmarried 
                         sisters -- in an Italian home, that's 
                         a terrible thing. And my kid brother 
                         Nickie, he's a one got married last 
                         week. So I just went to pieces. I 
                         used to walk inna streets till three, 
                         four o'clock inna mornings. My mother 
                         used to be so worried about me. My 
                         uncle Mario come over one time. He 
                         offered me a job driving his hack 
                         onna night shift. He got his own 
                         cab, you know. And God forgive me 
                         for what I'm gonna say now, but I 
                         used to thinka doing away with myself. 
                         I used to stand sometimes in the 
                         subway, and God forgive me what I'm 
                         going to say, I used to feel the 
                         tracks sucking me down under the 
                         wheels.

                                     CLARA
                              (deeply sympathetic)
                         Yes, I know.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm a Catholic, you know, and even 
                         to think about suicide is a terrible 
                         sin.

                                     CLARA
                         Yes, I know.

                                     MARTY
                         So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a 
                         frienda my father -- he offered me 
                         this job in his butcher shop, and 
                         everybody pleaded with me to take 
                         it. So that's what happened. I didn't 
                         wanna be a butcher.

                                     CLARA
                         There's nothing wrong with being a 
                         butcher.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant 
                         profession. It's in a lower social 
                         scale. People look down on butchers.

                                     CLARA
                         I don't.

               Marty looks quickly up at her, then back down.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa 
                         sell his shop now, because he and 
                         his wife are lonely, and they wanna 
                         move out to California in Los Angeles 
                         and live near their married daughter. 
                         Because she's always writing them to 
                         come out there. So it's a nice little 
                         shop. I handle his books for him, so 
                         I know he has a thirty-five percent 
                         markup which is not unreasonable, 
                         and he takes home net maybe a hundred, 
                         hundred and fifty bucks a week. The 
                         point is, of course, you gotta worry 
                         about the supermarkets. There's two 
                         inna neighborhood now, and there's 
                         an A&P coming in, at least that's 
                         the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade 
                         is strictly Italian, but the younger 
                         Italian girls, they get married, and 
                         they don't stick to the old Italian 
                         dishes so much. I mean, you gotta 
                         take that into account too.

                                     CLARA
                         It's my feeling that you really want 
                         to buy this shop, Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         That's true. I do. But I'm gonna 
                         have to take outta loan inna bank 
                         eight thousand dollars. That's a big 
                         note to carry, because I have to 
                         give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and 
                         what I have to weigh is: will it pay 
                         off in the end more than I can make 
                         onna salary?

               Clara looks down at her fingers, her face alive and sensitive. 
               She carefully assembles her words in her mind. Then she looks 
               at the squat butcher across the table from her.

                                     CLARA
                         Marty, I know you for three hours, 
                         but I know you're a good butcher. 
                         You're an intelligent, sensitive, 
                         decent man. I have a feeling about 
                         you like sometimes a kid comes in to 
                         see me for one reason or another. 
                         And some of these kids, Marty, in my 
                         classes, they have so much warmth in 
                         them, so much capacity. And that's 
                         the feeling I get about you.

               Marty shuts his eyes, then opens them quickly, bows his head.

                                     CLARA
                         If you were one of my students, I 
                         would say, "Go ahead and buy the 
                         butcher shop. You're a good butcher."

               Clara pauses.

                                     MARTY
                              (not quite trusting 
                              the timbre of his 
                              voice)
                         Well, there's a lotta things I could 
                         do with this shop. I could organize 
                         my own supermarket. Get a buncha 
                         neighborhood merchants together. 
                         That's what a lotta them are doing.

               He looks up at her now.

                                     MARTY
                         Wadda you think?

                                     CLARA
                         I think anything you want to do, 
                         you'll do well.

               Tears begin to flood his eyes again. He quickly looks away. 
               He licks his lips.

                                     MARTY
                              (still looking down)
                         I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?

               Clara looks down at her hands.

                                     CLARA
                              (also in a low voice)
                         Yes, I am.

               Marty looks up at her.

                                     MARTY
                         I only got about three bucks on me 
                         now, but I just live about eight 
                         blocks from here on the other side 
                         of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk 
                         back to my house? I'll run in, pick 
                         up some dough, and let's step out 
                         somewhere.

                                     CLARA
                         I really should get home...

               She twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the 
               luncheonette.

                                     MARTY
                         It's only a quarter of twelve. The 
                         clock's right over there.

                                     CLARA
                         I really should get home, I told my 
                         father... Well, I suppose a little 
                         while longer. I wonder if there's 
                         any place around here I could put 
                         some makeup on...

               Marty considers this problem for a second, then leans out of 
               the booth and calls out.

                                     MARTY
                         Hey, Mac!

               CAMERA ANGLES to include the PROPRIETOR of the luncheonette. 
               He is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the Sunday 
               Mirror. He looks up toward Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         You gotta Ladies' Room around here?

                                     PROPRIETOR
                         Inna back.

                              (to Clara)
                         Inna back.

               Clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie, then edges out of 
               the booth, taking her purse with her.

               187TH STREET. NIGHT.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Angie meandering down the street on which 
               the neighborhood bar is located. It is near midnight, and 
               the street is empty except for Angie and the CLACKING of his 
               leather heels on the pavement. He comes to the bar, opens 
               the door, enters...

               THE BAR. NIGHT.

               The SOUNDS of Saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly 
               from the Irish contingent of the neighborhood. They are 
               grouped along practically the whole bar. Three or four WOMEN 
               and a number of shirtsleeved MEN, mostly in their late 
               forties, early fifties. We know they're Irish, because one 
               of the younger men is chanting an auld country ballad.

               CAMERA ANGLES disclose the entrance to the bar in the 
               background, showing Angie coming in, looking here and there. 
               He starts toward the bar.

               NEAR BAR.

               TWO IRISH WOMEN, middle-aged, squat heavily on bar stools 
               over their schooners of beer, gassing away at each other.

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         ...so she told me that the doctor 
                         told her that if she had any more 
                         babies, she would do so at the risk 
                         of her life...

               Angie shuffles in, pausing near the bar and standing behind 
               the two Irish women.

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         She was always a bit thin in the 
                         hips...

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         Well, at the time she told me this, 
                         she already had six. Every time I 
                         saw the woman, she was either...

                                     ANGIE
                         Hey, Lou!

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         ...going to the hospital or coming 
                         from it. She was hatching them out 
                         like eggs.

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         And that husband of hers is a skinny 
                         bit of a fellow, isn't he?

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         Well, I bumped into her on the street, 
                         and she was as big as a barrel.

                                     ANGIE
                              (loudly)
                         Hey, Lou!

                         What?

                         Marty been in here the last coupla

                         you tell me that another one'll kill 
                         you?"

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         And her husband is a little bit of a 
                         man, isn't he?

                                     ANGIE

                         Well, last week Tuesday, she gave 
                         birth to the baby in Saint Elizabeth's 
                         hospital... a big healthy boy of 
                         nine pounds...

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was 
                         wrong, wasn't he?

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, no! She died right in the 
                         hospital...

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, that's a sad story. And her 
                         husband is that little fellow, works 
                         in Peter Reeves.

                                     FIRST IRISH WOMAN
                         That's the one.

                                     SECOND IRISH WOMAN
                         Oh, that's a sad story.

               Angie has nothing better to do than give his attention to 
               the last lines of the story. Perturbed, he turns and leaves.

               NEAR ELEVATED SUBWAY. NIGHT.

               With street NOISES over the scene, Marty and Clara walk along 
               through the intricate understructure of the elevated subway 
               toward Webster Avenue.

               STREET.

               Marty and Clara walk slowly along a side street in Marty's 
               neighborhood. The streets are almost empty; perhaps an 
               occasional PEDESTRIAN on the other side of the street. The 
               cars are parked bumper-to-bumper in lines along the curb. 
               The five-story apartment buildings are mostly dark, an 
               occasional window lit.

               Marty suddenly stops and bends down; his shoe lace has become 
               untied. Clara sits back against the fender of the nearest 
               car and continues talking.

                                     CLARA
                         ...It's really a fine opportunity 
                         for me. But I'm not sure I want to 
                         be a department head. It's mostly 
                         executive and administrative work. 
                         Well, anyway, I told you about my 
                         father, and he depends on me a great 
                         deal, and...

                                     MARTY
                              (still concentrating 
                              on his shoelace)
                         Why don't you just move out to 
                         Portchester?

                                     CLARA
                         Well, that's what I was saying. My 
                         father is getting old. And we're 
                         very close. He's a wonderful man, 
                         really...

               She pauses as he straightens. He looks at her a moment.

                                     MARTY
                         I think you're kidding yourself, 
                         Clara. I used to think about moving 
                         out, you know? And that's what I 
                         used to say. "My mother needs me." 
                         But when you really get down to it, 
                         that ain't it at all. Actually, you 
                         need your father. You know what I 
                         mean? You're living at home, and you 
                         got your father and mother there, 
                         and you can go on like that -- being 
                         a little girl all your life.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm afraid of being lonely.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll 
                         make friends right away.

                                     CLARA
                         Actually, I don't make friends easily.

                                     MARTY
                         What're you talking about? You're a 
                         real likeable person. You'll make 
                         friends out there in Portchester 
                         one, two, three. You'll have people 
                         visiting you alla time. I'll come 
                         visit you. I'll borrow my brother 
                         Freddie's car, or you can call me up 
                         when you feel blue, or I'll call you 
                         up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be 
                         so afraid.

               They have only gone a few paces farther when Marty's shoelace 
               comes loose again. He fidgets self-consciously, bends down 
               and begins to retie it. The VOICE of Ralph, the well-dressed 
               man, established previously, is heard.

                                     RALPH'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hey, Marty!

               Marty and Clara both look off...

               STREET. CAR WINDOW.

               Ralph is leaning out the car window twisting to look back up 
               the street.

                                     RALPH
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, Marty!

               Marty and Clara look around to find the source of the voice.

                                     RALPH
                         Marty! Over here!

               Marty and Clara again look around trying to find Ralph. Marty 
               spots him leaning out of the window of a '47 Chevy parked in 
               the background.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ralph.

                                     RALPH
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.

               Marty and Clara start walking toward the Chevy.

               INSIDE THE CHEVY.

               Ralph and MABEL, a young woman in her early thirties, are 
               seated in front. In the rear seat of the car, LEO is 
               sandwiched in between a MISS LOUISE KELLY and a MISS ELAINE 
               RITCHIE.

                                     RALPH
                              (explaining to girls)
                         You'll like this guy. This guy's a 
                         nice guy.

                                     LEO
                         Who's this? Marty?

                                     RALPH
                         Yeah.

                                     LEO
                              (confirming Ralph's 
                              statement)
                         Oh, this guy's a nice guy.

               STREET.

               Marty stops and excuses himself from Clara to walk slowly 
               toward the Chevy. It's about five cars down from him. The 
               camera pans with him.

               OUTSIDE THE CHEVY.

               Ralph is leaning out of the window again, watching Marty 
               approach.

                                     MARTY
                              (approaching the car)
                         Hello, Ralph, what's new?
                              (looks through the 
                              back window, 
                              recognizes Leo)
                         Hiya, Leo.

                                     LEO
                         Hiya, Marty.

                                     RALPH
                              (indicates with his 
                              head that he wishes 
                              to hold a whispered 
                              conference with Marty)
                         Hey, Marty, come here a minute.

               Marty leans with his elbow on the open front window of the 
               car, his head bowed, waiting for Ralph to speak his piece. 
               He studiously avoids looking at the girls in the car.

                                     RALPH
                              (lowering his voice)
                         Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel 
                         here, you interested?

               Marty allows his eyes to flicker quickly over the girl in 
               the seat next to Ralph.

                                     MARTY
                         Waddaya mean, Ralph?

                                     RALPH
                              (turning his head 
                              toward the rear of 
                              the car and raising 
                              his voice)
                         Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty 
                         Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, 
                         inna back seat there.

                                     MARTY
                         Hiya.

               Louise, not an unattractive girl by any means, is a little 
               surly at the moment. She merely nods at the introduction.

                                     LOUISE
                         What are we going to do, just sit 
                         around here all night?

                                     RALPH
                              (addressing Marty's 
                              bowed head in a quick 
                              mutter)
                         Listen, Marty, these three squirrels 
                         are nurses. We're all going over 
                         Leo's house later because there's 
                         nobody there. These are the squirrels 
                         I told you about. Money inna bank, 
                         man. Wanna get inna car? She's a 
                         pretty nice-looking doll.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm with a girl, Ralph.

                                     RALPH
                         Get ridda her. This is money inna 
                         bank.

                                     MARTY
                         I can't do that, Ralph, because 
                         somebody already brushed her off 
                         once tonight.

                                     RALPH
                         This is a good deal here, Marty.

               Marty straightens, looks surreptitiously back to the corner 
               where Clara is standing.

               Clara stands alone on the corner. She is an angular, awkward, 
               plain girl. Marty brings his attention back around to Ralph 
               who is leaning out of the car window.

                                     MARTY
                              (bending down to Ralph)
                         I can't do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway.
                              (looks toward back 
                              seat)
                         Very nice to have met you all.

                                     LOUISE
                         Come on, let's get outta here.

                                     LEO
                         Hey, Ralph, we might as well get 
                         going.

               Ralph bends forward and starts the car.

                                     MARTY
                         I'll see you, Leo.

                                     LEO
                         I'll see you, Marty.

               Marty takes a step or two back from the car, and Ralph begins 
               the business of wheeling the car from out of its parking 
               place. The car backs and fills once or twice and eventually 
               clears and whisks into the street.

               Marty stands looking after the departing car, then slowly 
               turns and goes back up the sidewalk. He joins Clara and we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PILLETTI HOME, KITCHEN. NIGHT

               Marty and Clara come into the dark house. Nobody is home. 
               Marty and Clara's silhouettes block the doorway momentarily.

                                     MARTY
                         Wait a minute. Lemme find the light.

               He finds the lights. The kitchen is suddenly brightly lit. 
               The two of them stand squinting to adjust to the sudden glare.

                                     MARTY
                         I guess my mother ain't home yet. I 
                         figure my cousin Thomas and Virginia 
                         musta gone to the movies, so they 
                         won't get back till one o'clock at 
                         least.

               Clara advances into the kitchen, a little ill at ease, and 
               looks around. Marty closes the porch door.

                                     MARTY
                         This is the kitchen.

                                     CLARA
                         Yes, I know.

                                     MARTY
                         Come on inna dining room.

               He turns the light on as he enters. Clara follows him into 
               the...

               DINING ROOM.

                                     MARTY
                         Siddown, take off your coat. You 
                         want something to eat? We gotta whole 
                         half-chicken in the icebox.

                                     CLARA
                              (alighting tentatively 
                              on the edge of a 
                              chair)
                         No, thank you. I don't think I should 
                         stay very long.

                                     MARTY
                         Sure. Just take off your coat a 
                         minute.

               He helps her off with her coat. He remains behind her, looking 
               down at her. Conscious of his scrutiny, she sits 
               uncomfortably, breathing unevenly. Marty takes her coat into 
               the dark living room. Clara is patient but nervous. Marty 
               comes back, sits on another chair, and there is an awkward 
               silence.

                                     MARTY
                         So I was telling you, my kid brother 
                         Nickie got married last Sunday. That 
                         was a very nice affair. And they had 
                         this statue of some woman, and they 
                         had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. 
                         I never saw anything so grand in my 
                         life.
                              (the silence again 
                              falls between them.)
                         And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I 
                         know a good hunka steak when I see 
                         one. That was choice filet, right 
                         off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty 
                         a pound. Of course, if you wanna 
                         cheaper cut, get rib steak. That 
                         gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes 
                         to about a buck and a quarter a pound, 
                         if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make 
                         yourself comfortable. You're all 
                         tense.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh, I'm fine.

                                     MARTY
                         You want me to take you home, I'll 
                         take you home.

                                     CLARA
                         Maybe that would be a good idea.

               She stands. He stands. He's a little angry. He turns and 
               sullenly goes back to the living room for her coat. 
               Wordlessly, he begins to help her into the coat.

               Standing behind her, he puts his hands on her shoulders, 
               then suddenly seizes her, and begins kissing her on the neck. 
               As Marty holds Clara, kissing the back of her neck, the 
               dialogue drops to quick, hushed whispers.

                                     CLARA
                         No, Marty, please...

                                     MARTY
                         I like you. I like you. I been telling 
                         you all night, I like you...

                                     CLARA
                         Marty...

                                     MARTY
                         I just wanna kiss, that's all.

               He attempts to turn her face toward him. She resists.

                                     CLARA
                         No...

                                     MARTY
                         Please...

                                     CLARA
                         No...

                                     MARTY
                         Please...

                                     CLARA
                         Marty...

               He releases her and turns away violently.

                                     MARTY
                         All right! I'll take you home! All 
                         right!

               He marches a few paces away, deeply disturbed. He turns back 
               to her.

                                     MARTY
                         All I wanted was a lousy kiss! What 
                         do you think, I was gonna try 
                         something serious with my mother 
                         coming home any minute!? What am I, 
                         a leper or something?!

               He turns and goes into the living room to hide the flush of 
               hot tears threatening to fill his eyes. Clara is also on the 
               verge of tears.

                                     CLARA
                              (more to herself than 
                              to him)
                         I just didn't feel like it, that's 
                         all.

               Slowly, she moves to the archway leading to the living room. 
               CAMERA ANGLES to include the living room where Marty sits on 
               the couch with his hands in his lap, staring straight ahead. 
               The room is dark except for the slanted light coming from 
               the dining room.

               Clara goes to the couch and sits on the edge beside him. He 
               doesn't look at her.

               LIVING ROOM.

                                     MARTY
                         I'm old enough to know better. Comes 
                         New Year's Eve, everybody starts 
                         arranging parties, I'm the guy they 
                         gotta dig up a date for. Let me getta 
                         packa cigarettes, and I'll take you 
                         home.

               He starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch, 
               looking straight ahead. Clara looks at him, her face 
               peculiarly soft and compassionate.

                                     CLARA
                         I'd like to see you again. Very much. 
                         The reason I didn't let you kiss me 
                         was because I just didn't know how 
                         to handle the situation. You're the 
                         kindest man I ever met. The reason I 
                         tell you this is because I want to 
                         see you again very much. I know that 
                         when you take me home, I'm going to 
                         just lie on my bed and think about 
                         you. I want very much to see you 
                         again.

               Marty stares down at his hands.

                                     MARTY
                              (without looking over 
                              at her)
                         Waddaya doing tomorrow night?

                                     CLARA
                         Nothing.

                                     MARTY
                         I'll call you up tomorrow morning. 
                         Maybe, we'll go see a movie.

                                     CLARA
                         I'd like that very much.

                                     MARTY
                         The reason I can't be definite about 
                         it now is my Aunt Catherine is 
                         probably coming over tomorrow, and I 
                         may have to help out.

                                     CLARA
                         I'll wait for your call.

                                     MARTY
                         We better get started to your house, 
                         because the buses only run about one 
                         an hour now.

                                     CLARA
                         All right.

               She stands.

                                     MARTY
                         I'll just get a packa cigarettes.

               He rises and goes into his bedroom. CAMERA ANGLES to include 
               door to bedroom. Marty opens his bureau drawer and extracts 
               a pack of cigarettes. He comes back out and looks at Clara 
               for the first time. They start to walk to the dining room. 
               In the archway, Marty pauses and turns to her.

                                     MARTY
                         Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?

                                     CLARA
                         Nothing.

               They quietly slip into each other's arms and kiss. Slowly 
               their faces part, and Marty's head sinks down upon her 
               shoulder. He is crying, detectable from the slight shake of 
               his shoulders. The girl presses her cheek against the back 
               of his head. They stand. The SOUND of the kitchen door opening 
               splits them out of their embrace. A moment later Mrs. 
               Pilletti's voice is heard.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hallo! Hallo! Marty?!

               She comes into the dining room, stops at the sight of Marty 
               and Clara.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hello, Marty, when you come home?

                                     MARTY
                         We just got here about fifteen minutes 
                         ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss 
                         Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New 
                         York University. She teaches chemistry 
                         in Benjamin Franklin High School.

               This seems to impress Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Siddown, siddown. You want some 
                         chicken? We got some chicken in the 
                         ice box.

                                     CLARA
                         No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going 
                         home. Thank you very much anyway.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, siddown a minute. I just come 
                         inna house. I'll take off my coat. 
                         Siddown a minute.

               Mrs. Pilletti pulls her coat off.

                                     MARTY
                         How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give 
                         you a ride?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (nodding)
                         Oh, it's a sad business.
                              (turning to Clara)
                         My sister, Catherine, she don't get 
                         along with her daughter-in-law, so 
                         she's gonna come live with us.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh, sure.
                              (to Clara)
                         Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her 
                         siddown.

                                     MARTY
                         Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.

               Clara smiles and sits. Mrs. Pilletti likewise seats herself, 
               holding her coat in her lap.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (to Marty)
                         Did you offer the young lady some 
                         fruit?

                                     MARTY
                         I offered her, Ma, she don't want 
                         nothing.

                                     CLARA
                         No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (to Clara with a sigh)
                         It's a very sad business, I tell 
                         you. A woman, fifty-six years old, 
                         all her life, she had her own home. 
                         Now she's just an old lady, sleeping 
                         on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's 
                         a curse to be a mother, I tell you. 
                         Your children grow up and then what 
                         is left for you to do? What is a 
                         mother's life but her children? It 
                         is a very cruel thing when your son 
                         has no place for you in his home.

                                     CLARA
                         Couldn't she find some sort of hobby 
                         to fill out her time?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hobby! What can she do? She cooks 
                         and she cleans. You gotta have a 
                         house to clean. You gotta have 
                         children to cook for. These are the 
                         terrible years for a woman, the 
                         terrible years.

                                     CLARA
                         You mustn't feel too harshly against 
                         her daughter-in-law. She also wants 
                         to have a house to clean and a family 
                         to cook for.

               Mrs. Pilletti darts a quick, sharp look at Clara. Then she 
               looks back to her own hands, which are beginning to twist 
               nervously.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         You don't think my sister Catherine 
                         should live in her daughter-in-law's 
                         house?

                                     CLARA
                         Well, I don't know the people, of 
                         course, but as a rule, I don't think 
                         a mother-in-law should live with a 
                         young couple.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Where do you think a mother-in-law 
                         should go?

                                     CLARA
                         I don't think a mother should depend 
                         so much upon her children for her 
                         rewards in life.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, maybe that's what they teach 
                         you in New York University. In real 
                         life, it don't work out that way. 
                         You wait till you are a mother.

                                     CLARA
                         It's silly of me to argue about it. 
                         I don't know the people involved.

                                     MARTY
                         Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. 
                         It's getting late, and the buses 
                         only run about one an hour.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (standing)
                         Sure.

                                     CLARA
                              (standing)
                         It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. 
                         Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

               Marty and Clara move toward the kitchen.

                                     MARTY
                         All right, Ma. I'll be back in about 
                         an hour, an hour anna half.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

                                     CLARA
                         Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Goodnight.

               Marty and Clara go out through the kitchen. CAMERA STAYS on 
               Mrs. Pilletti, who stands expressionlessly by her chair, 
               staring after them. She remains there rigid even after the 
               kitchen door has OPENED and SHUT.

               FORDHAM ROAD. NIGHT

               The biggest intersection in the Bronx is near the Grand 
               Concourse at Fordham Road, which is the biggest boulevard. 
               Despite the hour, the sidewalks are crowded with PEOPLE. The 
               TRAFFIC is heavy with buses.

               We PICK UP Angie walking up Fordham Road just about to the 
               Grand Concourse. As he reaches the northeast corner of the 
               intersection and stands, waiting for the light to change, he 
               looks off-screen. Something captures his attention, and he 
               calls out.

                                     ANGIE
                         Hey!!

               STREET OUTSIDE A DEPARTMENT STORE.

               In front of Alexander's Department Store, the street is 
               crowded, and a bus queue waits for the downtown Concourse 
               bus. Marty and Clara are part of the queue.

                                     ANGIE
                              (starting toward Marty 
                              and Clara, shouting)
                         Hey!

               Angie starts into the street without waiting for the lights 
               to change. Impatiently, he has to wait until traffic stops 
               for the light.

                                     ANGIE
                              (shouting as he goes)
                         Hey, Marty! Hey!

               Marty and Clara still stand, seeming not to hear Angie.

                                     ANGIE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Hey, Marty! Marty!

               Marty and Clara turn and stare off-screen.

               Angie pushes his way through the CROWD on the sidewalk and 
               manages to join Marty and Clara.

                                     ANGIE
                         Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I 
                         been looking all over for you.

                                     MARTY
                         I looked for you, Angie, before I 
                         cut out, but I couldn't find you.

                                     ANGIE
                         I been looking all over for you!

               Angie is absolutely unaware of, or simply refuses to 
               acknowledge the presence of the girl. He has pushed himself 
               in between Marty and Clara, and addresses himself entirely 
               to Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         What happened, Angie, was that we 
                         thought we were just gonna go for a 
                         short walk, and then we thought we 
                         were gonna come right back, but we 
                         got to talking. Listen, Angie, I 
                         want you to meet Clara...
                              (he tries to turn the 
                              sullen Angie toward 
                              Clara)
                         Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. 
                         I told you about him.

                                     CLARA
                         How do you do?

               Angie acknowledges the introduction with a surly nod.

                                     ANGIE
                              (completely ignoring 
                              Clara now)
                         Waddaya gonna do now?

                                     MARTY
                         I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close 
                         to one.

                                     ANGIE
                         You want me to ride down with you?

                                     MARTY
                         What for?

                                     ANGIE
                         It's early.

                                     MARTY
                         It must be one o'clock.

                                     ANGIE
                         It's Saturday night! There's still 
                         plenty-a action around!

                                     MARTY
                         Angie, by the time I get Clara home, 
                         it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By 
                         the time I get home, it's gonna be 
                         two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten 
                         o'clock mass tomorrow.

               Angie stares with thick, sullen jealousy at his best friend. 
               He turns sharply and starts away from Marty and Clara.

                                     ANGIE
                              (as he goes)
                         All right, I'll see you!

                                     MARTY
                              (calling after him)
                         Where you going?

               Angie, feeling rejected and jealous, moves swiftly out into 
               the other PEDESTRIANS on Fordham Road.

                                     MARTY
                              (calling more loudly 
                              after him)
                         I'll see you tomorrow after mass!

               He stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend, 
               then turns to Clara with a shrug and a smile, as if to say, 
               "I don't know what's the matter with him." The long-awaited 
               downtown bus ROARS up to the corner, blocking our view of 
               Marty and Clara.

               LOWER-MIDDLE-CLASS BRONX STREET. NIGHT.

               Marty and Clara stroll along the walk toward the front doors 
               of an apartment house.

               APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY. NIGHT.

               Marty and Clara enter and cross the lobby toward the stairway. 
               They move slowly.

                                     MARTY
                         You got an elevator in this house?

                                     CLARA
                         We just live one flight up.

                                     MARTY
                         So I'll call you tomorrow.

                                     CLARA
                         Okay.

               Clara leans against the iron banister of the stairway.

                                     CLARA
                         Call me about two-thirty, because I 
                         won't be home from my aunt's till 
                         about then.

               The doors of the ELEVATOR slide open, and a middle-aged COUPLE 
               comes out. They have obviously been having a heated exchange; 
               but at the sight of Marty and the girl at the stairway, they 
               become silent. They march across the lobby and out to the 
               street in repressed silence. The door CLANGS behind them.

               Marty and Clara have waited stiffly through this interruption, 
               and now they look at each other and smile.

                                     MARTY
                         Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night 
                         then.

                                     CLARA
                         Okay.

               Marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street 
               door.

               OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT HOUSE.

               Marty stands a moment in the clear black night air, 
               expressionless, but within him, a strange exhilaration is 
               beginning to stir. He mosies away from the building along 
               the sidewalk, CAMERA panning with him.

               He strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he 
               knew where he was going.

               176TH STREET.

               CLOSER SHOT of Marty marching along 176th Street. He quickly 
               reaches the Grand Concourse. Here he pauses a moment, a little 
               at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he 
               needs the uptown bus.

               He moves across the wide street to get to the other side of 
               the boulevard. Again, he seems to lose track of which 
               direction is homeward.

               He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing 
               every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming.

               Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot, then drops back into 
               the stiff stride as he approaches...

               THE INTERSECTION OF THE GRAND CONCOURSE.

               The corner near the bus stop is deserted. Marty stops, leans 
               against the pole of the bus stop sign.

               Abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further.

               SERIES OF INTERCUTS: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes 
               to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves 
               back. The traffic moves by him. He stands in the wide street, 
               then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises 
               his arm and calls out.

                                     MARTY
                         Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

               CLOSE-UP of Marty standing in the street, crying...

                                     MARTY
                         Taxi!... Taxi!...

               FADE OUT.

               PILLETTI HOME, MARTY'S BEDROOM. DAY

               Marty is in his trousers and T-shirt. He whistles as he 
               assembles his toilet articles for a shave. He starts out 
               toward the living room, still whistling. Bright sunlight 
               pours through the curtains on his window.

               SECOND FLOOR.

               Marty's whistling accompanies him to the second floor where 
               he turns into the bathroom. CAMERA ANGLES to include Mrs. 
               Pilletti's bedroom, disclosing her wearing an old faded 
               batiste kimona, puttering around her room and cleaning. As 
               Marty's toneless tune reaches her, Mrs. Pilletti turns her 
               head and stares off, listening.

               THOMAS AND VIRGINIA'S APARTMENT. DAY.

               Catherine, in the living room, is packing her meager but 
               neatly folded belongings into an old European carpet bag. 
               She has regained her stiff, mordant crustiness. The mild 
               WAIL of a baby can be heard.

               BEDROOM.

               The crowded bedroom is furnished in white modern. It is 
               cluttered by a baby's bassinet and other baby items. Virginia 
               sits on the edge of the bed, holding the baby, quieting it. 
               She is half-dressed, wearing her pajama top, a half-slip, no 
               stockings; her hair is still uncombed. Thomas slouches against 
               a chest of drawers, in morning semi-deshabille. He is 
               obviously sick with guilt. Virginia looks anxiously at her 
               husband then to the baby in her arms.

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (heavy whisper)
                         Don't you think I feel lousy about 
                         this too?

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna 
                         talk anymore about it.
                              (sits on a wooden 
                              chair, unrolls a 
                              fresh pair of socks 
                              he's been holding)
                         I don't think I got one hour's sleep 
                         the whole night.
                              (raises one leg to 
                              put a sock on, pauses 
                              with his heel on the 
                              edge of his chair)
                         Last night was the first time in my 
                         life I ever heard my mother cry, you 
                         know that?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy...

                                     THOMAS
                              (snapping)
                         I don't wanna talk about it!

               He pulls his sock on angrily, then lets his leg fall back to 
               the floor and just sits, one sock on, one sock in his hand. 
               He looks sullenly in the direction of his wife.

                                     THOMAS
                              (continuing, huffy)
                         I know what you're gonna say. A man's 
                         gotta stop being his mother's baby 
                         sooner or later. How many times you 
                         gonna say it? She's my mother, you 
                         know. I oughta have some feelings 
                         about her, don't you think?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Why do you always put me inna position 
                         of being the louse?

                                     THOMAS
                              (in a furious whisper)
                         Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more 
                         about it!

               He stands, then becomes aware he has to put on his other 
               sock. He sits down again and pulls the second sock on. 
               Virginia has had a hot reply in her mouth, but she forces it 
               back. She rocks the baby a little.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy, I love you, and I know you 
                         feel lousy right now, but we're never 
                         gonna be happy unless we have a chance 
                         to work out our own lives. We can't 
                         keep talking in whispers like this 
                         the resta our lives. We gotta have 
                         some privacy. We...

               Thomas has risen, a slim, dark, unsettled young man in 
               undershirt and trousers, holding his shoes in one hand. He 
               starts toward the...

               FOYER.

               Thomas strides down the little foyer. He turns and looks 
               into the living room. He watches his mother packing strange 
               brown parcels into her bag.

                                     THOMAS
                              (scowling)
                         Can't you wait five minutes? I'll 
                         drive you over inna car. I just gotta 
                         put my shirt on, that's all.

               The old lady nods brusquely.

               LIVING ROOM.

               Thomas stands with his head bowed to hide the tears he feels 
               sweeping into his hot eyes. Then he returns to his bedroom 
               in his stocking-feet, carrying his shoes.

               BEDROOM.

               Thomas comes in just as Virginia bends over the bassinet, 
               having gotten the baby back to sleep. Thomas cries to her in 
               a furious whisper.

                                     THOMAS
                         All right, get dressed, because we're 
                         gonna drive my mother over. Why 
                         couldn't you get along with her?! 
                         Why couldn't you make just a little 
                         effort?! She's a little hard to get 
                         along with! All right! All I asked 
                         you was try a little.

               He turns from her, sits down on the bed miserably angry with 
               the world, his wife, his mother, himself. The baby begins to 
               whimper again. Virginia turns wearily to her husband.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Tommy...

                                     THOMAS
                              (roaring out)
                         I don't wanna hear anymore about it, 
                         you hear me?

               MARTY'S HOME, FRONT PORCH. DAY.

               A small procession consisting of Thomas carrying his mother's 
               carpet bag, his mother carrying small paper-wrapped bundles, 
               and Virginia holding the baby comes across the front hedge. 
               Thomas leads the parade with a muffled sorrow. They turn up 
               the porch to the front door. Virginia remains in the small 
               front yard. She is miserable.

               PILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. DAY.

               Mrs. Pilletti is dressed in hat and coat and all set to go 
               to mass. She is bent over the dining room table piling the 
               breakfast dishes and crumbing the table. She looks up as 
               Thomas comes in carrying his mother's bag. Aunt Catherine is 
               right behind him. Beyond the porch, we can see Virginia 
               walking the baby around outside.

                                     THOMAS
                         Hello, Aunt Theresa.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?

                                     THOMAS
                              (setting the bag down)
                         Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. 
                         I hadda beg her to let me drive her 
                         over here. The martyr. She always 
                         gotta be the big martyr.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hey, will you go to mass, please. 
                         This one, he woke up this morning 
                         with salt in his nose. Do this! Do 
                         that! Will you leave me in peace, 
                         ah?

               A burst of spirited song soars from upstairs. Mrs. Pilletti, 
               Aunt Catherine and even Thomas pause to look up in the 
               direction of the voice.

               HALLWAY/STAIRWAY.

               Marty descends the stairs whistling. He carries his jacket 
               over his arm. He makes some final adjustments to his tie.

               DINING ROOM.

               Alert to Marty's mood, Mrs. Pilletti, Aunt Catherine and 
               Thomas stand, waiting for him to join them downstairs.

                                     MARTY
                              (ebulliently)
                         Hello, Aunt Catherine! How are you? 
                         Hello, Thomas. You going to mass 
                         with us?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I was at mass two hours ago.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, make yourself at home. The 
                         refrigerator is loaded with food. Go 
                         upstairs, take any room you want. 
                         Thomas, you going to mass with us?

                                     THOMAS
                              (nods)
                         Yeah, yeah, sure.

               He abruptly goes out into the living room and onto the front 
               porch.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                              (to Catherine)
                         You wanna cuppa coffee?

               Marty has followed Thomas out into the living room.

                                     MARTY
                         Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?

                                     THOMAS
                         Sure, great if you ain't married.

               Thomas goes out the door onto the porch. Marty stands in the 
               open doorway. He looks out into the warm sunshine in the 
               front yard.

                                     MARTY
                         Hi, Virginia.

               He goes out into the yard to Virginia. He is as gay as a 
               bird. He takes the baby from Virginia's arms, holds it high 
               up above him.

                                     MARTY
                              (to baby)
                         Hey, little boy, you sure getting 
                         fat. You weigh more than a side-a 
                         beef now.
                              (beams at the baby)
                         Hey, Thomas, so I was telling you 
                         yesterday you was over my house -- 
                         Mr. Gazzara, my boss, so he wantsa 
                         sell his shop, go out to California 
                         because his kids are all married, 
                         and he...

               Thomas hasn't been listening to Marty and crosses quickly to 
               Virginia.

                                     THOMAS
                         Wadda you so sore about?

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?

               Marty comes up to them, holding the baby.

                                     MARTY
                         So Thomas, he does about twelve, 
                         thirteen hundred gross. Rent's a 
                         hundred and two. The problem, of 
                         course, is the supermarkets. That's 
                         what I wanna ask you. If I get 
                         together with a coupla other 
                         merchants, make our own supermarket...

               Thomas has been trying to listen to Marty, but his thoughts 
               are all with his own problem. He whirls on Virginia.

                                     THOMAS
                         What about the time she wanted to 
                         make an old-fashioned Italian dinner 
                         for my brother, but you wouldn't let 
                         her!?

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (with her own temper)
                         Waddaya talking about?!!

                                     THOMAS
                         Once a month you couldn't let her 
                         use the kitchen!

                                     VIRGINIA
                         I told her she could use the kitchen 
                         any time she wanted...

                                     THOMAS
                         ...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen 
                         alla time!

                                     VIRGINIA
                         She don't wanna use my pots and pans!

                                     MARTY
                         So Tommy...

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Waddaya want me to do, go out and 
                         buy a whole new setta pots and pans?!

               The baby in Marty's arms has started to cry a little.

                                     MARTY
                         Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because 
                         I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him 
                         know tomorrow. See, what I wanna 
                         know, Tom, if a buncha individual 
                         retail merchants get together, how 
                         does it operate? On individual mark-
                         ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm 
                         the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's 
                         the dairyman and grocer, so suppose 
                         I mark up thirty-five percent, but 
                         he works on forty, so...

                                     THOMAS
                         Waddaya talking about, do you know 
                         what you're talking about?

                                     MARTY
                         No, I don't know. That's why I'm 
                         asking you.

               The baby starts to cry again. Thomas turns to his wife.

                                     THOMAS
                         Take the baby, will you?!

               Virginia hurries over and takes the crying baby from Marty's 
               arms, walks around comforting the child. Thomas turns back 
               to Marty.

                                     THOMAS
                         Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will 
                         you tell me? You gotta good job, you 
                         got no wife, you got no 
                         responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was 
                         you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself 
                         down with a shop? What's he want? 
                         Five thousand down? You're gonna 
                         have to carry a mortgage sixty, 
                         seventy bucks a month. A mortgage 
                         anna note from the bank. For Pete's 
                         sake, you're a single man with no 
                         responsibilities. Stay that way, 
                         boy. Take my advice.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, you see, Thomas I figure the 
                         big problem is the supermarkets. But 
                         Patsy's shop, that's a specialized 
                         trade. The supermarkets don't carry 
                         Italian meat.

                                     THOMAS
                         Who buys Italian meat anymore? You 
                         think my wife buys Italian meat?
                              (throws a baleful 
                              glance at his wife)
                         She goes to the A&P, picks up some 
                         lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, 
                         opens up a canna peas, and that's 
                         dinner, boy.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy 
                         stuff your mother makes.

               Marty is a little taken aback by Thomas's frontal assault.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, I understand the problem about 
                         the supermarkets, but I was talking 
                         to this girl last night, and she 
                         made the point that a likeable 
                         personality is a valuable business 
                         asset.

                                     THOMAS
                         Marty, see that my mother is nice 
                         and comfortable, eh?

                                     MARTY
                         Sure. This girl said...

                                     THOMAS
                         What girl, what does she know?
                              (he whirls on his 
                              wife again)
                         Why don't you let her hold the baby 
                         once in a while?! Your mother, boy, 
                         she wantsa take the kid for a day, 
                         that's fine!

                                     VIRGINIA
                              (her temper flaring 
                              again)
                         Your mother handles the kid like he 
                         was a yoyo!

               Marty stands, watching the young couple yakking at each other. 
               The little baby starts to cry again.

               KITCHEN.

               The two old sisters sit at the kitchen table, two untouched 
               cups of coffee in front of them.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Hey, I come home from your house 
                         last night, Marty was here with a 
                         girl.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Who?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Marty.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Your son Marty?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Well, what Marty you think is gonna 
                         be here in this house with a girl?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Were the lights on?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Oh sure.
                              (frowns at her sister)
                         This girl is a college graduate.

                                     CATHERINE
                         They're the worst. College girls are 
                         one step from the streets. They smoke 
                         like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, 
                         his wife, you know, she types onna 
                         typewriter. One step from the streets, 
                         I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders 
                         this philosophy for a moment.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         That's the first time Marty ever 
                         brought a girl to this house. She 
                         seems like a nice girl. I think he 
                         has a feeling for this girl. You 
                         heard him sing. He been singing like 
                         that all morning.

               Catherine nods bleakly.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Well, that's all. You will see. Today, 
                         tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say 
                         to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being 
                         a single man. I'm tired-a running 
                         around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, 
                         Ma, wadda we need this old house? 
                         Why don't we sell this old house, 
                         move into a nicer parta town? A nice 
                         little apartment?"

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't sell this house, I tell you 
                         that. This is my husband's house. I 
                         had six children in this house.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You will see. A coupla months, you 
                         gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna 
                         couch in her daughter-in-law's house.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. 
                         Wherever you are, the rain follows. 
                         Someday, you gonna smile, and we 
                         gonna declare a holiday.

               Marty comes in from the living room, a little down after his 
               session with Thomas and Virginia.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting 
                         a little late.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Sure.

               Marty goes to the sink to get himself a glass of water. He 
               examines a piece of plaster that has fallen from the ceiling.

                                     MARTY
                         Boy, this place is really coming to 
                         pieces.
                              (turning to his mother)
                         You know, Ma, I think we oughta sell 
                         this place. The whole joint's going 
                         to pieces. The plumbing is rusty. 
                         Everything. I'm gonna have to 
                         replaster the whole ceiling now. You 
                         know what we oughta do? We oughta 
                         get one of those new apartments 
                         they're building down on Southern 
                         Boulevard. A nicer parta town, you 
                         know?...You all set, Ma?

               Mrs. Pilletti exchanges a brief frightened glance with her 
               sister.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I'm all set.

               She sends another frightened look at her sister and follows 
               Marty out into the living room.

               MARTY'S PORCH.

               Marty, his mother, Thomas and Virginia with the baby file 
               down the porch to the street on their way to church. Marty 
               and his mother are both troubled. The anger has left both 
               Thomas and Virginia, but they are both silent. At the far 
               end of the alleyway, as they reach the street, Virginia puts 
               her free arm through her husband's elbow. Thomas looks briefly 
               at her and they exchange a look of commiseration. Everyone 
               turns and disappears off into the street.

               CHURCH.

               A HIGH, WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the church establishes that stage 
               of Sunday morning between the nine and ten o'clock masses. 
               People flock around the doors of the church.

               INSIDE THE CHURCH.

               The parishioners are making their ways to the door. A few 
               silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long empty 
               rows of pews. The large, almost empty church is filled now 
               with organ MUSIC.

               Both Marty and his mother seem a little depressed as they 
               stand at the doorway just inside the church, as the nine 
               o'clock mass people flow out, and the first of the ten o'clock 
               mass people file in.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         That was a nice girl last night, 
                         Marty.
                              (Marty nods)
                         She wasn't a very good-looking girl, 
                         but she looks like a nice girl.
                              (she pauses, Marty 
                              makes no reply)
                         I said, she wasn't a very good-looking 
                         girl... not very pretty...

                                     MARTY
                              (still amiable)
                         I heard you, Ma.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She looks a little old for you. About 
                         thirty-five, forty years old?

                                     MARTY
                         She's twenty-nine, Ma.

               A nearby kneeling penitent looks disapprovingly at Mrs. 
               Pilletti and shushes her. The mother nods briefly.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She's more than twenty-nine years 
                         old, Marty. That's what she tells 
                         you.

                                     MARTY
                         What, Ma?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She looks thirty-five, forty. She 
                         didn't look Italian to me.

               Marty frowns but remains silent.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I said, is she Italian girl?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know. I don't think so.

               It's Mrs. Pilletti's turn to frown. A silence. She turns 
               back to Marty.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She don't look Italian to me. What 
                         kinda family she come from? There 
                         was something about her I didn't 
                         like. It seems funny, the first time 
                         you meet her, she comes to your empty 
                         house alone. These college girls, 
                         they all one step fromma streets.

               Marty turns, on the verge of anger with his mother.

                                     MARTY
                         What are you talking about? She's a 
                         nice girl.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         She didn't look Italian to me.

               A silence hangs between them.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't like her.

                                     MARTY
                         You don't like her. You only met her 
                         for two minutes.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         Don't bring her to the house no more.

                                     MARTY
                         What didn't you like about her?

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         I don't know! She don't look like 
                         Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian 
                         girls around.

                                     MARTY
                         Well, let's not get inna fight about 
                         it, Ma.

               The kneeling woman shushes them again. By now the nine o'clock 
               worshipers have filed out, and Marty joins the flow of ten 
               o'clock people moving in. His mother turns back to him again.

                                     MARTY
                              (stopping her before 
                              she gets started)
                         What are you getting so worked up 
                         about? I just met the girl last night. 
                         I'm probably not gonna see her again.

               They continue down the aisle of the church.

               BAR. DAY.

               An hour later, the after-mass CROWD is there. It's a little 
               more crowded than weekdays. A WOMAN with a glass of beer in 
               one hand, rocks a baby carriage with the other.

               Marty enters the bar, moves along, ad-libbing "Hello" to 
               someone at the bar, gets the attention of Lou, the bartender.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?

                                     BARTENDER
                         He was here last night till about 
                         two o'clock. I hear you really got 
                         stuck with a dog last night.

                                     MARTY
                              (glancing quickly at 
                              him)
                         Who told you that?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Angie. He says she was a real scrawny-
                         looking thing.

                                     MARTY
                         She wasn't so bad.

               He turns away from the bar annoyed, notes Ralph, sitting 
               alone in one of the booths, reading the Sunday comics. Marty 
               ambles over to him.

                                     MARTY
                         Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out 
                         with those nurses last night, Ralph?

                                     RALPH
                              (looking up)
                         Oh man, you shoulda come with us 
                         last night, Marty. That one for you 
                         was a real lunatic. How'd you make 
                         out?

               The abruptness of the question rather startles Marty. It is 
               not an expression he would normally associate with an evening 
               with Clara.

                                     MARTY
                         Oh, I hadda nice time...I didn't try 
                         nothing. She's a nice girl. I just 
                         met her last night, you know. I just 
                         talked with her. I didn't even try 
                         nothing...

               He feels very ill at ease and a little guilty for defending 
               himself.

                                     MARTY
                         Listen, you see Angie, tell him I 
                         went home, I'll meet him after lunch.

               He moves back down the bar and goes out into the street.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MARTY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM. AFTERNOON

               Marty is seated at the dining room table. He has removed his 
               jacket, tie and shirt, even his shoes, and is making himself 
               comfortable over a late Sunday lunch. With him are Angie and 
               Joe, the Critic. Lounging in a chair but not at the table is 
               Leo.

                                     JOE
                         ...so the whole book winds up, Mike 
                         Hammer, he's inna room there with 
                         this doll. So he says, "You rat, you 
                         are the murderer." So she begins to 
                         con him, you know? She tells him how 
                         she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots 
                         her in the stomach. So she's laying 
                         there, gasping for breath, and she 
                         says, "How could you do that?" And 
                         he says, "It was easy."

                                     LEO
                              (without looking up 
                              from his magazine)
                         Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he 
                         can write.

               Angie reaches over to Marty's plate and filches a piece of 
               rissole, evidently annoying Marty.

                                     MARTY
                         We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We 
                         give you a plate-a your own.

                                     ANGIE
                         Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother 
                         just stuffed me right up to the jaws.

               This doesn't prevent him from filching a second piece of 
               rissole.

                         What I like about Mickey Spillane is 
                         he knows how to handle women. In one 
                         book, he picks up a tomato who gets 
                         hit with a car, and she throws a 
                         pass at him. And then he meets two 
                         beautiful twins, and they throw passes 
                         at him. And then he meets some 
                         beautiful society leader, and she 
                         throws a pass at him, and...

                         can write.

                         Listen, somebody turn onna ballgame. 
                         It must be after one o'clock by now.

               Marty looks down at his watch, then stands and starts for 
               the phone, sitting on a chest of drawers at the other end of 
               the room.

                         I was gonna call that girl from last 
                         night. Take her to a movie tonight.

                         Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you 
                         were very impolite last night. I 
                         introduced you to the girl, you just 
                         turned and walked off. Now, why did 
                         you do that?

                                     ANGIE
                         You got me mad, that's why. Hey, 
                         Joe, show Marty that picture.

               Joe, having finished his dissertation on Mickey Spillane, is 
               now studying another girlie magazine. He proffers an opened 
               page to Marty, who stands over by the phone.

                         Put that away, for Pete's sake. My 
                         mother's right out onna porch.

                                     JOE
                         I wonder where they find those girls 
                         that pose for them pictures.

                                     LEO
                         Those are Hollywood starlets.

                         Put it away, Joe. My mother'll come 
                         walking in.

               Joe closes the magazine.

                         I don't feel like going, Angie. I 
                         thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

                                     ANGIE
                         Boy, you really musta made out good 
                         last night.

                                     MARTY
                         We just talked.

                                     ANGIE
                         Boy, she musta been some talker. She 
                         musta been about fifty years old.

                         I always figure a guy oughta marry a 
                         girl who's twenny years younger than 
                         he is so that when he's forty, his 
                         wife is a real nice-looking doll.

                                     LEO
                         That means he'd have to marry the 
                         girl when she was one year old.

                                     JOE
                         I never thoughta that.

                         I didn't think she was so bad-looking.

                         She musta kept you inna shadows all 
                         night.

                         Marty, you don't wanna hang around 
                         with dogs. It gives you a bad 
                         reputation.

                         I told this dog I was gonna call her 
                         today about two-thirty.

                                     ANGIE
                              (angry)
                         Brush her. Listen, you wanna come 
                         with me tonight, or you wanna go 
                         with this dog?

                                     MARTY
                         Waddaya getting so sore about?

                                     ANGIE
                         I looked all over for you last night, 
                         you know that?

               He turns away sulking. Marty doesn't pick up the phone but 
               returns to his seat, upset.

                                     JOE
                         Another book that I read by Mickey 
                         Spillane, I can't remember the name 
                         of it, but it was about this red-
                         headed tramp he finds inna street, 
                         and he gives her some dough, because 
                         he's sorry for her... Wait a minute, 
                         I think that's the same book I was 
                         telling you about before...

                                     MARTY
                              (to Angie)
                         You didn't like her at all?

                                     ANGIE
                         A nothing. A real nothing.

               Marty lowers his head. Over this, Joe's VOICE DRONES on.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         You know something...?

               CAMERA ANGLE HOLDS on Marty looking down, as Joe's VOICE 
               continues.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         ...I can't tell one-a those Mickey 
                         Spillane books from the other, but 
                         he's a real good writer, though...

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               SNYDER APARTMENT. NIGHT

               CLOSE ON television screen. Ed Sullivan is on, indicating 
               the time is a little after half past seven. CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK, disclosing Clara, Mr. and Mrs. Snyder in their living 
               room. Apparently the Sullivan show is very funny at the 
               moment, for the television audience roars with laughter. 
               CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON Clara. Another ROAR of LAUGHTER 
               from the television that Clara watches, although her eyes 
               are flooded with tears, several of which have already traced 
               wet paths down her cheeks. Another ROAR of laughter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. NIGHT.

               Marty, Mrs. Pilletti and Catherine are eating silently at 
               the table. Catherine reads an Italian newspaper as she eats.

                                     MRS. PILLETTI
                         So what are you gonna do tonight, 
                         Marty?

                                     MARTY
                         I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked 
                         out. I think I'll just hang arounna 
                         house and watch...

               Suddenly he pauses, sharply aware of the repetition in his 
               life. Mrs. Pilletti is also aware of it.

                                     MARTY
                         Maybe, I'll go out and see what Angie 
                         and the boys are doing...

               They eat silently a moment.

               187TH STREET. BAR. NIGHT.

               CLOSE-UP of Marty leaning against the wall in front of the 
               bar. A group of young men lounge about, killing time.

               Angie, Leo and Joe are among them. There are perhaps four or 
               five other young MEN, loosely divided into two groups. The 
               group that concerns us has Marty and the others mentioned 
               and GEORGE, a young man in a sport jacket.

                         and the whole evening's gone.

                         What's playing on Fordham Road? I 
                         think there's a good picture in the 
                         Loew's Paradise.

                                     GEORGE
                         You guys feel like working up a game-
                         a cards?

                         Street, walk around. We're sure to 
                         wind up with something.

               CLOSE-UP of Marty, his head down, his eyes closed. The group 
               continues their dialogue back and forth. Their VOICES can be 
               heard as Marty's head slowly comes up.

                                     JOE'S VOICE

                         cutting out burlesque outta New York 
                         City...

                         I feel like playing cards. I saw 
                         Richie Rizzo, that's what he said he 
                         felt like doing...

                         like doing?

               A fury rises in Marty's face. He cries out at them.

                                     MARTY
                         "What are you doing tonight?"... "I 
                         don't know, what are you doing?!"...

               CAMERA ANGLES over to the others who, at this outburst, stare 
               at Marty astounded.

                                     MARTY
                              (continuing)
                         The burlesque! Loew's Paradise! 
                         Miserable and lonely! Miserable and

                         here! What am I hanging around with 
                         you guys for?!

               He has said this in tones so loud that it attracts the 
               attention of the few PEOPLE on the street. A little 
               embarrassed by the attention he's getting, he turns, opens 
               the door to the bar, and goes into it.

               After a stunned moment, Angie hurries after him.

               INSIDE THE BAR.

               Marty marches the length of the room toward the phone booths 
               in the rear. CAMERA ANGLES to disclose Angie right behind 
               him.

               Marty is about to enter one of the phone booths, but he stops 
               as Angie hurries up to him.

                                     ANGIE
                         Watsa matter with you?

               Marty pauses, one foot in the booth.

                                     MARTY
                         You don't like her. My mother don't 
                         like her. She's a dog, and I'm a 
                         fat, ugly little man. All I know is 
                         I hadda good time last night. I'm 
                         gonna have a good time tonight. If 
                         we have enough good times together, 
                         I'm gonna go down on my knees and 
                         beg that girl to marry me. If we 
                         make a party again this New Year's, 
                         I gotta date for the party. You don't 
                         like her, that's too bad.

               Marty has been fishing in his pocket for his address book. 
               He opens it to its proper page and steps decisively into the 
               phone booth.

               Nearby, Angie prowls around outside the booth. The booth 
               door is open. Marty starts to dial. A hush fills the room 
               except for the CLICKING of the telephone dial.

               INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH.

               The look of fury has drained from Marty's face. He holds the 
               receiver to his ear, glances out toward Angie. CAMERA ANGLES 
               to include Angie.

                                     MARTY
                              (his old amiable self)
                         When you gonna get married, Angie? 
                         Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're 
                         thirty-three years old. All your kid 
                         brothers are married. You oughta be 
                         ashamed of yourself.

               Still smiling at his very private joke, Marty returns to the 
               phone, and after a fraction of a second...

                                     MARTY
                         Hello... Clara?...

               As Angie looks miserable, and Marty slowly reaches out and 
               pushes the phone booth door shut, and continues to talk into 
               the phone, we very slowly...

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD



                        Written by

                 John Collee & Peter Weir




   1. THE OCEAN - DUSK

   From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,
   abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided
   valleys of water.

   Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the
   ocean and an adjacent coastline.

   In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a
   small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering
   darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.

   2. THE SHIP - DUSK

   [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a
   man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her
   great guns projecting from every gun-port.

   As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is
   visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.

   3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

   The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:

           HMS Surprise
           Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.
           Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806
           Mission: Intercept and destroy French
           Privateer, Acheron


   5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

   CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the
   table, studying charts.

   His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of
   indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.

   JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops
   below the great casement windows.

   KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and
   retires.
                    JACK
          (Absently) Thankee Killick

   4. THE CHARTS:

   a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.

   Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,
   bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then
   another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.

   On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and
   detailed information in fine copperplate script:

          6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks
          (exact position unknown). Hidden reef.

   6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

   Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his
   pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running
   from brow to chin.

   He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out.

7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT

Dr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk
surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific
instruments.

[   ]

TOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but
the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced
structure, is too engrossed to notice him.

8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT

In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from
an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.

PETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about
whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth
mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to
resume.

                    BLAKENEY
          In
                      CALAMY
          Out.

                    BLAKENEY
          In. It was here. The line is in.

                    CALAMY
          It was there. It was out. Out

                    BLAKENEY
          In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.

The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much
older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a
sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing
up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.

9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT

By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few
of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.

Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down
greedily

One man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD
DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first
link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.

JOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in
the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling
their foreheads in deference to the officer.

10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT

Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of
'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the
powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns
during action.

11.    BERTH DECK - NIGHT

A hundred hammocks swing like strange pods, close packed
under the immense beams. Most of the occupants are already
asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head

                    HOLLAR
          Lights out!

On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb
into their hammocks.

The last lights are extinguished. Only PULLINGS' lamp
remains, moving up the ladder to...

12.   WEATHER DECK - NIGHT

The uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel
gangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck
(aft).

The lead is dropped from the bows. As PULLINGS walks aft to
the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea
line.

                     CREWMEN
           Watch there! Watch

Somewhere a bell sounds and the silent figures of the watch
call from their stations.

                     WATCH CAPTAINS
           - Lifebuoy all's well!
           - Starboard gangway all's well!
           - Starboard bow all's well!

Over this, the splash of the lead and the repeated cry of
"Watch there! Watch!"

13.     QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

Pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant
MOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.

JACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first
time: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair
clubbed at the back

At the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,
BONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK
their current course.

JACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS. Jack
sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice.

                     JACK
           How I do hate a lee shore

                     PULLINGS
           You think we'll have long to wait?
                    JACK
              (shrugs)
          Intelligence reports had her leaving
          Boston on the 12th, that should put us at
          least a week ahead.

                    PULLINGS
          She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.

The pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but JACK
lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense,
expectant silence.

                    JACK
          In for a "Surprise". Now that's wit. "In
          for a Surprise". 'Pon my word I shall
          have to tell the Doctor.

He leaves, still laughing. Those on the quarterdeck are more
amused by JACK's unique sense of humour than by the feeble
joke itself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (calls back)
          Don't put her on the reef, Tom.

                    PULLINGS
          I'll try not to, Sir.

13A    INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN

Jack looks around the door

                    JACK
          What do you have there, Stephen?

He enters. Stephen has wired together the thorax of a bird's
skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it

                    STEPHEN
          The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you
          remark its prodigious strength.

Jack bends forwards into the candle-light, sharing his
friends keen interest in this strange assembly

                    JACK
          I do and I am not in the least surprised,
          for it reminds me of nothing so much as a
          ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.
          Here the mast, and here the backstays
          running aft.

                    STEPHEN
              (adds another weight)
          Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing
          a paper for the Royal Society.

Jack straightens, moving with care between the bottled
specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments

                    JACK
          I was thinking when our business here is
          finished, we will have to put in to
          Recife for provisions. You may care to
          take a tour round the forests of Brazil,
          botanizing and collecting specimens. An
          anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.

                    STEPHEN
          I should like it of all things, Jack.
          Thankyou.


14.     WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Time passes. The fog intensifies. White coils of mist drift
and eddy over the glassy sea, RUN FINAL TITLES as the ship
moves slowly through the night.

15-16   (ADDED TO SC 12)

17.     IN THE GREAT CABIN, LATER - NIGHT

The chronometer ticks. The coffee-pot swings on its gimbals.
JACK lies awake in his hanging cot. Finally he gives up
trying to sleep.

                    JACK
          Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee,
          and light along my topcoat.

18.     ON THE QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK on deck again.

                    QUARTERMASTER
          Six bells and all's well.

A hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift
as an offshore breeze picks up.
                    LEAD-MAN
          90 fathoms, white shelly sand.

                    CALAMY
          Four knots, Sir.

BONDEN is still at the wheel.

                    BONDEN
          Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you
          feels like putting your éad down.

JACK takes his advice and goes below again.

19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE)

The sky a shade paler. A wind coming up.

20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN

The lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist.

                    VINCENT
          Starboard gangway ahoy.

HOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is,
appears at his shoulder.

                    HOLLOM
          What is it, Vincent?

                    VINCENT
          I heard something. A bell.

HOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns.

                    HOLLOM
          Native fisherman perhaps.
          (shouts) Mr. Calamy!

Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          The lead, if you please.

Young CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the
bow of the ship and throws out the lead line.

HOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies
of fog.
Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth.

                     CALAMY (O.S.)
           Sixty fathoms, white sand!

Hollom folds his telescope

                     HOLLOM
           Well. It can't have been a reef marker.

CALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope

                     HOLLOM (CONT'D)
           False alarm Mr CALAMY

CALAMY ignores him, still scanning

21.   TELESCOPE POV

The telescope pans. A dark shape in the distance. The mist
parts a little. A ship. Coming straight toward them.

Close on CALAMY as he turns to camera, screaming -

                     CALAMY
           Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to
           quarters!

22. JACK'S SLEEP CABIN

JACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed.

23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN

A drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their
hammocks and run to their battle stations.

24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK

Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the
operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws,
retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light.

DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he
ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant
surgeon.

25.   POWDER MAGAZINE

Little ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their
boxes of gunpowder to the...

26. GUN-DECK

As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin
partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single
continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin
in the stern.

As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are
thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle-
lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene.

27. WEATHER-DECK

JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the
bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while
others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to
be towed behind the ship.

28. FORECASTLE

JACK and PULLINGS join HOLLOM.

                    JACK
          Where away?

CALAMY points forward and a little to the left of the
Surprise's bow.

                    CALAMY
          Not two miles distant, Sir.

JACK and PULLINGS stare through telescopes into the fog,
which is beginning to lift. JACK lowers his telescope.

                    JACK
          Mr. Hollom?

                    HOLLOM
          I saw nothing, nor heard anything either.
          Shall I ask them men to stand down?

JACK steps closer to the bow, and again lifts his telescope.

29. TELESCOPE P.O.V

A slow pan across the sea, past a darker patch of fog. What
was that? The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a
series of flashes.
30. CLOSE ON JACK

He turns and shouts to the crew -

                     JACK
           Lie down! Everybody lie down!

His words are underscored by a series of distant explosions,
followed by a deep rumble, then a tearing, howling sound.

31. ANGLE ON THE SKY

Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the
air. A blizzard of iron.

32. ON THE DECK

The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is BONDEN hanging
grimly to the wheel.

33. MIDSHIPMAN BLAKENEY

Close, as he tries to bury himself in the deck timbers.

34. DELETED

35. DELETED.

36. QUARTERDECK

The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and
metal scythes the length of the deck at head height. This is
rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now
burning on the forecastle.

CALAMY is working at putting the fire out as JACK issues a
stream of orders.

                     JACK
           Run out the guns! Marines to the tops,
           and get that wounded man below!

He pulls a gold watch from his pocket and checks the time.

36A.   GUN DECK

Hollom is nervously supervising a gun crew which includes
DAVIES and his mates.
                     HOLLOM
           ...C-cast loose now... Um swab. That's
           right. Run out your guns.

The men work as a team, largely ignoring Hollom's hesitant
instructions. The shot rack is empty

                     DAVIES
           Shot. There's no shot!

37.   QUARTERDECK (CONTD)

As red-coated marines led by Captain HOWARD climb into the
rigging JACK calls to his clerk -

                     JACK
           Note the time Mr. Watt.

An anxious TOM PULLINGS appears.

                     PULLINGS
           She's out of our range, Sir!

JACK calls to his sailing master, ALLEN.

                     JACK
           Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me
           alongside her at pistol-shot.

ALLEN purses his lips. He knows what he's doing and slightly
resents the instruction

                     JACK (CONT'D)
           Mr. Pullings - bow-chasers to fire as she
           bears.

38. P.O.V. ENEMY SHIP

She's crossing their bows, about a mile distant.

39. ON DECK

PULLINGS is racing up the larboard gangway to the forecastle,
past men stacking hammocks as blast protection.

40. ON THE FORECASTLE

Gun-captains stand ready, the slow-match burning in the tubs.

                     PULLINGS
           Fire on the uproll.

The little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on PULLINGS' face.
The ship rolls.

                       PULLINGS (CONT'D)
           Fire!

The drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns.

The smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls
bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship.

                     OLD SPONGE
               (In Greek)
           Witchcraft!

                     DOUDLE
           Never seen the like of it

                     PULLINGS
           Damn and blast you! See to your guns!
           Fire high! Fire for the masts and
           rigging!

As the enemy's murderous long guns run out again.

41.   WIDE ON THE ENEMY SHIP

Her French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on
to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a
series of red flashes.

42.   IN THE COCKPIT

By the dim light of a battle-lantern STEPHEN struggles to
hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools
of blood on the deck.

                     STEPHEN
           More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!

The slightly hung-over HIGGINS reaches for the sand bucket
and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the
Acheron's third broadside hits home.

43.   IN THE GREAT CABIN -

The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing
freely, stows what he can.
44.   IN THE ORLOP

Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water
knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for
the ladder carrying two cannon-balls.

A second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding
his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter.

                       DAVIES
             Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!

45. STAIRS

Follow DAVIES as he runs up to the gun-deck with the shot
under his arms past the powder-monkeys ADDISON and SWIFT,
canisters of gun-powder slung over their shoulders, then he
sees MR. LAMB, the carpenter.

                       DAVIES
             Orlop! We're holed!

As LAMB dives for the ladder.

46.   ON THE GUN-DECK

DAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own
gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or
dead.

The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around
dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against
the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm.

CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck
gaze and takes command.

                       CALAMY
             Davies! Get those bodies overboard!
                 (to HOLLOM)
             Mr. Hollom sir!

HOLLOM sits immobilized by fear. CALAMY grabs the poulterer,
JEMMY DUCKS, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia.

                       CALAMY (CONT'D)
             Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take
             Mr. Hollom below.

                        JEMMY DUCKS
           Aye, sir!

The ship heels as she turns.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles,
turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a
hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes
CALAMY against the bulkhead.

CALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft.
BLAKENEY carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys -

                     BLAKENEY
           More shot! More cartridge!

47.   HULL OF THE SURPRISE

In the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was
destroyed, JACK stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained
figure. He glances back at his men, hunched and ready,
itching to fire.

                     JACK (bellows)
           Steady... Wait for it!

48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE

to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise
heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north.

The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both
come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums.
They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart.

49.   GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

JACK watching the enemy, judging the moment.

                     JACK
           ...wait WAIT! And FIRE!

The great guns go off all together. The cannons leaping back
between their crews. JACK snatches a powder-monkey, ADDISON,
out of the way of the lethal recoil.

50.   QUARTERDECK

Smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a
bowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have
failed to penetrate the enemy timbers.
                     BONDEN
           By all that's holy what is that ship made
           of?

His question coincides with a third full broadside from the
Frenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown
aside, MR. WATT jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast
hit.

A rope sheers and JOE PLAICE is smacked on the skull by a
swinging boom.

Midshipman BLAKENEY, running up on deck, goes to help PLAICE
and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking wound to
his upper right arm.

51. COMPANIONWAY

JACK is half-way up the ladder when he falls, scored across
the forehead by a musket-ball.

Eyesight blurred. Hearing gone. He is dimly aware of small
arms cracking above his head, and someone trying to lift him.

                     JACK
           Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!

                     MOWETT
           You must go below, Sir, you must let me
           help you below!

JACK puts a hand to his bleeding forehead and drags himself
back up the ladder.

52. IN THE TOPS

A furious exchange of fire between CAPTAIN HOWARD's marines
and the sharpshooters in the enemy's rigging.

Howard, a big red-faced man, is in his element, laughing
madly every time he scores a hit.

53. QUARTERDECK

JACK emerges into bloody chaos: screams of the wounded all
around, the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun-smoke.

He wipes blood from his eye as he raises his telescope.

54/55.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.
As the ship passes, her name is visible on the transom -
Acheron.

                     PULLINGS V.O
           Sir....

Jack lowers his telescope. Pullings' expression spells
catastrophe

                     PULLINGS
           It's the rudder.

56.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Grim-faced, JACK hobbles to the shattered taff-rail, sees
BONDEN soaked, having climbed down onto the stern-post.

                     BONDEN
               (shouts up)
           It's shot away below the waterline!


58. COCKPIT

STEPHEN, up to his armpits in blood, operating on a wounded
man, looks up to see three more seriously injured men
arriving.

He pauses, aware of some change.

                     STEPHEN
           Why are we not firing?


57.   GUN-DECK

Spirals of drifting smoke. Blackened bleeding men, their guns
pointing at nothing


                     FASTER DOUDLE
           No steerage.

                     NEHEMIAH SLADE
           We're fish in a barrel



59.   HIGH SHOT
The fog has rolled back, like a great curtain, to reveal the
two frigates.

The badly damaged Surprise, drifting rudderless.

The Acheron, most of her sails intact, beginning the turn
which will put her in position to finish off the Surprise.

60. QUARTERDECK

JACK is joined by ALLEN as the enemy vessel starts crossing
their wake.

                     ALLEN
           He's coming about, Sir.

                     MOWETT
           Should I strike the colours?

All eyes on Jack, poised on the brink of awful defeat.

                     ALLEN
           I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.

JACK looks from the wall of fog to the three little boats
they are towing astern.

                     JACK
           Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.

61.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE

Sudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men
scramble down into the boats. DAVIES settles himself beside
NAGEL in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching
Acheron.

His P.O.V.: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers.

                     PULLINGS
           Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what
           sail you can!

                     JACK
           Stern-chasers to fire when she's in
           range!

62.   STERN OF SURPRISE

Gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards
from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the
boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the
bows as....


64.   MAINMAST/FOREMAST

Men scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered
rigging.

65.   THE GREAT CABIN

Two long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows
of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching
Acheron.

                        MOWETT
           Fire!

65A. MAINMAST

WARLEY, captain of the maintop, directs his men about the
mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill
with what little breeze there is.

                     WARLEY
           Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the
           clew line from the reef points, Cully,
           double up and run her back again!

66. QUARTERDECK

Through PULLINGS' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight
at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise.

                     PULLINGS
           She's gaining on us.

                     JACK
           Start the water, carronades over the
           side.

67.   ANGLE ON THE QUARTERDECK

Crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns
on the quarterdeck.

68.   ANGLE ON THE STERN

Water spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the
quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean.
(NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their
main armament on the gun-deck.)

69. FORECASTLE

JACK races to the bows. Towlines strain as the three small
boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and
cloud. He yells to the straining oarsmen -

                     JACK
           Pull! Pull for your lives.

70.   ANGLE FROM THE BOATS

The men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the
towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the
safety of the fog-bank.

71. WIDE

to see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low
cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear.

72. QUARTERDECK

JACK joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in
the direction of the enemy.

                     JACK
           Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr.
           ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to
           head due east.

ALLEN hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is
momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their
pursuer.

73.   THE LEADING JOLLY BOAT

CALAMY, in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees ALLEN on the
ship, signalling the turn to eastward.

CALAMY signals to BONDEN in the stern of the jolly-boat.

                     BONDEN
               (urgent whisper)
           Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!

One side stops rowing and the boat turns.
74.   THE SURPRISE

A low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us.

Beyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship
rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on
their backs.

75.   QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE

Somewhere astern and to the left JACK can hear shouting on
the Acheron. Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them.

                     PULLINGS
           He's beating inshore.

                     JACK
           Keep rowing

76 MASTS OF THE SURPRISE, (TIMELAPSE) - NIGHT

The tortured sounds of exhausted men rowing as skeins of mist
drift away to reveal a dim, yellow moon. On the horizon the
battered ship in silhouette, lines stretching ahead to her
three small boats.

77 QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Some of the wreckage has been cleared aside, the wounded
moved below. We can hear their moans, and the constant
creaking of the bilge pumps.

JACK and his officers scan the moonlit sea through
telescopes.

JACK's telescope POV: A long slow pan along the dark horizon.

                     ALLEN
           I believe we've lost her, Sir.

JACK collapses his telescope.

                     JACK
           Pass the word to ship oars


78 IN THE JOLLY BOATs. - NIGHT

The rowers slump forwards in their seats, their hands raw and
crabbed.
79 STAIRWELL - NIGHT

JACK moves down a ladder past LAMB coming up from below,
soaking wet and exhausted with his mate Nagel.

                    LAMB
          Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but
          the pumps are keeping it from gaining.

                    JACK
          Very good, Mr. Lamb.

The constant creaking and sloshing of the pumps becomes
louder as he continues down past men handing up food and
powder from the flooded levels below.

81. SICK-BAY

Stephen, his face spattered with blood, is adjusting the wick
of a lantern when Jack arrives beside him

                    JACK
              (sotto)
          What's the butchers bill?

                    STEPHEN
          Six dead, thirteen wounded.

He notices the gash on Jack's forehead

          Your head ...

                    JACK
              (Brushes him away)
          Later.

STEPHEN raises his lantern to reveal groaning bloodstained
men close-packed in the gloom.

Together they make the rounds, passing men propped upright by
their mates, pale with shock or tense with pain, some
struggling to breathe, some barely alive.

JACK clasps hands, whispers encouragement.

A bandaged head swims into the glow of the lamp, streaked
with blood and deeply unconscious.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Who's this - Joe Plaice?
                    STEPHEN
              (sotto)
          A severe depressed fracture of the
          skull. I am not sure he will see out the
          night.

Moving on to another barely recognizable face: young
Blakeney, pale and sweaty, breathing hard from the pain and
the blood loss.

                    JACK
          Mr. Blakeney?

                    BLAKENEY
          Just a broken arm, Sir.

JACK looks at STEPHEN, whose expression is grim, but he says
nothing, steering Jack forward to the foot of the ladder
where they can speak more privately

                    STEPHEN
          I will do everything possible. I know you
          were close to his father.

Jack nods, defeat weighing heavily, and makes to go. Stephen
puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          One moment Jack let me look at that brow
          of yours.

                    JACK
          Its a scratch.

                    STEPHEN
          I will tell you if its a scratch or not.
          Sit down.

Jack submits meekly, and sits on a lower rung while Stephen
puts a bandage round his forehead

                    JACK
          How did he find us Stephen?
          Seven weeks sailing and he happened in
          darkness on our exact position. Its
          uncanny. He really is a phantom

                    STEPHEN
          Unless she was alerted to our presence,
          and looking for us.
                    JACK
          Tosh. How could that be?

                    STEPHEN
          The French have their spies, in Britain
          as elsewhere.

                     JACK (astonished)
          You're saying there are traitors in the
          Admiralty?

                    STEPHEN
          I am saying do not imagine it was a lone
          privateer who did this to us. He is
          working for Napoleon himself, with access
          to all that tyrant commands, overtly and
          covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too
          heavily upon you.

82.    THE GREAT CABIN - DAWN

Wan dawn light reflects off the ceiling onto the bloody,
bandaged officers, conducting an angry post-mortem as KILLICK
serves coffee.

                    ALLEN
          ...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me
          she's no more a frigate than a painted
          Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a
          two-decker more'n a frigate.

MOWETT is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed.

                    MOWETT
          One does wonder what manner of hull she
          has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off
          her.

Jack enters, his head newly bandaged. He walks past the
seated officers and stands looking out through the stern
windows. The officers continue their conversation, though
their words are intended for Jack

                    PULLINGS
          She had the weather-gauge and long
          eighteens which could hit us beyond our
          effective range. That's the sum of it

                     ALLEN
          And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the
          muzzle flashes.

                    PULLINGS
          It was an unfair match, no dishonor in
          defeat no dishonor at all.

Jack still has his back to them. He puts his hand in his
pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of
his gold pocket watch.

                    ALLEN
              (sighs)
          Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen
          the foresail is too far gone so we'll
          bend our spare.

                      PULLINGS
          Sir.

Jack finally turns.

                    PULLINGS (CONT'D)
          Mr. Allen is confident, with basic
          repairs, we can get home as we are...
          allowing for a stop in Jamaica.

                     ALLEN
          At Port Royal we can haul her into dry-
          dock, and hopefully get her home
          without...

                    JACK
          We're not going home.

An expectant hush. KILLICK is all ears, as he picks up the
coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why
          were we sent? To punish a blackguard
          privateer who has decimated our Atlantic
          whaling fleet and now threatens to do the
          same in the pacific. Are we to leave
          those ships to his mercy and slink back
          into Portsmouth - another defeat to add
          to the list. Is that what we draw our
          wages for? I say we pursue her and pay
          her back with interest

                    ALLEN
          With respect, Captain, she could be half-
          way to Cape Horn by the time we're
           repaired and underway.

                     JACK
               (sternly)
           Then there's not a moment to lose.

83.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

KILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he
passes them to his mate, BLACK BILL -

                     KILLICK (a whisper)
           We're for the Horn.

84.     THROUGHOUT THE SHIP - DAWN

Word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to
the beak of the ship

                      MUTTERED VOICES AD LIB
           -   The Horn you say?
           -   Never! In this condition?
           -   Eh? What news mates
           -   Heading for where?!

85.     FORECASTLE - DAWN

A few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all
of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic
Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing
Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still
shaken by the loss of his gun-crew.

                     higgins
           We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you
           ask my opinion

                     slade
           I'm game. If the captain says we can take
           her we can take her.

                     DAVIES
           Can we catch her is the question.
           And if we do what's different? She'll
           just hold us off with them long eighteens
           til she sends us all to the bottom. All
           for what?

                     DOUDLE
           I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a
           privateer, loaded with all the gems of
           Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the
           prize-money.

                     HOLLAR
           Hoi there! You men jump to it!

86.     WAIST OF THE SHIP - NOON

The gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the
gun-deck.

87.     GUN-DECK - DAY

Part of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is
manhandled by a dozen crewmen.

                     HOLLAR
           Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One
           long pull. Belay!

88.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

Crewmen labour at the capstan.

                     HOLLAR (O.S.)
           Two six heave! Two six heave!

The huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its
gantry. JACK shouts down from the quarterdeck -

                     JACK
           Have her placed along the gunwale for
           now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to
           that side also.

89.   ABOVE JACK'S HEAD

Men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections
of rope.

                     FASTER DOUDLE
           All clear below!

90.     QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK dodges the falling rope, moving back, past NAGEL and his
men who are cutting out damaged sections of the gunwale with
saws and adzes, prizing up decking and wrestling with the
wrecked steering mechanism.

91.     THE STERN - DAY
JACK looks down to where PULLINGS and others have lifted the
broken rudder from its hinges.

92.    WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship swarming with men, cutting, splicing, hammering and
hauling. Every able-bodied soul hard at work.

93.    QUARTERDECK - DAY

An optimistic breeze has picked up, fluttering the tattered
ensign.

The deck is now sloping at a forty-five degree angle. KILLICK
hands a sandwich to Pullings who passes it down to JACK.

                    JACK
          Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron
          will be making a hundred and fifty miles
          a day in this.

                    PULLINGS
          Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping
          to board the odd merchantman

JACK smiles at this and bites into his sandwich.

To the uphill side, carpenters are erecting a scaffolding
over the side of the ship.

94.    THE SHIP - DAY

The ship's copper-plated keel is partly revealed as the men
clamber and slip about on the steeply-sloping side erecting
scaffolding. The tropical heat resounds with shouts, curses
and hammering.

95.    SIDE OF THE SHIP - DUSK

Carpenters working inside the scaffolding, are fitting new
sections of wood into the holes low in her hull.

                    LAMB
          Down. Down. Stop.

The new piece of wood is an almost perfect fit. MR. LAMB
marks the places where it is jamming.

                      LAMB (CONT'D)
          Up again.
Then he begins to work on it with his rasp.

96.    UNDERWATER - DUSK

Among tropical fish, a diver, a Greek crewman, 'OLD
SPONGE' (father of YOUNG SPONGE) a hammer at his belt, plugs
a few smaller holes with hemp fibre, then surfaces to...

97.    THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER - DUSK

                    OLD SPONGE
              (In Greek)
          The smaller bit. No. That bit there.

YOUNG SPONGE passes him a piece of lead and some nails and
OLD SPONGE dives again.

Our P.O.V. descending into the sea as...

98.    WAIST OF THE SHIP - NIGHT

Roaring flames, flying sparks, the clang of metal on metal. A
forge has been set up. Powder-monkeys sweat on the bellows.
The ship's blacksmith is churning out iron bolts, pintles and
gudgeons, which are snatched away by NAGEL with tongs and
thrown into a bucket of water to cool.

A few yards away, wood chips fly from LAMB's adze as the
ship's massive new stern post takes shape.

The new rudder is laid out flat, already cut to its final
shape and being strengthened with great nails and iron bands
which NEHEMIAH SLADE and AWKWARD DAVIES are nailing into
place.

The hammering travels through the ship to...

99.    THE SICK BERTH - NIGHT

BLAKENEY with his splinted arm jerks awake, feverish and
confused.

                    BLAKENEY
          No. No. Not through my nose!

                    CALAMY
          Its alright. William. You were dreaming.

Blakeney looks around, disoriented and finds Calamy by his
side.
                    BLAKENEY
          Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew
          you up in your hammock with the last
          stitch through your nose... to make sure
          you're not just sleeping

                    CALAMY
          You know old Joe, always telling [ ]
          stories.

                    BLAKENEY
          Is it true though? [    ] About the last
          stitch?

                    CALAMY
          Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine
          first.

                    BLAKENEY (drifting)
          Not through my nose. You'll tell them.

                     CALAMY
              (nods)
          Nor any other part of you.

Trying to make light of it, though he fears BLAKENEY is
dying.

100.       SICK BAY, LATER - NIGHT

CALAMY has fallen asleep by BLAKENEY's side. He wakes to find
STEPHEN sniffing BLAKENEY's wound.

                    CALAMY
          Is it mending, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          No, I'm afraid it will not do.

101.        THE COCKPIT - NIGHT

BLAKENEY is lowered onto the table, delirious. CALAMY holds
his head and PADEEN, MATURIN's giant manservant, his legs,
which are lashed together.

                    BLAKENEY
          No. Mamma. Mamma.

                    STEPHEN
          It is the laudanum speaking. You will be
          a regular Nelson.

He tests the edge of his knife with his thumb.

CALAMY places the leather gag between BLAKENEY's teeth.
Padeen mumbles a Gaelic prayer. STEPHEN turns and grips
BLAKENEY shattered arm.

A sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting
off the arm.

Close on STEPHEN, lips compressed, utterly focussed.

He puts down the bloody knife and reaches for the spatula in
the pail of hot tar.

BLAKENEY has not uttered a sound, though he is shaking
uncontrollably and his face is wet with tears. CALAMY has
tears in his eyes also.

STEPHEN finishes his work, breathing hard, a gentle smile to
BLAKENEY.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          There. I have never seen a braver
          patient.

102.        SICK-BERTH - NIGHT

An exhausted CALAMY keeps vigil by BLAKENEY's cot. The boy
wakes, and looks for CALAMY in the darkness.

                    BLAKENEY
          Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my
          arm off.

Then he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream

                    CALAMY
          You would have died else.

Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Come. You can still sup your grog with
          your left. And I shall take your turn at
          marbles.

103.        MIZZEN TOPGALLANT - DAY

MOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the
lashings round the new mizzen top. Below him the great work
is nearing completion, men swarming like ants over every part
of the hull.

MOWETT climbs down past FASTER DOUDLE who has one leg looped
through the shrouds and is splicing a rope with both hands
and his teeth.

Farther down, a patched sail is being furled up tight in its
gaskets.

Beyond that, at the base of the main-mast a fascinated group
of men have gathered to watch the Doctor trepanning JOE
PLAICE.

104.        BASE OF THE MAINMAST - DAY

STEPHEN's drill carves out a neat disc of bone to reveal a
purplish mass which he starts spooning from the cavity.

A small crowd of crewmen pause in their work, watching the
doctor with morbid fascination as he drops the purple stuff
in a dish.


                    SLADE (shouts)
          Is them his brains, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          No, that is just blood. These are his
          brains.

Exposing them to view. Several of the crew move in for a
closer look. The armourer hands STEPHEN a flattened coin,
which he begins to screw in place over the cavity as the old
hands whisper his praises to the men who have never seen
Stephen at work.

                    SLADE
          Physician he is, not one of your common
          surgeons.

                    FASTER DOUDLE
          Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and
          the strong fives, wouldn't look at you
          for under ten guineas on land.

                    DAVIES
          [   ] Knows his birds and beasts too
          boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell
          you what it's thinking.
105.           THE SURPRISE - DAY

A wind causes the ship to turn on its moorings, stirring
impatiently, like a racehorse ready to be off as...

106.           QUARTERDECK - DAY

...JACK jumps down from the mizzen ratlines.

                    JACK
          Let us be off, Mr. Allen!

                    ALLEN
          Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr
          Hollom!

107. ON DECK

Barefoot men are suddenly running to their stations, racing
above and below, running out along the bowsprit, up the
ratlines, along the yards.

A small group, supposed to be assisting Hollom, are
contrasting slow off the mark

                    HOLLOM
          Bear a hand there you fellows!

The men he is addressing, shoot him a look of distaste which
unsettles Hollom slightly, then they assist him pulling on a
rope

108.       QUARTERDECK - DAY

                    MOWETT
          Up and down Sir, thick and dry for
          weighing.

109.           WAIST OF THE SHIP - DAY

Men strain on the capstan bars.

110.           BOWS - DAY

The anchor bursting up out of the sea.

111.           MASTS OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

The shrouds darken with climbing figures, framed against the
sun.
                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          Trice up. Lay out.
          Sheet home!
          Hoist away!

112.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

HOLLAR staring up as the sails unfurl and fill with wind.

                    HOLLAR
          Cheerly there in the foretop, our
          William!
          T'garnsl sheets!
          Hands to the braces!

Men slide down ropes from high amongst the shrouds, then
swing out and drop down to the deck like monkeys, pulling
ropes and sails tight with the weight of their bodies.

113.        WIDE SHOT - DAY

The ship spreading its wings. A sudden cracking of canvas as
she turns and runs directly downwind.

114.        QUARTERDECK - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun has sunk lower. BONDEN, solid as the rock of
Gibraltar is back at the helm, the wind stronger and directly
behind.

                    JACK
          Speed, Mr. Boyle

BOYLE heaves the log clear of the ship's side. The log line
races out on its reel. BOYLE checks the run, pulls the pin.

                    BOYLE
          Ten and a half knots, Sir.

JACK makes no comment but the news seems to please him.

115.        CLOSE TO THE WATER - DUSK

The great hull powers past us.

116.   DELETED

117.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK prepares toasted cheese in his small serving-area.
From inside the cabin, the sound of a violin and a cello
tuning up. KILLICK glances irritably at the door and elbows
his mate, BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK
          Here we go again: scrape, scrape,
          screech, screech and never a tune you
          could dance to, not if you were drunk as
          Davey's sow.

118.    INSIDE THE GREAT CABIN

JACK and STEPHEN are both keen amateur musicians - JACK,
violin, STEPHEN cello.

As Stephen completes his tuning, Jack experiments with a
refrain.

                    STEPHEN
          Is that one I know, or are we breaking
          new ground?

                    JACK
          I am trying to remember that air they
          played all those years ago at the
          Governors house in Port Mahon. You
          remember When we first met.
          Corelli if I'm not mistaken.

He plays another riff

                     STEPHEN
          If that is your "A" you are very much so.
          This is A.

Jack corrects his A string, plays another few bars

                    JACK
          Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom

                    STEPHEN
          All I remember is you being unable to sit
          in your seat the entire performance.

                    JACK
          Aye and you practising apon that poor
          bishop with your "puddings athwart the
          starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant
          nonsense.

                    STEPHEN
              (laughs)
          No. That was off Toulon, during the
          blockade. At our first meeting they
          played this:

He plays a short refrain

                    JACK
          No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom-
          POM I have now

He plays another variation

                    STEPHEN
              (enjoying the game)
          Or was it something like this....

Cello answers violin, as they hand it back and forth,
improvising freely now with an infinity of variations,
sometimes playing together, sometimes separately, suddenly
hitting it, the music soaring and continuing over

119.        A HIGH POINT OF VIEW, TIME LAPSE - DAY

The tiny ship on the vastness of the ocean. From its side,
cotton-wool puffs of smoke.

120.        GUN-DECK - SAME TIME

A rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns.

                    JACK
          And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging
          we want!

MOWETT timing the gap between each broadside.

                    MOWETT
          Three minutes ten, Sir.

                    JACK
          Not good enough! We must fire three
          broadsides to her two. Again!

Turning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still looks
pale and a little unsure of himself.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a
          gun?
                    BLAKENEY
          As you will. Sir.

                    JACK
          'Spitfire', hop to it.

BLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is in
charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now
directing 'Sudden Death'.

Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing
with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions',
'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out your
gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!'

121.        AND AGAIN - DUSK

As another broadside shakes the deck, STEPHEN hauls his
collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of
sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like
opals in the pink light.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)
          Two minutes five, Sir.

                    PULLINGS
          Again!

122.        AND AGAIN - NIGHT

It's a race. JACK's orders are just a formality, the sequence
having become so automatic now.

                    JACK
          Out Tompions... Run out your guns...
          Prime.

Seconds ticking away on MOWETT's stopwatch, barrels float on
the sea a hundred yards out.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          As she bears, from forward aft. Point
          your guns... Fire!!

123.   THE OCEAN AT NIGHT

The black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around
the target barrels erupting in great spouts.

                    MOWETT (O.S.)
          Two minutes dead.

124.   THE GUNPOWDER ROOM

Boom! Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds
through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down
through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with
more cartridge.

For them too it's a race, little ADDISON just ahead of SWIFT,
RYE hot on his heels.

125.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

The sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard
from STEPHEN's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax.

He is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from
his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the
array of aquatic life-forms. He removes his ear-plugs, but
the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces
them.

126.        ON THE GUN-DECK - NIGHT

MOWETT watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up
as he notes -

The concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving
in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time.

And he stops the watch as the first gun fires.

                    MOWETT
          One minute forty-nine, Sir!

His voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close
succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing
with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his
mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected.

127.        IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The table is dragged back into place and settings laid for
dinner.

JACK enters, his face flushed with victory.

                    JACK
          Killick? Killick there.
KILLICK appears.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What do you have for us tonight?

                    KILLICK
          Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face.

                    JACK
          Aah! My favorite.

128.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards
through the warm night.

Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now
they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone
produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum.

A guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with BLACK
BILL who sings a ballad in an African dialect.

There's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age
and nationality - bonds forged by battle and hardship.

OLD SPONGE gets up and dances a Greek dance: obviously a
favorite among the crew. Cheering and cat-calls. Lanterns
coming up from below. More dancing, insults in many
languages, and a song.

                    GUN-CREWS
          Boneparte Boneparte
          That red-faced son of an old French fart
          Hey ho, stamp and go
          Stamp and go, stamp and go
          Hey ho, stamp and go

129.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

The singing mixes with the end of a lively dinner given by
JACK for his officers, including a special guest, young
BLAKENEY.

                    PULLINGS
          With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has
          composed a short poem in honour of our
          mission.

                    JACK
          Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.

Reactions around the table, glasses re-filled in
anticipation. MOWETT stands and declaims with a number of
precise airy gestures, like a conductor.

                    MOWETT
          Our brotherhood, some old, some new.
          In blood baptized, in strength renewed.
          In purpose unified and true.
          All thoughts of home forsaken.
          Where duty leads us, there we go.
          Nor rest nor comfort shall we know.
          Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded
          sunk or taken

                    ALL
              (raising their glasses)
          Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear
          him! 'Sunk or taken'...

                    JACK
          Aye and when we do take her we shall give
          her to Tom Pullings as his first command.
          If he don't die before then. Bumpers up
          Tom

                    ALLEN
              (A toast)
          'To wives and sweethearts'.

They raise their glasses -

                    ALL
          'To wives and sweethearts'.

                    PULLINGS
          And may they never meet.

Amid the laughter someone bumps Blakeney's stump. He winces,
then puts a brave face on it

                    BLAKENEY (to JACK)
          I believe you knew Nelson, Sir?

                     JACK
          Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of
          serving under him at the Nile.
               (aside)
          Mr. Mowett, the bottle stands by you,
          sir.
               (as the bottle moves on)
          In fact I dined with him twice, and he
          spoke to me on both occasions.

The table goes quiet. BLAKENEY is wide-eyed, though partly
from his strenuous efforts to appear sober.

                    JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D)
          The first time he said to me - 'May I
          trouble you for the salt, sir?' I have
          always tried to say it as close as I
          could [   ] The second time someone had
          offered him a boat-cloak on a cold night
          and he said no, he was quite warm - his
          zeal for his king and country kept him
          warm.

Amid the general agreement - 'Hear him, hear him', etc.
STEPHEN is noticeably silent.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          It sounds absurd, I know, and were it
          another man you would cry out, "Oh, what
          pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere
          enthusiasm, but with him you felt your
          heart glow.

                    MOWETT
              (raising his glass)
          To Lord Nelson.

                    ALL
          Lord Nelson!

[ ] Stephen joins on the toast, but JACK knows that his
friend deplores such overt patriotism and seeks to draw him
back in with a joke.

                    JACK
          You see those two weevils, Doctor?

He points at a faint movement amongst the crumbs of a ship's
biscuit.

                    STEPHEN
          I do.

                    JACK
          Which would you choose?

The table tenses with anticipation of one of the Captain's
'jokes'. STEPHEN concentrates.
                    STEPHEN
          There is not a scrap of difference. They
          are the same species of curculio.

                    JACK
          But suppose you had to choose?

                    STEPHEN
          Then I would choose the right-hand
          weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in
          both length and breadth.

                    JACK
          There I have you. You are completely
          dished. Don't you know in the Navy you
          must always choose 'the lesser of two
          weevils'?

He thunders with laughter, the rest joining in, breathless
with mirth, tears of laughter streaming down their faces

                    ALLEN
          'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick
          a pocket. Dýe not smoke it doctor?

                    STEPHEN
              (poker faced)
          Sure there would be some poor thin barren
          minds that would catch at such a paltry
          clench.

Then he too cracks a smile and joins in their laughter

130.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT

The crew continue with their own celebration.

The excitement penetrates JOE PLAICE's stupor. Never having
woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and
speaks.

                    PLAICE
          "...And the righteous shall inherit the
          earth."

The men around him stare in amazement.

                    BONDEN
          You hear that. He said something. Joe
          spoke! Say something else Joe
                     JOE
           Handy with that gasket

                     BONDEN
               (shouts up to the quarterdeck)
           He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke

131. QUARTERDECK

The officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and
Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment.

132.   IN THE RIGGING - NIGHT

Midshipmen CALAMY RYE and BOYLE are eating from a bag of
broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the
rigging.

On seeing JACK, they break into their own song.

                     MIDSHIPMEN
           Our captain was very good to us.
           He dipped his prick in phosphorus.
           It shed a light all through the night.
           And steered us through the Bosphorus.

133. QUARTERDECK

JACK pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile.
Beside him in a chair sits BLAKENEY, his empty jacket sleeve
pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at
the older boys cheek.

From somewhere on the forecastle, WARLEY and his top-men
start singing.

                     TOP-MEN
           Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish
           ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies
           of Spain...

The older midshipman, HOLLOM joins in, his fine voice soaring
effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering
ballad and converting it to something much more poignant.

                     HOLLOM
           For we've received orders to sail for Old
           England.
           Perhaps we shall never more see you again
His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN
          What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom
          does possess.

134.        IN THE WAIST - NIGHT

KILLICK and NAGEL are less than impressed with HOLLOM and
sing over him, led by ORRAGE the cook.

                    ORRAGE
          Come all you thoughtless young men,
          A warning take by me,
          And never leave your happy homes
          to sail the raging sea.

135.        OCEAN - NIGHT

The Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across
the darkness.

135a.   OCEAN. DAY

The colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics
to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes.

Still the surprise sails on

136.        THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

Fingers trace a course down the east coast of South America.
Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first.

                    ALLEN
          This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled
          with Captain Cook and carried a pair of
          Arnott's chronometers.

JACK finds their position and marks it with pencil. A knock
on the door. Officers and crew are now dressed according to
the change in climate

                    KILLICK
          Couple of the men to see you, Sir.

                    JACK
              (without looking up)
          Show them in.
The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What's this?

A scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every
detail. Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold
on the stern - Acheron.

                    NAGEL
          It were Warley's idea, Sir.

                    WARLEY
          I thought she were familiar like, then I
          remembered where I'd seen her - in
          Boston, during the Peace.

                     JACK
          [   ] In Boston?

                    WARLEY (nods)
          Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them
          working on her, something right strange
          about her scantlings. Then I seen them
          balls bounce off her an' I got to
          thinking.

                    NAGEL
          If you look here, Sir. One side opens up.

He pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction.

                    WARLEY
          Mister Nagel here done it just like I
          seen her - a third layer 'tween the
          outer and inner ribbing - diagonal
          bracing, see?

                    JACK
          Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12
          pounders couldn't penetrate except at
          close range.

He passes the model to ALLEN.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Killick. Killick, there.

KILLICK enters.
                    JACK (CONT'D)
          An extra ration of rum for these men,
          from my private store.

                    KILLICK
              (shaking his head)
          Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.

                    JACK
          Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for
          Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst
          we're alive!

KILLICK goes to get the bottles

JACK hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as
though studying its tiny occupants.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          He's vulnerable here.

He taps the stern windows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Cross her stern, rake her with a
          broadside through her length. But how to
          get close enough? Past those long
          eighteens. That's the devil of it.

136b    SURPRISE QUARTERDECK DAY

The Surprise has stopped level with a Spanish merchantman,
which lies three hundred yards away, headed in the opposite
direction.

The two boats have hove to and are communicating by
megaphone, Stephen translating the Spanish captains words,

                    STEPHEN
          He says they were chased for three days
          till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun
          French privateer headed due south.

                    JACK
          Capital. Thank him and let us be off.

The Spanish captain, already making sail, waves and shouts a
greeting, which Stephen calls back to him.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What did he say there?

                    STEPHEN
          A Spanish farewell. "May no new thing
          arrive." New things being generally by
          their nature bad.

137.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Stephen is with Blakeney, re-bandaging the younger man's
stump. Blakeney looks away, his eyes moving over the doctors
collection of books, learned texts in French Spanish, Greek
and Latin

                    BLAKENEY
          Do you have a manual of exercises sir.

                       STEPHEN
          Exercises?

                    BLAKENEY
          Physical exercises, to make the left arm
          as powerful as the right once was.

                    STEPHEN
          I think that will happen with usage, at
          least to a certain extent.

                    BLAKENEY
          But not completely. I will never be whole
          again, will I?

                    STEPHEN
          No but you will adapt to your new
          situation

          The natural world shows us any number of
          examples of how that is possible.

Blakeney bites his lip

                    BLAKENEY
          You know my father was a great fighting
          captain. It was always his expectation I
          would follow in his footsteps. I worry
          that with this arm I will now be good for
          nothing but book learning and philosophy.

                    STEPHEN
          Ah. Like me you mean.
                     BLAKENEY
               (becoming tearful)
           I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot
           or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress
           myself. What chance to I have now of even
           making first lieutenant.

                      STEPHEN
           You have every chance. You hear me every
           chance. Only the other day I heard the
           captain singing your praises. Your
           courage, your fortitude in battle, your
           skill at logarithms and double elevations
           whatever they may be. And when you are
           rated lieutenant you shall have someone
           to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and
           help you with your jacket. Here take my
           handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed
           to dinner.

139.         MAIN MAST - DAWN

The maintop captain, WARLEY, shouts to the deck, his breath
forming in the frosty air -

                     WARLEY
           Sail on the larboard bow!

140.   GREAT CABIN/LADDER

JACK throwing on a heavy boat-cloak, running for the ladder,
KILLICK behind him trying to get a scarf about JACK's neck
and a cap on his head.

141.         THE RIGGING - DAWN

Follow JACK as he runs up the ratlines, over the futtock
shrouds, then up the topmast shrouds, finally arriving at the
very top of the mast, to join WARLEY and PULLINGS.

                     JACK
           Where away?

                     PULLINGS
           Hull down, two points off the larboard
           beam.

JACK takes the telescope.

142.   TELESCOPE P.O.V.
Just the tips of masts, the hull below the horizon.

                    WARLEY (O.S.)
          She's a frigate all right, but no way of
          knowing if she be the phantom.

Beyond the distant ship, a line of black clouds.

143.        RIGGING - DAWN

JACK and PULLINGS slide to the deck on parallel back-stays,
as careless as a couple of midshipmen.

144.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK shouting -

                    JACK
          Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then
          wet the sails and have the idlers placed
          along the rail.

PULLINGS and HOLLAR bark out their orders. Men race to obey.

JACK steps up on the gunwale, spying out the distant ship.
BLAKENEY, nearby, rests his telescope on CALAMY's shoulder,
focussing with his left hand.

                    BLAKENEY
          Is it him, Sir?

                    JACK
          Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy
          she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin
          to join us, he loves a good chase.

BLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail
which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables.

Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale,
like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the
pull of the sails.


145.        WEATHER-DECK - DAY

Their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the
forecastle. A man falls and rolls into the scuppers.

                    MOWETT
          Lifelines fore and aft!

                    JACK
          Speed, Mr. Calamy?

CALAMY heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts
back to JACK -

                    CALAMY
          Twelve knots, Sir!

146.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Heeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing
as she clefts the waves.

147.        FORECASTLE - DAY

Lined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at
their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye
aloft on the creaking topmost spar.

                    JEMMY DUCKS
          We're cracking on, eh?

                    FASTER DOUDLE
          We'll be cracking off presently if he
          doesn't watch it.

                    SLADE
          No, he knows this ship. He knows what she
          can take.

He touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who
gives a meaningful roll of his eyes.

Ahead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey.

148.        GREAT CABIN - DAY

PULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR. LAMB,
with whom he has been arguing a point.

                    PULLINGS
          We can just see her topsails. She's made
          her turn westwards.

                    LAMB
          I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not
          round Cape Horn.
                     JACK
          I'll not lose her now. Set a course
          westwards.

Both men accept this and leave.

149.        QUARTERDECK (TIMELAPSE) - DAY

The wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like
the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips.

PULLINGS and LAMB are looking up at the mizzenmast which is
making ominous creaks and groans.

                    JACK
          Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps
          and light hawsers to the mastheads.

JACK stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a
switchback landscape of massive rolling waves.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Better get below, Mr. Pullings!

                       PULLINGS
          What, Sir?

                    JACK (GRINNING)
          Better get some food in you. Before it
          turns nasty.

150.        OCEAN - DAY

Wide to see the two ships. The Surprise and the Acheron with
a mile of sea between them. It's like some great ocean race,
with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling
conditions.

151.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a
landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying
motion.

The forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising
each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from
her scuppers.

KILLICK comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. JACK
drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. A wild
unruly part of him is loving this.

Above him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the
mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky.

152.   BELOW DECKS

The dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates
sliding over the table. Crewmen walk up hill to the grog
barrel, down their ration and head up top again.

                     HIGGINS
           You reckon Captain will keep chasing him
           'round the Horn with every stitch of
           canvas flying?

                     DAVIES
           I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of
           hell if he has to.

                     PLAICE
           And that's where we're all going if he
           doesn't take in sail.

Since his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random
pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle.

153.   ON DECK

The wind rising from yell to shriek. Waves blown flat by it,
the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a
raging expanse of white foam.

Four men on the wheel, lashed to it, with the air around them
full of water.

In the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea,
distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a
preposterous height.

JACK looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the
quarterdeck, the officers glancing from the sails back to
JACK.

                     JACK
           Strike the topgallants.

Men gratefully rush to the ratlines and begin climbing to the
masts.

STEPHEN staggers up onto deck. JACK calls to him, pointing at
the black rock.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Cape Horn, Doctor!

STEPHEN stares across at the legendary Cape. He's struggling
with his pocket-glass when a lurch of the ship sends him
tumbling. As men help him below, WARLEY, the maintop captain
reports to the bosun.

                    HOLLAR (to WARLEY)
          Help them with that mizzen topgallant!
          You go too, Mr. Hollom!

HOLLOM looks desperate as he follows WARLEY up the ratlines
of the mizzen.

154.   MIZZEN TOPgallant MAST

WARLEY works frantically. He's out on the yardarm high above
the raging sea. He shouts for HOLLOM to join him, but HOLLOM
is still in the top, some twenty feet below, unable or
unwilling to climb any higher.

155.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide to see the ship. WARLEY working on the swaying mizzen.
The bow swinging a couple of points further south.

156.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

Wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn. Then a
tremendous crack as the mizzen-topmast splits and flies
backward into the sea, carrying WARLEY along with it.

                    BONDEN
          Man overboard!

Sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel. A loose
block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale.

JACK fights free from the tangle of ropes as WARLEY vanishes
in the foam. The mizzenmast is acting as a sea-anchor
dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks.

JACK grabs a speaking-trumpet as WARLEY briefly reappears.

                    JACK
          Swim for the wreckage, man!

Then to PULLINGS.
                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Reduce sail!

As crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging, JACK turns
back to see WARLEY desperately swimming toward the trailing
wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling
wind.

With sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the
dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the
waves.

                    BONDEN
          She's broaching!

PULLINGS runs to JACK, pointing to the trailing mass of ropes
and mast.

                    PULLINGS
          It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut
          it loose, Sir!

WARLEY still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under
with each wave. JACK, agonized, makes his decision.

                    JACK
          Axes!

AWKWARD DAVIES scrambles up the ladder with an axe, but loses
his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck.

JACK grabs the axe and attacks the ropes. He's joined by
NAGEL who has run to assist before realizing that the man
overboard is his friend Warley.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Set to then. Set to!!

NAGEL's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys Jacks orders
and starts chopping. He and Jack work shoulder to shoulder,
matching blow for blow [   ]

The prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right
angles to the ship.

157.        ON THE GUN-DECK - DAY

A hatch cover is torn off by the force of water, a sudden
mighty deluge pouring down into the lower levels drenching
the men and swamping the guns.
                    HOLLAR (yells below)
          All hands to the pumps!

158.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK and NAGEL [   ] keep hacking at the tangle of ropes.
Knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free
the dragging mast.

Finally they succeed. The last of the ropes [ ] whips away,
the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings
southward, away from the rocks.

The wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving WARLEY
struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone.

Then another wave breaks over him and he is gone.

NAGEL is bereft. JACK lowers his head.

159.        OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILL.

                    KILLICK
          He's been at it again.

                    BLACK BILL
          Who's that then?

                       KILLICK
          The Jonah.

                    BLACK BILL
          What Jonah?

160.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits at his desk. The model of the Acheron that WARLEY
helped make sits accusingly in front of him.

STEPHEN pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself.

                     STEPHEN
          The deaths in actual battle are the
          easiest.
              (beat)
          For my own part - those who die under the
          knife or from some consequent infection:
          I have to remind myself that it is the
          enemy who killed them, and not me.
              (beat)
          Warley was a casualty of war, as surely
          as if a French ball had taken him.

JACK nods. Obviously the death still weighs on his
conscience. [ ]

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
              (offering the wine)
          At the same time....

He breaks off

                    Jack
          At the same time, what?

Stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully

                    STEPHEN
          You know that I wear two hats on every
          voyage. I am the captains particular
          friend and supporter, but also I am the
          ships doctor in which later capacity I am
          party to....

He catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)

                    You don't want me to continue.

                    JACK
              (stiffly)
          On the contrary. I insist on it.

                    STEPHEN
          There is talk below decks of turning
          back. Or rather that we should have
          turned back some weeks ago. Of course the
          men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere,
          and usually in the confident expectation
          of victory. But that of course is the
          problem.

                    JACK
          What is the problem?

                    STEPHEN
          That you are not accustomed to defeat
          Jack. That you have taken it too
          personally. That chasing this larger,
          faster ship, with its long guns, is
          beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth
          before destruction'?

                    JACK
          It's not pride nor anything like it, it's
          a question of duty.

                    STEPHEN
          'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end
          of discussion.

                    JACK
          You can be as 'satiric' as you like,
          Stephen, but I have my orders. She is
          attacking our whalers. For why? Without
          whales we have no boot polish, nor any
          soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil
          our sabres and muskets. Destroying our
          whalers could win the war for Napoleon.
          Which is why we must catch this Acheron.
          As a man of learning surely you can see
          that.

                    STEPHEN
          At whatever the cost?

                     JACK
          Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I
          will calculate that myself, Stephen
          without reference to your friends in the
          ward room.

160A MIZZEN-TOP

An icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen
mast.

Hollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions
between the men in the rigging and the men on deck

                      HOLLOM
          Cast off.

The new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously
against the mast. Almost claiming Nagel

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          Belay. Sorry. Sorry.
161    QUARTERDECK

PULLING craning upwards. The topmen's shouted commands are
whipped away by the gale.

JACK joins him, still smarting from the conversation with
Stephen

                    JACK
          We'll have to go further south, get
          around this bloody west wind.

                    PULLINGS
          How far south?

                    JACK
          As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The
          sixtieth parallel if need be.

162.        THE SHIP - DAY

Tacking southwards. The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually
disappearing behind layers of cloud.

The wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a
sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but
never ceases.

                                                DISSOLVE TO -

163.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue.
White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy
pink. Others bright ultramarine.

And still the wind howls, driving them further south.

MOWETT passes his telescope to STEPHEN MATURIN. As STEPHEN
studies some seals on an ice-beach, MOWETT launches into
verse, shouting against the wind -

                     MOWETT
          Then we upon the globes last verge shall
          go to view the ocean leaning on the sky
          from thence our rolling neighbours we
          shall know
          and on the hidden world securely pry!

He is interrupted by a bundle of guns clattering on board
from one of the small boats. They are followed by Mr Howard
clad in several thicknesses of sealskin and carrying a brace
of dead penguin.

164.   THE SHIP AT NIGHT

The ship scudding onwards, soundless at this distance, but
for the chilling high pitched whistle of the wind.

An iceberg passes in foreground, fantastic shapes of ice,
like a Gothic cathedral, sculpted by the elements.

165.         BERTH DECK - NIGHT

Hanging stoves provide some feeble warmth. Men huddle close
to them, their breath condensing, or lie shivering in their
bunks, unable to sleep for the cold.

HOLLAR appears with a lantern.

                     HOLLAR
           Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble
           up, tumble up - sleepers awake!

As the previous watch arrive downstairs, numb and dazed from
the cold, the next watch emerge from their hammocks and
dress. No-one speaks.

166.         THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

The officers take their places at dinner. Once again it's
penguin stew.

PULLINGS comes in, with an unexpected smile on his face and
whispers something to JACK.

                     JACK
           Praise be. At last.

The others seem to know what's going on, all except STEPHEN
who looks baffled.

                     STEPHEN
           Pray what is there to celebrate?

JACK holds up his hand for silence. A series of creaks and
groans from the ship. The coffee pot tilts on its gimbals.

                     JACK
           We have made our turn northward, Doctor.
           We are headed back toward the sun...
The officers give a slightly ragged cheer.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          ...in anticipation of which. I asked
          Killick to prepare something special.
              (shouts off)
          Killick. Killick there.

KILLICK comes in with his usual exasperated expression,
bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it.

                    KILLICK
          Which I was just coming.

He lays it on the table.

                    JACK
          Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.

He whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass, a
pudding cut in the oddest of shapes. Everyone stands to get a
better look.

                    STEPHEN
          The Galapagos Islands.

                    PULLINGS
          'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's
          Narborough, Chatham and Hood...

                     JACK
          That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr
          Allen. So that's where the Acheron will
          be headed.

The mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition, as the
officers marvel over the pudding.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Pullings, if you'll permit me, a
          slice of Albermale. For you Doctor,
          Redondo Rock.

There's a tiny man-of-war made of icing, between the islands.
JACK picks it up in his spoon.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          And, with a fair wind behind us the
          Acheron for me.
167.        OPEN OCEAN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

Slow pan over a glassy expanse of water. JACK's head suddenly
breaks the surface, close to camera.

As he swims he brings the Surprise into view. The ship is
utterly becalmed, wallowing in the swell, her sails hanging
limp. A 'painted ship upon a painted ocean'.

JACK swims around the ship, which currently presents a less
than warlike picture with washing hanging from every part of
the rigging.

He calls up to PULLINGS -

                    JACK
          Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on
          these forechains... black strake needs
          another coat.

168.   QUARTERDECK

JACK comes aboard, takes a towel from KILLICK and looks about
him.

The men are holystoning the deck and polishing the
brightwork. They look thin and exhausted and burnt dark-brown
by the sun and wind.

169.   FORECASTLE

Killick is with NAGEL and others tarring the ratlines as he
looks back at HOLLOM, patrolling the gangway.

KILLICK indicates him with a tilt of the head.

                    KILLICK
          That engagement off Recife: his whole gun
          crew killed and him not a mark on him.
          Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley
          falls. And whose watch was it when we
          lost our wind?

HOLLOM sees them looking at him.

170.        THE SCUTTLEBUTT, SHIP'S WAIST - DAY

A marine sentry, TROLLOPE, stands guard by the ship's water-
barrel - the level is very low. STEPHEN ladles some water
into a phial.
                     TROLLOPE
           One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders.

STEPHEN straightening, irritated by the challenge.

                     STEPHEN
           A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for
           scientific purposes only.

171.         STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAY

In the gloom of his cabin, STEPHEN angles the mirror of his
brass microscope toward the window, and places a slide
containing a droplet of water under the lens.

172.         MAINMAST-TOP - DAY

JACK climbs into the top. He adjusts his telescope, studies
the horizon.

173.   JACK'S TELESCOPE P.O.V.

He pans across the empty sea.

174.   STEPHEN'S MICROSCOPE P.O.V.

An assortment of mobile, transparent micro-organisms rotating
wildly.

                     STEPHEN (O.S.)
           My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo.

PADEEN takes a look, amazed then greatly amused.

175.         THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

Charts are spread all over the table, STEPHEN poring over
them when Jack comes in

                     [   ]

                     STEPHEN
           Show me where these Doldrums lie?

JACK joins him.

                     JACK
           Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of
           you? The doldrums is a condition, not a
           region. But you tend to strike 'em
          here...
              (pointing)
          ...between the trades, and the
          sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is
          having it as bad as we are.

STEPHEN considers their current position on the chart, the
tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to
the west of them.

                    STEPHEN
          Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos,
          and not some other point in all this
          vastness?

                    JACK
          Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted
          to go there. It is said to be a natural
          paradise

                    STEPHEN
          In truth I'd be delighted with the merest
          guano stained rock provided it didn't
          sway beneath my feet

                    JACK
          Well, we'll take on food and water once
          we're there, and as compensation for not
          having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that
          during that time, several days at least,
          you can wander at will, catching bugs and
          beetles to your heart's delight. You will
          be the first naturalist to set foot on
          the islands. That is my solemn promise

                    STEPHEN
          I accept, provided the men have not
          mutinied and thrown us all overboard
          before we get there.

                    JACK
          Mutiny? No. They are already counting
          their share of the prize money.

                    STEPHEN
          Another week of this and they shall
          gladly give it up for a glass of clean
          water.

                    JACK
          Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your
          bellyacheing. We shall have rain
          presently, and if not we shall damned
          well tow ourselves out of this.

176.        JOLLY BOAT - DAY

Disgruntled, under-slept men, in boats towing the ship.

NAGEL and DAVIES look back darkly at HOLLOM who sits in the
stern.

                    HOLLOM
          Stroke. Stroke...

                    DAVIES (whispers)
          I heard he were on the Fair Marion as
          foundered off Tresco. And he were on the
          Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar.

HOLLOM has heard this, as DAVIES intended, but he looks away
choosing to ignore them.

177.        FIGHTING TOP - DAY

A view from above of men towing the ship. Over this an
unpleasant scraping sound - chalk on slate.

                    BONDEN
          M-a-s-t... mast

STEPHEN is writing words on a slate then offering them to
BONDEN whom he is teaching to read.

                    BONDEN (CONT'D)
          S-u-n... sun

STEPHEN nods and scratches another word on the board. As
BONDEN struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket
shot and a seabird falls out of the sky.

HOWARD, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket
laughing aloud.

                    STEPHEN
          Is that man completely mad?
              (shouts down)
          Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!

HOWARD looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon
of a face.

                    HOWARD
          Were you never a man for sporting,
          Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in
          these waters with two men loading!

178.        GUN-DECK - DAY

The midshipmen and powder-monkeys have assembled for weapons
practise, armed with cutlasses. CALAMY and WILLIAMSON divide
the group into two teams, choosing sides as for school-yard
football.

                    CALAMY
          Blakeney...

                      WILLIAMSON
          Rye...

                      CALAMY
          Swift...

                      WILLIAMSON
          Boyle...

                    CALAMY
              (the final choice)
          All right, come on Addison.

Little ADDISON joins CALAMY's side, trailing his too-large
sword. WILLIAMSON tosses a coin.

                      CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Heads.

                    WILLIAMSON
          It's tails. We attack.

CALAMY's side retire to a defensive position made of tar
barrels at one end of the deck. From here they are suddenly
aware of Jack idly watching their mock-fight from the
quarter-deck

WILLIAMSON's team give a yell and charge at them.

It's serious fighting. Heads are struck, fingers are rapped.
BLAKENEY, trying gamely with his left arm but frustrated by
his own ineptitude, goes down under the rush of attackers.

                      BLAKENEY
          Ow ow ow!

                      WILLIAMSON
          Yield.

                    CALAMY
          Let go of him.

                    WILLIAMSON
          Yield!!

CALAMY can't drag the bigger boy off. He whips a pistol out
of his belt and fires it at WILLIAMSON's head.

WILLIAMSON is blasted sideways, clutching his face and
yelling in pain. The other boys separate, horrified.

                    CALAMY
          It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in
          it, just powder.

He helps BLAKENEY to his feet.

                    CALAMY (CONT'D)
          Are you all right?

                    BLAKENEY
          No.

Angrily shaking free of him, he looks to where Jack stood,
but the captain is no longer watching.

                    CALAMY
          What's wrong? I saved you.

                    BLAKENEY
          I didn't need to be saved.

179.        ON DECK - DAY

Tar bubbling under the heat of the sun. Cannons fizzing and
steaming as they are washed.

There's been a change of crews in the long-boats, and HOLLOM
and his men are now back on board. NAGEL is approaching from
one end of the narrow gang-way, HOLLOM from the other. NAGEL
pushes past, deliberately bumping HOLLOM, who stumbles,
clutching for the gunwale.

180.        QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK sees this outrageous act of indiscipline and yells out -

                    JACK
          Master at arms! Take that man below and
          clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings,
          defaulters at six bells.

181.        THE GREAT CABIN, DOLDRUMS - DAY

JACK stands behind his desk, brow like thunder. From outside
the sounds of the muster. HOLLOM stands in front of him,
twisting his hat between his hands.

                    JACK
          The man pushed past you without making
          his obedience. And yet you said nothing.

                    HOLLOM
          No, Sir, I intended to but the right
          words just didn't...

                    JACK
          'The right words'? He failed to salute
          you. It's deliberate insubordination.

HOLLOM looks at the floor, mumbles -

                    HOLLOM
          They don't like me, Sir.

                    JACK
          They what? Speak up, man!

HOLLOM raises his head and looks at JACK, his eyes shiny with
tears and when he opens his mouth the words tumble out in a
rush.

                    HOLLOM
          I've tried to get to know the men a bit,
          Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken
          a set against me. Always whispering when
          I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set
          that to rights, be tougher on them from
          now on.

                    JACK
          You can't make 'friends' with the
          foremast jacks, they'll despise you in
          the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant.
          It's leadership they want, strength,
          respect.

                    HOLLOM
          I'm very sorry, Sir.
                    JACK
          You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?

                    HOLLOM
              (smiling weakly)
          Twenty-five next Friday.

                    JACK
          You've failed to pass for lieutenant
          twice. You can't spend the rest of your
          life as a midshipman.

                    HOLLOM
          I'll try harder, Sir.

KILLICK helps JACK on with his full-dress uniform.

                    JACK
          Well, it's an unfortunate business,
          Hollom. Damned unfortunate.

KILLICK seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat
emphatically on JACK's head.

Jack turns and strides out of the cabin, HOLLOM following
slowly after him.

182.        QUARTERDECK, DOLDRUMS - DAY

The entire crew has been mustered. The uniformed officers
line the quarterdeck as JACK reads from the Articles of War.

                    JACK
          'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not
          capital, committed by any person or
          persons in the fleet... shall be punished
          according to the laws, and customs, of
          the sea.'
              (then, to NAGEL)
          Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man
          and yet you failed to salute an officer.
          You knew what you were doing. Have you
          anything to say in your defence?

NAGEL looks at the deck.

                     NAGEL
          No, Sir.

                     JACK
          Have his officers anything to say for
          him?

DAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks
wretched but says nothing.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Seize him up.

NAGEL is spread-eagled to the grating, his hands tied.

                    HOLLAR
          Seized up, Sir.

                    JACK
          One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.

The mate takes the leather cat-o-nine tails out of its red
bag.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

183.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK stands alone, tuning his fiddle. No matter how much he
turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. He tunes
some more and breaks it.

                    JACK
          Red hell...

184.        QUARTERDECK - DUSK

                    JACK (O.S.)
          ...and bloody death!

Every word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who
pretend to hear nothing.

185.        THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK

JACK is fitting a new string. Widen to reveal STEPHEN sitting
opposite with his cello.

                    STEPHEN
          I was merely remarking that you have
          always prided yourself on not being a
          flogging captain and this...
                    JACK
          I am not a "flogging captain". I have not
          once rigged the grating on this voyage,
          not once in twelve thousand miles.
          Besides, I wager you will find a deal
          more brutality on land.

Tightening the new string. The note escalating as he turns.

                    STEPHEN
          I'm not a party to it on land.

                    JACK
          Well you are party to it on my ship.
          Men must be governed. Often not wisely I
          grant you, but there are hierarchies even
          in nature, as you've often said yourself.

                    STEPHEN
          Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every
          tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.

                    JACK
              (trying to call a halt)
          Yes. Fine words I'm sure

                    STEPHEN
              (continues regardless)
          ...We are not animals and I for one am
          opposed to authority, that egg of misery
          and oppression..

                    JACK
          Very fine words Stephen, but In these
          current circumstances, hard-work and firm
          discipline is what keeps our little
          wooden world together.

                    STEPHEN
          And grog I suppose.

                            JACK
          Of course. What of it? Of course they
          have their grog!

                    STEPHEN (sits) (CONT'D)
          You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted
          Hollom. And Higgins is never sober. Even
          the midshipmen...

                    JACK
          The men will have their grog Stephen. It
          is part of the immemorial tradition of
          the service

                    STEPHEN
          Well a shameful tradition it is too. To
          have them pressed from their homes, kept
          in a permanent state of dull inebriation.

                       JACK
          Stephen...

                    STEPHEN
          ...confined for months in a wooden
          prison, Never more than a few hours sleep
          and flogged when drunken idleness drives
          them to....

                     JACK (forcefully)
          ...Stephen! I warn you that friend or no
          I will not have you talk of the service
          like that.

                    STEPHEN
          I am stating plain facts

                    JACK
              (finally explodes)
          Well I will not hear them! From you or
          anyone. You understand! Things are as
          they are for good or bad whether or not
          they have a place in your damned papist
          philosophy. If you are here to make music
          then sit down and play. If not be gone,
          for you have come
          to the wrong shop for anarchy!

In stony silence Stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves
past Killick, who is lurking as always by the door.

186.        SCUTTLEBUTT - DUSK

Something disturbs the dark surface of the water as HOLLOM
dips the ladle and fills his cup.

A sense of someone moving up behind him. HOLLOM turns
abruptly. It's the marine sentry, moving in the shadows. He
stares at HOLLOM as he backs away toward the ladder and
hurries below.

187.        BERTH DECK - DUSK
To reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the
berth deck, past HOWARD obsessively cleaning his pistol,
another man whittling with a knife, DAVIES adding another
link in the tattooed chain about BECKETT's middle.

No-one speaks as HOLLOM runs the gauntlet of their stares,
acutely aware of his own breathing. It now seems universally
to be held that he is the author of all the ship's
misfortune.

Nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging
gleaming wetly in the lamplight

Hollom's breath quickens. He stumbles on someone's dunnage,
almost trips but is caught before he falls. It's one of
NAGEL's mates.

                    NAGEL's MATE
          Careful, sir.

188.        MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - DUSK

HOLLOM comes in, wild-eyed and goes to his berth, breathing
hard. CALAMY, BLAKENEY & BOYLE look up from a tense game of
cards.

                    BLAKENEY
          Are you all right, Hollom?

HOLLOM shakes his head miserably, hyperventilating.

                    CALAMY
          He's not sick. He's useless. He's just
          dodging work.

                    BLAKENEY (angrily)
          Oh shut up Calamay. What do you know
          about anything?

CALAMY glares at BLAKENEY.

189.   INT STEPHEN'S ROOM - DUSK

A shot from the deck above.

STEPHEN looks up from his book "Di Consolazione Philosophae".
Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock
at the door.

Its Joe Plaice, looking agitated.
                    PLAICE
          Beg your pardon, your honour, but Mr.
          Howard just shot a sea-monster!

190.        GANGWAY - DUSK

STEPHEN and PLAICE stride along to where the marine captain,
HOWARD, peers down into the water with one of his men.

                    HOWARD
          Doctor! The very man.

STEPHEN moves to the rail, looks out.

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          [   ] I wished you'd seen it for
          yourself, Doctor. The crew never seen
          anything like it.

On the glassy sea, a smudge of blood and some ripples

                    HOWARD (CONT'D)
          It was prodigious like a human, though
          bigger, might have been a sea-elephant,
          it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to
          hit the calf, I missed my mark.

                    STEPHEN
          Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men
          can't eat it or I can't dissect it,
          please do not shoot every creature you
          see.

STEPHEN stares back down at the ripples spreading over the
glassy sea.

191.        THE SURPRISE - NIGHT

Wide, on the troubled ship, small yellow patches of light
visible from the gun-ports.

192.        BELOW DECKS - NIGHT

The men are lying in their hammocks when, from somewhere
outside, there comes an ungodly howling. It stops, then comes
again, exactly human in its pitch.

The crew look at one another. This is like no sound they've
ever heard.
The howling stops then comes again, from another direction.

193.          THE GREAT CABIN, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

KILLICK and BLACK BILLY listening.

                    KILLICK
          What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.

194.          QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

JACK comes up from below.

                    JACK
          What is that abominable noise, for God's
          sake?

                    PULLINGS
          I have no idea, Sir.

                    MOWETT
          You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?

                    JACK
              (untypically cutting)
          The enemy cannot come on us without a
          wind, Mr. Mowett.

He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew. The
wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as STEPHEN joins the
group.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What do you make of it, Doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          I'm sure I've never heard the like.

The crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as
another anguished howl fills the night.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Perhaps it's the mother of the creature
          Mr. Howard shot.

                     JACK
          [    ] Creature?

                    STEPHEN
          [ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly.
          Though I have never known one with a cry
          like this.

A glance along at HOWARD on the gangway, as terrified as
anyone.

                    JACK
          Bosun. Fire off some flares.

195.        WIDE ON THE SHIP - NIGHT

Three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a
pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to
echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond.

196.        QUARTERDECK - NIGHT

The light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty
of sand. Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen
to the spot. Jack rounds on him.

                    JACK
          Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking
          of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.

Roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes
its flow.

Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power
of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. And when the
sound comes once more they all freeze.

JACK joins MOWETT at the taffrail. The thing is somewhere out
there, whatever it is.

                    MOWETT
          Perhaps some poor shipwreck?

He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)
          Ahoy! Is anyone there?

Part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply.
The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now
in the sky.

JACK turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his
own. It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white,
staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror
lies out there.
                    JACK
          Padeen. What are you doing on the
          quarterdeck?

He looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the
bottom of the ladder, some with weapons.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Below! All of you men below!
              (to MOWETT)
          Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep
          with their lamps on.

197.        LOWER DECK - NIGHT

Several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a
battle-lantern. Joe Plaice grim. Doudle wide-eyed. Higgins
with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever.

                    BLACK BILL
          Duppies make that noise.

                    KILLICK (indicating BILL)
          See. They know all about this in Africa.

                    DOUDLE
          What's a duppie?

                    BLACK BILL
          That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit
          can't get out. Him duppie now.

                    SLADE
          Captain don't even know what that noise
          be.

General nods of agreement.

                    DOUDLE
          Doctor neither, and he knows everything.

                    KILLICK
          Joe here's got the most experience in
          these matters, and new brains to boot,
          let's hear it from Joe.

All eyes on JOE PLAICE. He speaks from the shadows.

                    PLAICE
          It's the Jonah causing it. That howling
          thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship.
          He's calling it up, don't you see? Every
          time he's on watch the ship appears. You
          wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear
          any time tonight, and take us all
          straight to the hot-place.

Another shriek, closer now, seems to confirm JOE's bizarre
theory.

198.        MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH - NIGHT

The boys sit together. None of them look at HOLLOM, who sits
pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his
stomach.

199.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

As the howling continues, STEPHEN looks through a number of
books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what
they're experiencing.

As JACK looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a
picture in one of STEPHEN's books.

He picks it up.

Close on the picture - it's an engraving of a giant squid,
its tentacles wrapped around a ship.

Back on JACK holding the picture up to STEPHEN.

                    JACK
          You don't think...?

There is a knock on the cabin door and BLAKENEY enters,
agitated.

                    BLAKENEY (to STEPHEN)
          It's Mr. Hollom, sir, you better come
          quick.

200.   MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH

HOLLOM writhing in agony on the floor, STEPHEN trying to calm
him, shouting for assistance from the midshipmen and then
from PADEEN.

                    STEPHEN
          Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself.
          Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen
201.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT.

Stephen is writing some case notes in his journal, when Jack
puts his head around the door.

Stephens POV: The lamp, lighting his face from below and to
one side, gives a strange lopsided twist to Jacks smile

                    JACK
          Well?

                    STEPHEN
          There's nothing physically wrong with
          him. He thinks he's been cursed by the
          0men.

                    JACK
          Then he probably has been. Sailors will
          abide a great deal, but never a Jonah.
          It's like a white crow - the others peck
          it to death.

                    STEPHEN
          A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.

                    JACK
          I desired to save you the trouble of
          looking for a cure. No doubt it will all
          be sorted by the morning.


202      FORECASTLE, LATER - NIGHT

BLAKENEY stands near the bows peering out into the night. A
figure approaches from behind and lays a hand in his
shoulder.

BLAKENEY nearly jumps out of his skin.

                    BLAKENEY
          Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are
          you better now?

HOLLOM's breathing does indeed seem easier.

                    HOLLOM
          Much better, thank you.

                    BLAKENEY
          I think the creature is going away.
                    HOLLOM
          I am sure of it.

He reaches down, picks up a 12 pound cannonball.

                    HOLLOM (CONT'D)
          You've always been very kind to me.
          Goodbye, Blakeney.

With a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps
over the side the cannonball in his arms.

BLAKENEY looks down with shock to see HOLLOM's pale face
receding from him into the depths. It's a moment before he
gathers his wits to shout -

                    BLAKENEY
          Man overboard!

203.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

The ship's company are mustered on deck. JACK stands at the
sword rack lectern. KILLICK hands him a Bible open at the
story of Jonah.

JACK looks, then hands it back to KILLICK.

                    JACK
          The fact is, [   ] not all of us become
          the men we once hoped we might be. But we
          are all God's creatures. If some of us
          thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill
          of him, or failed him in respect of
          fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness,
          Lord, and we ask for his.

Close on the faces of the crew - KILLICK, HIGGINS, NAGEL,
CALAMY, BLAKENEY and finally Stephen who is staring oddly at
Jack, as though holding him partly responsible for this
latest tragedy.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Amen.

                    CREW (mumble ashamedly)
          Amen.

The men on deck remain standing, heads bowed, observing a
minute's silence, as the sky begins to pale, and the white
disc of the sun appears above them.
FASTER DOUDLE is the first to look up, followed by others -
the terrible sound has gone and a small puff of wind is
stirring the mainsail.

204. HOUR GLASS

The sand runs out of the half-hour glass.

                    BONDEN
          Strike eight bells.

                    QUARTERMASTER (to the marine sentry)
          Turn the glass and strike the bell.

The glass is inverted. The bell tolls.

205.        SURPRISE AT SEA - DAY

The ship moves through a tropical squall. Men rig a sail to
catch the water, others appear with barrels and tubs,
anything to catch the precious rain.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

206.        THE SURPRISE - DAY

Sea birds swarming over a shoal of fish in the foreground as
the cry of the distant lookout carries faintly across the
sea.

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
          Land-ho!

207.        GANGWAY - DAY

BLAKENEY runs along the gangway, past STEPHEN, en route to
the quarterdeck.

                     BLAKENEY
          Give you joy, sir! We have raised the
          Galapagos!

208.     MONTAGE oF TELESCOPE VIEWS, GALAPAGOS - DAY

There's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a
world just born. The wild creatures that inhabit the lava
flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises,
iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of
exotic animals and plants.
209.        QUARTERDECK/FORECASTLE/TOPS - DAY

The ship fairly bristles with telescopes.

210.   FORECASTLE

A small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope.

                    HIGGINS (looking)
          Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks
          and lizards.

DOUDLE takes the telescope.

                    DOUDLE
          Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't
          natural.

211.   QUARTERDECK

STEPHEN and BLAKENEY side by side. From both their faces we
sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for
the first time.

                    STEPHEN
          How extraordinary.

                       BLAKENEY
          What, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          Those birds!

He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds
waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          A species of cormorant. But apparently
          flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe
          that is unknown to science.

BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds
then drifts back to the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.

                    STEPHEN
          They are a type of iguana I should think,
          and therefore vegetarian.
His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is
wholly absorbed in the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          Will you catch one?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some
          eggs.

                    BLAKENEY
          I mean the great lizards.

                    STEPHEN
          Oh!

Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to
BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          I should think a pair of them. Then you
          can present one of their offspring to the
          king.

                    BONDEN
          Ha! There's one going for a swim.

                    STEPHEN
          No. Iguanas are land animals.

                    BONDEN
          Not these ones.

The prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened,
begin diving into the water.

                    STEPHEN (O.S.)
          By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new
          species in as many minutes.

He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between
the lookout and the quarterdeck.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          What is all that confounded bellowing?

                    JACK
          All hands about ship!

BLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way by
hands rushing to get at the sails.

                    NEHEMIAH SLADE
          By your leave sir, by your leave.

                    HOLLAR (distant)
          Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets -
          mainsail haul!

As the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men
aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands.

212.        IN THE LEE OF THE SHIP'S HULL (TIME-LAPSE) - DAY

The whaleboat has come alongside.

Men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped
aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting.

                    HOGG
          God bless you. Thank you, shipmates.

213.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY

HOGG, the senior whaler, sits with his mates, relating his
story to JACK and the officers.

                    HOGG
          We was coming back for fresh lines, hid
          in that inlet, yonder. Black-three
          master. Bit beamy and raised in the
          stern.

Meaningful looks among Jack and his men. Its definitely the
Acheron he's describing [   ]

Hogg meanwhile takes a pint mug of water, gulps it down, and
passes it back to BLAKENEY for a refill.

                    HOGG (CONT'D)
          Hundred thousand pound of good whale oil
          they stole. Then the bastards...

                    ALLEN
              (cuffs him)
          No swearing on the quarterdeck.

                    JACK
              (waves ALLEN away)
          Go on.
                     HOGG
           ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and
           headed off, bunch of fugging pirates.

Looking pointedly at Allen

                     [      ]

                     JACK
           And her course?

                     HOGG
           Maybe a point south of west. Following
           the rest of the whaling fleet.

                     JACK (rising)
           Mr. Mowett, these men to be entered on
           the ship's books. Mr. Allen, lay a course
           west sou'west.

As ALLEN hurries away shouting orders -

                     PULLINGS
           Should we not take on fresh supplies,
           Sir? Those tortoises...

                     JACK (overlapping, impatient)
           There's not a moment to lose, Mr.
           Pullings.

He leaves the quarterdeck and goes below, STEPHEN following.

214.   IN THE GREAT CABIN

JACK has taken his jacket off and is already unfurling his
charts. STEPHEN hurries in.

                     STEPHEN
           Have you forgotten your promise?

                     JACK
               (not looking up)
           Subject to the requirements of the
           service, Stephen. I could not in all
           conscience delay for the sake of an
           iguano or a... giant peccary -
           interesting no doubt, but of no immediate
           application.

                     STEPHEN (overlap)
          How can you dismiss, out of hand, the
          bounty of nature? Knowledge that... that
          will help to progress...

                    JACK (overlap)
          I can see nothing on shore that will
          progress our mission.

                    STEPHEN (overlap)
          But how can we possibly know what lies
          [ ] on these islands, perhaps some
          knowledge that may save life, that...

                    JACK (overlap)
          I will tell you how to save lives
          Stephen. Inform me how to guide this
          ship, undetected, under the nose of a 40
          gun frigate. That is the job in hand sir.

STEPHEN swallows his indignation and tries for a compromise.

                    STEPHEN
          Well perhaps there's an opportunity to
          serve both our objectives. As I
          understand it you mean to go round the
          end of this long island, then start your
          voyage. I could walk across it, be on the
          other side long before...

JACK shakes his head.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          I would walk briskly, pausing only for
          important measurements and almost
          certainly making valuable discoveries...

                    JACK (interrupts)
          If wind and tide had been against us I
          should have said yes. They are not and I
          am obliged to say no.
              (with finality)
          No.

STEPHEN is livid. Betrayed.

                    STEPHEN
          I see. So after all this time in your
          service I must simply be content to form
          part of this belligerent expedition,
          hurry past inestimable wonders, bent
          solely on destruction...
                    JACK
          ...you forget yourself, sir.

                    STEPHEN
          No Jack, You have forgotten your self.
          You once believed in the rights of each
          individual man no matter how useless or
          lowly. But it seems to me now that the
          long exercise of power has brought you to
          the point where even a solemn promise...

                    JACK
          The promise was conditional.

                    STEPHEN
          ...a promise to a friend of ten years
          standing who has stood by you and
          supported you....

                    JACK (overlapping)
          I command a King's ship, not a private
          yacht...

                    STEPHEN
          ...across half the worlds oceans often at
          risk to his own life

                    JACK
          ...and we have no time for your damned
          hobbies, sir!

"Hobbies". So that is JACK's honest view of STEPHEN's
lifetime of work in science. He bows slightly, then leaves.

215         QUARTERDECK - DUSK

STEPHEN stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands
recede in the distance.

News of the violent argument has spread and there is many a
sympathetic glance, which further humiliates STEPHEN.

BLAKENEY approaches him carrying something carefully in the
palm of his hand.

                    BLAKENEY
          Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on
          the deck.

He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown
beetle.

                      BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
            I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir.

                      STEPHEN
            I'm sure of it.

                      BLAKENEY
            Were you to have walked all day on the
            island, you might never have come across
            it.

                      STEPHEN
            That is more than likely, sure.

BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN.

                      BLAKENEY
            You can have it.

                      STEPHEN
            Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation,
then retreats.

216       IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

JACK sits alone at the table. KILLICK enters with toasted
cheese for two.

                      KILLICK
            No music? That's a shame

He sets down the toasted cheese.

                      KILLICK (CONT'D)
            I'll just leave the one plate then, if
            himself won't be joining.

                      JACK
            Yes, Killick. Just the one.

JACK cuts himself a portion, scowling at STEPHEN's cello
which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats.

217.      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN takes a dropper, carefully measures twenty drops of
laudanum to a glass of water, and drinks.
218.        LOOKOUT - DAY

The lookout leaning out from the cross-trees.

                    DOUDLE (shouting)
          On deck there. Object fine on the
          starboard bow.

219.        THE SHIP LYING STATIONARY - DAY

A barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up
the side of the ship.

220.   IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP

JACK comes down, accompanied by ALLEN, the acknowledged
expert in these matters.

Others gather round, including HOGG the whaler, inspecting
the stencilled markings.

                    ALLEN
          Martha's vineyard.

                    HOGG
          No, this here's from Boston. I was
          married there once.

                    ALLEN
          Any road, it's a Yankee barrel.

                    HOGG
          What they call a Bedford Hog in New
          England.

                    MOWETT (to JACK)
          The Acheron touched at Boston.

                    HOGG
          And it's not been in the water more than
          a week.

                    ALLEN
          One can't say with any accuracy but...

                    HOGG
          Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on
          it, and the dowels is sound.

221.        ON THE QUARTERDECK - DAY
JACK returns to his post.

                    JACK
          Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.

TOM PULLINGS watches him. There has been a change amongst the
officers and crew toward JACK. His relentless driving after
the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession
not shared by his exhausted men.

He is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the
gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea,
sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the
earth.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO -

222.        LADDER (TIME LAPSE) - DAY

A wild wind humming through the rigging as STEPHEN goes
topside.

223.        FORECASTLE - DAY

He finds various hands making the boats secure.

                    PLAICE
          Have you seen the bird, doctor?

                    STEPHEN
          I have not - no bird these many days.
          What kind of a bird?

                    PLAICE
          A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps
          a prodigious great mew. He has been
          following the ship since... there he is,
          crossing our wake!

224.        ON THE GANGWAY - DAY

STEPHEN runs along the gangway to get a clearer view,
checking himself when he sees JACK on the quarterdeck.

Their eyes meet. The quarterdeck is JACK's domain now, and
STEPHEN avoids it.

Then, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears.

It's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and
flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the
gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails.

STEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning
forward to get a better view.

At the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway,
HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The
bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.

Again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently
uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the
water.

STEPHEN sags to the deck. A shout. People running. Blood
spreading across the white of his shirt. HOWARD there by his
side.

                    HOWARD
          My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird
          dropped low. I didn't see you there!

JACK is there, shouting -

                    JACK
          Calamy! Get Higgins!
              (then turning to BONDEN)
          Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.

STEPHEN gets slowly up, hands reaching to help him, HOWARD in
the background distraught, explaining to anyone who'll listen
what happened.

                    STEPHEN
          It's all right, I am quite capable of
          walking.

He tries to stand, crumples.

225.        STEPHEN's CABIN - DAY

HIGGINS presses clumsily around the wound as STEPHEN lies on
the bed, his abdomen rigid, his breathing laboured. JACK
watches from the door.

                    STEPHEN
          You will just make it worse... by
          prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got
          at... except by opening me up.

A violent pitching of the ship makes it obvious how
impossible this will be under sail.

As STEPHEN lapses into unconsciousness, HIGGINS looking
alarmed, approaches JACK.

                     HIGGINS (a whisper)
           The bullet took a piece of shirt in with
           it. Unless it is removed it will
           suppurate and fester.

                     JACK
           Are you equal to the task?

                     HIGGINS
           I'll need to read up on the Doctor's
           books, like. Study some pictures he has,
           get my bearings. Be better on land, but
           I'll manage somehow.

JACK looks away from the alcoholic HIGGINS back to STEPHEN.

226.   OUTSIDE THE CABIN

JACK passes an anxious crowd of the ship's company: BLAKENEY,
JOE PLAICE, KILLICK and HOWARD.

                     JACK
           You men get about your business.

There are dark looks in JACK's direction as he retreats to
his cabin.

227.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK throws a chart on the table.

With his protractor he marches out great strides west into
the Pacific from the Galapagos Islands and marks the ship's
position - they are maybe a hundred miles from the Galapagos,
ahead, open sea until the Marquesas.

228.       INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN - DUSK

Lying on his bed, in some pain, STEPHEN hears thudding feet,
shouted orders.

In his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. His
pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus.

There's a knock on the door and JEMMY DUCKS appears with a
mug of soup and some biscuit.
                    JEMMY DUCKS
          ...sail on the horizon, sir. Hull down,
          running west. It may be a couple of days
          before we can catch her.

STEPHEN nods, all he wants is quiet.

JEMMY DUCKS retreats, as STEPHEN swigs from a little bottle
of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively
blocking out the noise from above.

A smile to PADEEN, like a farewell, and he closes his eyes.

229.        FORECASTLE - DUSK

JACK, telescope to his eye, studies the distant ship as
PULLINGS jumps down from the ratlines to the deck.

                     PULLINGS
          It might be the Acheron. If we put on
          more sail we'd come up with her before
          nightfall.

JACK lowers the telescope, turns his back on PULLINGS,
strangely abstracted.

                     PULLINGS (CONT'D)
               (to his back)
          Do you wish me to set the topgallants?
               (no reply)
          Sir?

A long silence. Then JACK walks away.

PULLINGS stares perplexed from JACK's retreating figure to
the distant chase.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO -

230.        INTERIOR STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAWN

Early morning light on the interior of the cabin. PADEEN is
asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair.

STEPHEN himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his
mouth open, no colour in his face.

The sea is relatively calm. From outside the sound of the
bosun's orders, over rattling blocks and pulleys.
                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          ...Clap on now! Every rope an end...
          Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You
          grass-combing lubber!

MOWETT comes in, sees STEPHEN, and takes him for dead.

                    MOWETT
              (shouts outside)
          Davies! Slade!

Two big men come in behind him. PADEEN wakes, confused and
pushes them away, moving protectively to the doctor's side.

The commotion disturbs STEPHEN. His eyes open. Like a dead
man just come back to life.

                    MOWETT (CONT'D)
          Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move
          you onto a stretcher?

STEPHEN swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of
things.

231.        A GALAPAGOS ISLAND - DAY

A giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the
stony beach.

At its head, STEPHEN is carried in a litter up to where a
tent has been set up above the high-water mark.

His P.O.V. as JACK appears in the blue sky above him.

                    STEPHEN
          Tell me this wasn't on my account?

                     JACK
              (dead pan)
          No. It was because of Higgins.
              (beat)
          Can't have him poking around in your
          belly without a solid platform to work
          on.

He ducks as they enter -

232.        THE HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

In the creamy light, they lay STEPHEN down on a recently-
constructed wooden operating table.

HIGGINS squats on the ground, rummaging through various large
sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece
of Hessian.

                    JACK
          All set, Higgins?

STEPHEN grabs JACK's sleeve.

                    STEPHEN
          Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.

Jack frowns, unsure what he means by this.

EXT. THE TENT - NIGHT

PADEEN stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping
at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious.

INT. THE TENT - NIGHT

STEPHEN sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of
chests, his back against a coil of rope. In front of him,
suspended by pulleys, LAMB and NAGEL have set up a large
gilt-framed mirror.

Beside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and
scalpels.

                    STEPHEN
              (To Jack)
          [ ] You are sure you have a head and a
          stomach for this kind of thing?

                    JACK (smiles)
          My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and
          wounds since I was a little boy.

                    STEPHEN
          Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when
          I give the word.


STEPHEN begins first with the knife, then the probe - the
grind of metal on living bone.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          You will have to raise the rib, Higgins.
          Take a good grip with the square
          retractor. Up. Harder, harder.
              (to himself)
          Snip the cartilage.

The metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure.
          Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier.
          Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press.

JACK closes his eyes. STEPHEN draws in his breath, arches his
back, and it's done.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          There she is.

He pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his
shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Is that all of it?

The bloody piece of shirt is handed to HIGGINS who matches it
to the hole in STEPHEN's old shirt.

                    HIGGINS
          Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir.

                    STEPHEN
          Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the
          retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain,
          while I swab.

HIGGINS helps JACK into a chair, pressing his head down
between his knees. After a moment, and a few deep breaths,
JACK looks up. STEPHEN smiles at him. A hint of surly
triumph.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK

                                                   FADE UP ON -

235.        STEPHEN'S TENT - DAY

Through a gap in the door of his tent STEPHEN can see the
distant ship at anchor. Repairs are underway, guns being
unloaded, stores and fresh water being ferried aboard.

BLAKENEY comes in, followed by PADEEN with a some numbered
boxes hung round his neck.
                    STEPHEN
          My goodness, what is this?

BLAKENEY starts rolling up the sides of the tent as PADEEN
unloads his boxes, each with a beetle and a piece of
vegetation in it.

                    BLAKENEY
          Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing
          some collecting for you. The beetles each
          come with a specimen of plant they were
          found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There
          he goes.

He finishes rolling up the tent sides to reveal a collection
of cages, with native wildfowl in them, being fed by the
poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS.

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          The birds were snared by Jemmy Ducks.
          Captain says we can keep them in the
          chicken coop.

Then, producing a notebook -

                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          And I made a few notes if you want to see
          them.

STEPHEN flips the pages:

No 22. Large square black beetle with pincers. Found under
rock. Eats earthworms.

                    STEPHEN
          'Pon my word you have the makings of a
          true naturalist.

BLAKENEY is flattered but unsure.

                    BLAKENEY
          Well sir, perhaps I could combine them,
          and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist,
          like yourself?

                                    [   ]

Stephen smiles at this description as he levers himself into
a sitting position.
                    STEPHEN
          Shall we take a tour of your aviary?

BLAKENEY looks doubtfully at the doctor's bandaged abdomen.

                    BLAKENEY
          Should you really be up?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Padeen!

PADEEN puts the escaped beetle in his mouth for safe keeping
and offers STEPHEN a hand. STEPHEN pulls himself painfully to
his feet and starts buttoning his shirt.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
              (To Blakeney)
          How long does the Captain intend that we
          stay here, do you know?

ON THE BEACH - DAY

JACK is watching those of the crew not on duty play cricket
on the shore, with a canvas ball and stumps made of
driftwood.

                    JACK
          Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great
          hurry.

                     STEPHEN
          But surely, we must make haste for the
          Marquesas?

                    JACK
          It may not have been the Acheron that we
          sighted. Nor can we be sure of her
          destination.
              (looks away)
          No, I think we shall go home now, before
          peace breaks out with France, God forbid.

He's making light of what has been a huge and far-reaching
decision.

                    STEPHEN
          But how will it sit with the Admiralty?
          To have spent six months in a fruitless
          pursuit and then come home empty-handed?
                    JACK
          "Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What
          about these plants and animals which
          Blakeney has been collecting? The British
          museum will need an entire new wing for
          'em.

STEPHEN regards him gravely, shaking his head.

                    STEPHEN
          I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a
          debt I can never repay.

He is absolutely sincere about this, to JACK's great
embarrassment.

                    JACK
          Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something
          prickly and hard to eradicate.

                    STEPHEN
          A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise:
          Testudo Aubreii!

237.        SURPRISE CAMP - DAWN

STEPHEN, BLAKENEY and PADEEN leave the camp on STEPHEN's
first day of exploration. They are armed with nets, baskets
and a day's supply of food and water.

STEPHEN walks slightly stooped, leaning on a walking stick.

238.        COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A strange and wonderful landscape lies before them, with its
organically-shaped lava flows and alien-looking flora and
fauna.

Everywhere STEPHEN looks there are creatures unique to the
islands. He is in his element, collecting specimens which
PADEEN carefully stores in the baskets.

BLAKENEY has his telescope trained on some distant humps.

                    BLAKENEY
          Doctor, would you think it very
          unscientific of me to ride on the back of
          one of those tortoises.

                    STEPHEN
          No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an
          experiment of absolutely vital
          importance. But afterwards, I do desire
          to find that flightless cormorant,
          assuming that is what it is, and that I
          still have strength enough to catch it.

239.        A VALLEY - DAY

BLAKENEY gets astride a giant tortoise and burns his bottom
on its scorching hot shell.

240.        LAVA BEDS - DAY

STEPHEN with his telescope taking notes on bird-life.

241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY

The huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a
butterfly in evening light.

242.        A HEADLAND - DAY

Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of
distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain.

The group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the
headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming
up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition.

243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY

STEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the
hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near
the crest - the cormorant.

On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun
to bleed again.

Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry.

244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE

Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances
above him.

Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on.

STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the
crest just above him.
245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND

A clearing. There is movement in the bushes.

STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and
enters a clearing.

He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing.

He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and
PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again.

STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He
picks it up.

Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY
gave him aboard the Surprise.

Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature
to eye level.

His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind
it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape.

The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a
bay.

The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's
the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor.

246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

BLAKENEY urging STEPHEN to hurry as they make their way
through the darkening landscape. All kinds of creatures are
appearing around them, and every few yards STEPHEN pauses to
examine something.

                     BLAKENEY
           Sir, you must hurry!

                     STEPHEN
           A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any
           ship's captain.

He's breathing hard, exhausted.

                     BLAKENEY
           You must carry him, Padeen!

PADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries.
                    BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
          Leave them! We must get back to the ship.

STEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is already
divesting PADEEN of his load.

247.        COUNTRYSIDE - LAST LIGHT

PADEEN carrying STEPHEN 'piggy-back', BLAKENEY out ahead
urging them on.

247a   THE DISCARDED COLLECTING BOXES

A variety of small bugs and animals crawling free

248      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair',
gripping the table and BLAKENEY's good arm for support.
Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small
items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and
insects - and places them in ordered piles around his
microscope.

All about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure -
the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of
bare feet on the deck above.

He holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it
with his magnifying glass when JACK enters.

                    JACK
          I forgot to ask you - did you see your
          bird?

STEPHEN's eye grossly enlarged through the lens.

                    STEPHEN
          I did not. My greatest discovery was your
          phantom.

                    JACK
          Indeed it was, I'm sorry...

                    STEPHEN
              (waving the magnifying glass)
          Not a bit of it. William and I made a
          unique discovery.

Handing JACK the jar and magnifying glass.
                     STEPHEN (CONT'D)
           Tell him, Mr. Blakeney.

                     BLAKENEY (beaming)
           It's a rare phasmid, Sir.

JACK inspects the stick. It winks at him.

                        JACK
           A phasmid?

                     BLAKENEY
           It's an insect disguised as a stick.

JACK stares at the creature.

                     BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
           In order to confuse a predator.

JACK looks up at STEPHEN.

249.   BAY, GALAPAGOS - NIGHT

The Surprise alive with crewmen on the deck and in the
rigging. Shouts and commands drift across the water as she
turns and heads out from the bay.

249a         GANGWAY - SAME TIME

JACK strides along the quarterdeck towards the forecastle
issuing a stream of orders -

                     JACK
           Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint
           we have. I want six men with brushes
           slung over the side.
               (moving on)
           Doudle!

                        DOUDLE
           Yessir.

JACK hands him a piece of paper with a sketch on it.

                     JACK
           Get your sail makers working on this.
           Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet
           every seven feet.

                        DOUDLE
            Aye, Sir.

He shouts to HOGG who, with a few men, is manhandling a large
metal cauldron from the ballast to the gun-deck.

                      JACK
                (to HOGG)
            Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire
            in it.
                (shouts)
            Mr. Calamy!

                         CALAMY
            Aye, Sir.

                      JACK
            Once we're underway, replace some of the
            sails with the oldest, most patched set
            we have.

                      CALAMY
            They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll
            need some men to move all the clutter.

                      JACK
            Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The
            more mess the better.

249B.    SIDE OF THE SHIP,. NIGHT

The ship powers ahead as men swing in harnesses above the
racing water, painting out the Nelson chequer.

249C.    ON DECK.   NIGHT

NAGEL positions the great cauldron amidships as men come up
from below with old barrels and bits of rope.

                         CALAMY
            Haul away!

On the gangway, Men under CALAMY's instructions haul on
ropes, pulling up the old patched sails.

The sails lead us up to

250.    CROSSTREES - NIGHT

JACK, PULLINGS and the whaler HOGG scan the dark horizon.

                         HOGG
          There, Sir. A mainmast toplight.

JACK has to use a telescope.

                    JACK
          You've got good eyes, Hogg.

Shouts down to the helm -

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Mr. Bonden, set a course west-south-west.
              (to PULLINGS)
          We'll drop below the horizon and come up
          on the other side of him, let him think
          he's seen us first.

251.        SURPRISE - DAWN

First light reveals the results of an overnight
transformation - from a naval warship to a shambolic-looking
Portuguese whaler.

The gunwales are painted an untidy ochre and the gun-ports
hidden behind broad strips of canvas.

The sails are patched and ragged, the forecastle cluttered
with barrels. Smoke billows from a cauldron amidships.

On deck and in the rigging, there's a quarter of the normal
complement of men, all of them dressed in purser's slops.

252.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

A bemused STEPHEN looks about him as he approaches JACK.

                    STEPHEN
          I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's
          clothing

                    JACK
          A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave
          me the idea.

                    STEPHEN
          I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.

                    JACK
          No? Well this one is.

253.        BERTH DECK - DAWN
HOWARD and his marines change out of their smart uniforms,
into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much
to the amusement of the passing sailors.

                    CREW MEN AD LIB
          Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is
          there a skirt comes with it?

254.        GUN-DECK - DAWN

Men are checking the breechings of the great guns and
chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical,
more deadly.

The armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of
sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at
the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes
at their feet.

Another team check and load pistols by the score.

254.        MIDSHIPMEN'S QUARTERS - DAWN

Alone, BLAKENEY awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from
its scabbard. It glints momentarily in the lamp-light.

CALAMY enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy
when he sees BLAKENEY.

                    BLAKENEY [ ]
          It's all right. Permission to boast.
          You're to lead the boarders from the
          forecastle. Congratulations.

                          CALAMY
          Thank you.

                    BLAKENEY
          You'll make lieutenant out of this.

The others come in.

                    BOYLE
          He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant
          Peter Calamy.

Oohs and aahs from all.

                          BLAKENEY
              [       ]
          Then I'll see you at the forecastle,
          'Lieutenant'.

                    CALAMY
          That's not your station.

BLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his eye.

                    BLAKENEY
          But naturally I'll board with you?

                    CALAMY
          I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders.

BLAKENEY is devastated.

Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement.

                    RYE
          She's seen us!

256.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN

JACK raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly
visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running
up her backstay.

                     MOWETT
          She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give
          the order?

                    JACK
          No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but
          panicky and disorganized, like a whaler
          might do.

Allen smiles at this unintended slight

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          No offence, Mr. Hogg.

257.        WIDE ON THE SHIPS - DAY

A show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away
from the Acheron. As she presents her stern we see her new
name: Malacca.

258.        QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Through his telescope, JACK looks back at the Acheron in
pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck.
                    JACK
              (to Mowett)
          Run up Portuguese colours.
              (then down to the gun-deck)
          Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em.

BLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking
flushed and angry.

                    BLAKENEY
          May I speak with you, Sir.

                    JACK
          No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers
          here.

                    BLAKENEY
          Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding
          party, I wanted to say -

                    JACK
              (interrupts)
          I know what you want to say and my answer
          is no. I promised your mother I would
          return you in one piece and I have
          already failed her on that score. You
          will command a gun and then retire to
          defend the quarterdeck here with Dr.
          Maturin.

                      BLAKENEY
          But sir -

                    JACK (cutting in)
          Go to your station, Mr. Blakeney.

BLAKENEY begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears
burning his eyes.

A moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the
Acheron opens up with her bow-chasers. An 18 pound shot
screams past the side of the Surprise to land with a column
of spray just off their bows.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Good shooting. Remind me to press her bow
          gunner, Mr. Pullings.

The second ball takes down some rigging.
                     JACK (CONT'D)
          Start the water and throw some barrels
          overboard.

He goes below.

259.   WAIST - DAY

Barrels go overboard and pumps spout streams of water over
the side as JACK runs down to

260.   THE GUN-DECK

The great majority of men are gathered here, more than a
hundred of them crammed together with their muskets and
sabres, listening to the odd thump from topsides as another
ball from the Acheron hits home.

CALAMY and his gang of young tykes are squashed in there
somewhere, BOYLE, WILLIAMS, ADDISON and the rest, eyes
shining with nervousness and wild anticipation, as JACK
addresses his men, who shout encouragement, ad lib, in every
pause.

                    JACK
              (plus the men ad lib)
          We're a long way from home. (Right you
          are, Captain!) A long way from anywhere,
          (Too true!) But if Britain rules the
          waves she rules these waves too. (Right
          she does!) And the blow we shall deal for
          his Majesty here will be felt just as
          keenly (I'll say it will) aye - and
          cheered just as loudly ('specially by the
          wimmin!) - as any dealt at Trafalgar or
          Cape St. Vincent.


The camera moves over the upturned faces, PLAICE, NAGEL,
DOUDLE, KILLICK, the midshipmen, the powder-monkeys, the
whole fellowship of the ship. And finally STEPHEN watching
JACK doing what he does best: transmitting his own
fearlessness into other men - the total warrior, the
consummate leader.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I don't say it will be easy. She's twice
          the men we have and they'll sell their
          lives dearly. But every man here is worth
          three of Boney's privateers, and I know
          there's not a faint heart among you.
CALAMY pipes up -

                    CALAMY
          Three cheers for the Captain.

                    MEN (deafening)
          Huzzah huzzah huzzah!

On CALAMY, cheering like a kid at a football match as...

261.          QUARTERDECK - DAY

Another well-placed shot from the Acheron smashes through the
rigging, sending down a shower of rope and cordage.

JACK is back at his station by the wheel, the Acheron little
more than a half a mile astern, the figure of the captain in
his black coat clearly visible.

JACK studies the looming black vessel, then turns and crosses
to BONDEN at the helm. BONDEN nods, lifting his hands from
the wheel as JACK grips the curved timber decisively, taking
the strain.

He feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up
to the sails then back to the Acheron. STEPHEN appears beside
him, casually smoking a cigar. He offers one to Jack, who
declines

                     [   ]

Another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them, but
neither man flinches. KILLICK appears with two cups of
coffee, and in his belt a brace of pistols.

                    KILLICK
          I took the liberty, Doctor.

                     STEPHEN
          [    ] Thank you, Killick.

JACK steers one-handed as he sips his coffee.

                    JACK
          Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in
          order.

Another shot through the sails.

                     MOWETT
           A poem, Sir?
                             [   ]
               (after a moment's reflection)
           'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art,
           To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,

A ball goes howling past the ship, MOWETT winces.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)
           Then might I, with unrivalled strains,
           deplore,
           Th'impervious horrors of a leeward
           shore.'

JACK smiles, nods.

                     MOWETT (CONT'D)
           'Transfixed with terror at th'approaching
           doom...'

                        JACK
           What!

                     MOWETT
               (apologetic)
           ...they were only people of the merchant
           service, of-course, Sir.

262.   P.O.V. ACHERON

She's now less than five hundred yards from their stern, and
gaining.

263.    QUARTERDECK

JACK turns back to MOWETT.

                     JACK
           We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the
           Portuguese colours and run up the Jack...
           Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports,
           and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away
           aloft.

The British Jack rises to the masthead replacing the
Portuguese colours, as PULLINGS descends to the gun-deck.

264. SHIP'S SIDE -

The black muzzles appear with a low rumbling sound, as
265.   QUARTERDECK

JACK, with a wink to MOWETT, yells at the top of his voice

                       JACK
             Helm's a lee!

....and spins the wheel hard to starboard.

266.   THE SURPRISE

Wide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of
the oncoming Acheron.

267.   POV ACHERON DAY

Confused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her
forecastle, somewhere a drum beating.

270.   THE SURPRISE QUARTERDECK - DAY

JACK hands the wheel to BONDEN.

                       JACK
             Run us down her larboard side then cut
             across her wake!
                 (shouts down to the gun deck)
             Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're
             broadside on!

271. - THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

Wide, to see the Surprise turning downwind, back towards the
Acheron, so they will pass broadside to broadside [   ] no
more than thirty yards apart.

272. QUARTERDECK/ GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

Through a furious exchange of musket fire JACK runs down the
ladder to the gun-deck-

                       JACK
             Fire as she bears! Every gun to
             concentrate on her mainmast!

Through the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes
visible. Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the
crews are unprepared and disorganized.
                      PULLINGS
            On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as
            you sight her!

As the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron
becomes visible.

273. THE SURPRISE GUNS

Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame
spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising.

274.    VIEW OF THE ACHERON

With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls,
dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling
over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports.

275. GUNDECK/QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE -

Cheers from the crew. Jack yelling up the companionway

                      JACK
            Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard!

276.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous
dragging weight of their mainmast.

BONDEN wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the
exposed, vulnerable stern.

277.    DELETED

277A.   GUNDECK, SURPRISE

                      JACK
            Fire at will!

278.    GUN-DECK, SURPRISE

In random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the
Acheron's stern. Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood
and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now
open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past.

279.    QUARTERDECK

JACK climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to BONDEN -
                      JACK
            Lay me alongside!

280.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON

The bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships,
spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at
point-blank range.

The crew throw grappling hooks.

281..   QUARTERDECK

                      JACK
            Boarders away!

And he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following
after him.

282.    FORECASTLE

CALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and
forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging
their blades.

283.    QUARTERDECK

An agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside
STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men,
ready to ferry the wounded below.

284.    ON THE ACHERON

As the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face
withering fire from the enemy. A dozen men go down, some of
them fatally wounded. Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and
HORNER in quick succession.

The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back
at them.

JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine,
TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot.

LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to
devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS
protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the
hip.

JACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling,
swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other
with barely room to fall.

The Acherons are gradually forced back across their
quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship.

285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON

JACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy
pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through
the sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK
and killing the pikeman.

To either side, privateers are trying to reach them,
shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.

Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and
foe alike.

KILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and
from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.

AWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-
cleaver right and left.

286.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

A commander of the privateers notes the poorly defended
Surprise, and leads a counter-attack over onto her
quarterdeck.

                     CALAMY
           Look to our quarter-deck!

287. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

BLAKENEY, dirk in hand, turns to face them, as does HOWARD
and his men, but they are gravely outnumbered.

288.   FORECASTLE, ACHERON

CALAMY sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the
Surprise, calling for others to follow.

                     Calamy
           This way! Follow me!

289. QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

STEPHEN, PADEEN and JOE PLAICE appear from below. STEPHEN
picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer
lunging at CAPTAIN HOWARD. The man drops, a neat hole in his
forehead. A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's
surprising skill.

CALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees
stabbing at the legs of the attackers.

290.   WAIST, ACHERON

JACK, BONDEN and DAVIES are driving a wedge toward the stern,
the defenders falling back in disarray.

291.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

PULLINGS and MOWETT fight side-by-side.

A swivel-gun mounted on the taff-rail is swung to face them.

The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket
ball hits him, again fired by STEPHEN.

292.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE/ACHERON

CALAMY, BLAKENEY and their group force the counter-attack
back onto the deck of the Acheron. The two boys fight as a
team as they move toward the stern.

292.   SIDE OF THE ACHERON

Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack.
Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall.

293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON

JEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the
grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale.

294.   IN THE WATER

Oil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,
clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.

295.   WAIST OF THE SHIP

Cheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many
languages, some beg for mercy, others fight on.

296.   BELOW DECKS

JACK moves alone, down to the berth deck. He smashes the
chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.

Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's
stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.

He makes his way through to the Great Cabin.

297.   GREAT CABIN, ACHERON

Four privateers look up as JACK bursts in.

They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of
them are too drunk to be scared.

                      JACK
           Where is your captain? Ou est votre
           capitaine?

One man leaps out through the shattered windows. A couple of
others raise their hands and start jabbering in French and
Spanish.

298.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

It's all over for the Acherons as a French officer hauls down
their colours.

A cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY
and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured
flag.

A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre.
BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow.

299.   IN THE SICK-BERTH, ACHERON

A doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody
apron, red-eyed from fatigue.

JACK enters, a fearsome sight, with his singed yellow hair
and blood-stained cutlass.

                     JACK
           Le Capitaine? Where is he?

The doctor points at a body on the operating table.

JACK approaches, looks down at the dead man. He's [ ]
somewhere about JACK's age, fine-featured, with his black
coat draped over his body.
                     DOCTOR
           Il mávait prie de vous donner ceci.

Passing JACK the captain's sword.

300.   QUARTERDECK, ACHERON

JACK picks his way through the dead and wounded to where
CALAMY sits nursing BLAKENEY.

                     CALAMY
           He's dead, sir.

Gently, JACK picks up the lifeless body and walks slowly back
down the quarterdeck, the boy draped across his arms.

Friend and foe part silently in front of him as he crosses
the gangway to...

301.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE

...then with CALAMY following, he goes below.

302.   THE GREAT CABIN - DAY

JACK in wide shot, sitting alone on the bench running under
the stern windows. His hunched posture and red tear-stained
eyes give a glimpse of his familiar post-battle mood - a mix
of grief and depression, the old question, "Was it worth the
price?".

                                                 FADE TO BLACK

                                                 FADE UP ON -

303.         ACHERON AND SURPRISE - DAWN

The two ships anchored close together on the ocean.

304.         QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAWN

As eight bells are rung for the change of watch we see a row
of canvas hammocks each containing the body of a fallen
crewman.

DAVIES and PLAICE stitch the bodies into their hammocks,
BLAKENEY the last body in the line. As the men approach -

                     CALAMY
           I'll do it.
JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him
alone.

As CALAMY sews up the hammock, HOLLAR's voice is heard
distinctly from below.

                    HOLLAR (O.S.)
          Rise and shine, show a leg there. Tumble
          up! Tumble up!

In close-up: the peaceful face of BLAKENEY

                    HOLLAR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Sleepers awake!

...as CALAMY's hands stitch the canvas closed.

305.        WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - DAWN

The small figures of the crew assembled on the quarterdeck.
JACK's voice drifting across the water.

                    JACK
          John Henry ALLEN...
          Joseph NAGEL...
          William Horner...
          Stephen Winston Boyle...
          and Lieutenant William Blakeney

          We therefore commit their bodies to the
          deep, looking for the resurrection of the
          body, when the sea shall give up her
          dead...
          Amen.

                    ALL
          Amen.

The bodies in their weighted hammocks slide into the sea.

306.        BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY

Wide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two
dolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various
features of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to
take the boy's mind off the loss of his friend.

307.   THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON - DAY

The two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts
jury-rigged.

308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY

JACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals
midshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron.

                    JACK
          Signal... 'Parole prisoners
          Valparaiso'...

                    WILLIAMSON
          You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir?

                    JACK
          No. Captain Pullings.

WILLIAMSON hurries to the signals locker, the signal book and
JACK's message in his hand.

309.   TELESCOPE POV   DAY

The line of colored signal-flags run up to the mast-head of
the Surprise.

309A   QUARTERDECK ACHERON

Midshipman Rye is reading the signal for Pullings

                    RYE
          ....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God-
          speed, Captain Pullings.'

A contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is
confirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a
sharp turn away from the Surprise.

311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK

Slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and
routines reassert themselves.

· Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck
composing a poem in memory of the battle.

· JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to
a small attentive audience.

· While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about
BECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way
around most of his torso.

· BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures
collected at the Galapagos, as...

Stephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently.

313.   INTERIOR, GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

STEPHEN plays a note on his cello [      ]

                    STEPHEN
          Shall we begin?

JACK pauses, gazing into space.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Jack, brother, you're gathering wool.

                    JACK (smiles)
          Thinking about their captain. A great
          seaman, whatever you may say of him. The
          doctor said he was killed by our first
          broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him,
          face to face.

                    STEPHEN
          Maybe you did.

                      JACK
          What?

                    STEPHEN
          While I was tending the prisoners they
          told me their doctor died of fever, two
          weeks ago. There was no doctor on that
          ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you
          will find one there now.

JACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of
water flowing gently past the hull.

He looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the
thought of a possible final deception flooding through him.

                      STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          Shall we?
He starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello
carrying through to ....

312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT

KILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is
preparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL.

                     KILLICK
           That's the last of the cheese and like as
           not they'll leave it seizing to their
           plates with their tweedly tweedly
           tweedly.

                     JACK (O.S.)
           Killick? KILLICK THERE!

                     KILLICK (projecting)
           Which it will be ready when it's ready!

In the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling,
undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through
the great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far
away. Jack breaks off abruptly:

                      JACK

          You're still missing your cormorant...
          flightless eh...well then. It will still
          be there when we come back

And he breaks into a merry jig

313.   SURPRISE, EXTERIOR - NIGHT

Wide, to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding
water lit by the great stern lantern. Through the casement
windows the two men can be seen playing.

Wider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around,
with the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly
visible in the darkness.

314.   FURTHER BACK

And further still. Until we see the curve of the earth, and
the planet spinning on its journey through space.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          A young man, FREDDIE SUTTON (early 20s)_ speaks to a

                         DOCTOR;

                         DOCTOR
          What are you going to do when you get out
          of here? You're going to have to wear a
          belt for six months, maybe a year...

                         FREDDIE
          What kind of belt?

                         DOCTOR
          A surgical belt. You won't be able to do
          very heavy lifting.

                         FREDDIE
          .I try to stay away from that.

                         DOCTOR
          But you spend time outdoors.

                         FREDDIE

                         MMMM

                         DOCTOR
          What do you do?

                         FREDDIE

                         DOCTOR
          You didn't have very much on you when you
          were admitted. Where were you going?

                         FREDDIE
          I was on my way to Placerville. To the
          Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a
          friend of mine. He doesn't know where I
          am.

                         DOCTOR
          How old are you, Freddie?

                         FREDDIE

          28.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         DOCTOR
          Why don't you turn honest?
          You seem like an intelligent fellow.
          'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?

                         FREDDIE
          It's a weakness. But I like it.

                         DOCTOR
          I know what the other is too.

                         FREDDIE
          How can you tell that? I'm clean.

                         DOCTOR
          The tattoo's.

                         FREDDIE
          Is that a weakness...

                         DOCTOR
          No one ever made money chasing girls.

                         FREDDIE
          You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie.

                         DOCTOR
          Who's that?

                         FREDDIE
          My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But
          that doesn't mean I don't have a
          weakness...

                         DOCTOR
          College?

                         FREDDIE
          I tried that, it didn't work.

                         DOCTOR
          Why'd you leave?

                         FREDDIE
          Sometimes my hypo's get the best of
          me, I really feel like walking into the
          street and hitting people's hats off.

                         DOCTOR
          That's how you end up like this. With a
          burst appendix.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         FREDDIE
          That's when I know it's time to get to
          the sea.. what kind of belt?

                         DOCTOR
          A medical belt. Similar for lifting.
          You're going to need some money. What do
          you plan to do?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm going to pay back the hospital. And
          you.

                         DOCTOR
          You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical
          duty. But you're expected to pay the
          hospital for medicines. And your belt.

                         FREDDIE
          Alright. I intend to do that. You saying
          you have a job for me? What? As an
          orderly?

                         DOCTOR
          You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much
          lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have
          to learn. But maybe you could run an
          elevator, something of that sort.

                         FREDDIE
          I want to get out of here, but I also
          like it here. You think I was gonna die?

                         DOCTOR
          I know you were, Freddie.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't
          save me... . but...I can't seem to die.

                         DOCTOR
          Too lucky?

                         FREDDIE
          Something like that.

                         DOCTOR
          Were you in the service?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes, sir.

                         DOCTOR
          Navy?

                         FREDDIE

                         DOCTOR

                         FREDDIE

                         DOCTOR
          Your luck was up this time, Freddie. You
          should have seen the pus in your belly.
          Something to think about.
          It's not too late to stop being a
          weisnheimer, no matter what you think.
          you're still a young man.

          Freddie walks into the alley, stuffing some money in his
          pockets - he's followed by a FIGURE. FREDDIE realizes,
          stops, SPINS AROUND AND PULLS KNIFE:

                         FREDDIE
          You come any closer and I'll slice your

          talk with you -

                         FREDDIE
          You can talk standing in front of the
          restaurant, around the corner --
          At that moment, TWO OTHER MEN come out of the shadows and

          JUMP FREDDIE, KNOCK HIM AROUND, TAKE HIS MONEY AND LEAVE.
          He's left a little bloody, messy, no money in the alley.

          THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION .AND REALIZES HE MAY/DOES

          HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS...
          .he backs away quietly-and starts to THROW SOME

          THINGS INTO A BAG...

          .WHEN SOME OF THE FILIPINO'S NOTICE HIM STARTING TO

          LEAVE, THEY YELL AFTER HIM...

          .FREDDIE TAKES OFF...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          AND THE FILIPINO'S GIVE CHASE.. .THEY MOVE INTO THE FARM

          FIELDS.

          EXTEND OUT. CHASE THROUGH THE FIELDS FREDDIE JUST RUNNING

          AND RUNNING AS FAST AS HE CAN...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER.

          LATER. off the side of the highway. Freddie collects
          himself, obviously running for the past hour and evading
          the Filipino's.
          He hitches now...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. DOCKS/SAN FRANCISCO - HIRING HALL - NIGHT.

          Inside the crowded HIRING HALL, sailors, men looking for
          work, etc. Freddie puts his name down. This is a short
          burst of a scene, establish he wants to get back to sea,
          wants work, but there's nothing for a few weeks.

          EXT. DOCKS/SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT.

          VARIOUS ANGLES. Freddie makes his way around the docks,
          looking for something/anything. PLAY OUT.
          He comes across a SHIP that's being readied for voyage.
          It's an old cattle TRAWLER that seems converted to some
          kind of CRUISE SHIP/PRIVATE YACHT-type vessel.
          There's a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a
          minor cocktail party in progress. (light music playing
          from the ship...) DECKHANDS preparing to ship out, etc...
          Freddie approaches the gang-plank...no one is there to
          guard it. He walks straight up the gang plank and gets on
          board the ship.

          ANGLE, ON BOARD.
          CAMERA follows him around... no one seems to notice or
          care...
          He goes down below...

          ANGLE, BELOW DECK.
          He sneaks around... some YOUNG MEN are getting dressed in

          TUXEDOS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          This plays itself out...FREDDIE finds a small CLOSET with
          a TUXEDO and slips it on. He gets swallowed up into this
          group of young men and acts as if he belongs --

          .THE SHIP PULLS AWAY. HEADING OUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY...

          .FREDDIE HEADING UP INTO A WELL APPOINTED CABIN...

          A COCKTAIL PARTY IS IN FULL SWING AS THE SHIP LEAVES S.F.
          There are all manner of people here, in this area,
          everyone seems quite happy, chatty. Middle aged couples,
          single middle-aged men, young couples, some kids,
          teenagers, etc.
          Freddie working near the bar, starts delivering drinks...
          A live PIANO TRIO playing. FREDDIE NOTICES:
          A LARGE MAN IN HIS MID-40s, all red-hair, red eyebrows,
          red lips sings and dances while holding a baby It's a
          bit blurry across the room from Freddie's POV
          The SONG ENDS and everyone laughs, applauds, collapses.
          KIDS run around...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MAIN DINNER CABIN. LATER.

          Everyone seated for DINNER; we now see the red haired man
          in full: MASTER OF CEREMONIES (early 40s)
           He sits at the head of the table, his family with him:
          HIS WIFE: MARY SUE (pregnant, mid-20s) HIS DAUGHTERS:

          ELIZABETH (18) ELENA (3) SUSANAH (1) HIS SON: VAL (20)
          A RIGHT HAND MAN TO MASTER IS: NORMAN CONRAD (40s)

          ANGLE, THE BAR.
          The BARTENDER whispers to Freddie; indicates he's POURED
          TWO SHOTS FOR THEM TO SNEAK ... FREDDIE and the BARTENDER
          reach and grab them, shoot them back...

          INSTANTLY, FREDDIE'S HEAD POUNDS.

                         BARTENDER
          You feel alright?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah, fine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         ANOTHER SERVER
          Why don't you go lay down, I'll take
          over...
          Freddie walks off. FREDDIE doesn't seem DRUNK he SEEMS
          DRUGGED. He walks down the hall - AND IN AN INSTANT FALLS
          FLAT ON HIS FACE. DEAD WEIGHT. He's dragged off.

          FADE OUT.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. SMALL DARK ROOM - LATER.

          FREDDIE wakes up MASTER OF CEREMONIES is here along with
          MARY SUE and NORMAN CONRAD does the speaking at first,
          Freddie in and out of consciousness:

                         FREDDIE

          Freddie is already sitting in a chair they have him in.

                          FREDDIE (CONT'D)
          Whatdchu put in my drink?

                         NORMAN CONRAD

                         FREDDIE
          I'm sleepy.

          Master fiddles around with his things, belongings,
          wallet, out on a table. He looks at the FLASK. Smells it.
          Pours the contents into a glass; looks at the liquid.

          Morning sun comes in, hits him in the face. Wakes him up.
          He looks around. He looks out the window.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY - SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

          FREDDIE walks out, looks around. . .he walks down the hall,
          a YOUNG GIRL passes him, smiles wide and says "GOOD
          MORNING," ad keeps walking...
          He moves towards a room where he hears a TYPEWRITER. He
          steps in the doorway. MASTER sits at his desk, writing
          gear all around. MASTER looks up, sees him, stops
          typing...
          Smiles. Extends his arm out for Freddie to come in and
          take a seat.. .MASTER is warm, inviting. Not rushed. They
          sort of sit and settle with each a moment;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         MASTER
          Ok?

                         FREDDIE
          Alright.

                         MASTER
          You can't be...

                         FREDDIE
          Is this your ship?

                         MASTER
          I'm it's Commander, yes.

                         FREDDIE
          Where's it going?

                         MASTER
          New York City thru the canal. You're
          seamen?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         MASTER
          You're looking for work?

                         FREDDIE
          .what did I say last night...?

                         MASTER
          You said you were an able bodied seamen
          and you were looking for work?

                         FREDDIE
          You have any?

                         MASTER
          Perhaps.

                         FREDDIE
          What was in my drink?

                         MASTER
          You were sedated with chloral hydrate and
          bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if
          your check your butt-hole you'll find
          it's all in working order (he he he...)
          Isn't that what all men are worried about
          in they surrender themselves.

                         FREDDIE
          I didn't surrender myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         MASTER
          You were acting very aggressive because
          you drank too much alcohol.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think I was.

                         MASTER
          Yes I think you were. And I don't like
          strange boys jumping on my ship.

                         FREDDIE
          So what are you gonna do?

                         MASTER
          Why don't you just ask for work? Work
          can't be hard to find.

                         FREDDIE
          Depends on when you're ready to go...do
          you have a job for me.

                         MASTER
          You can't work in your condition.

                         FREDDIE
          What condition is that?

                         MASTER
          You're aberrated.

                         FREDDIE
          What's that mean?

                         MASTER
          A wandering from the path
          The problems you have in your life (your
          appendix, your work, your need to batter
          your body with booze...) I resolve that
          they can be fixed.

                         FREDDIE
          I've got no trouble. You got a job for me
          to do, I can do it.

                         MASTER
          Maybe I do, but not the kind you think.

                         FREDDIE
          Do you own this ship?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         MASTER
          A charter though the Explorer's Club.

                         FREDDIE
          .What do you do?

                         MASTER
          I am many things. I am writer, a doctor,
          a nuclear physicist, a theoretical
          philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A
          hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like
          you.

                         FREDDIE
          Where's your money come from?

                         MASTER
          Many years of successful writing and
          publishing has made me self sufficient.
          Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my
          work - but now I'm retired to study the
          mid and the spirit...my life's true work.

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          These studies have made me a target and I
          am hunted for what I know. Which is
          why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and
          jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know
          what your motives are?

                         FREDDIE
          .well: I apologize if I got a little
          out of hand last night - I'm just...
          looking for work and your ship looked
          good, so...it's a nice looking ship.

                         MASTER
          Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How
          I miss the days of working a four
          mastered schooner with nothing but salt
          horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of
          water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem
          so much more fragile, don't you think?
          You - you're and adventurer.

                         FREDDIE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MASTER
          An able bodied seamen, a maker of wine,
          and a dashing mischievousness is what I
          knew would come to me in this-lifetime.
          .would you study with me? Submit
          yourself?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't understand what you're talking
          about.

                         MASTER
          I am always looking for mature men of
          unusual ability who are willing to
          stretch the boundaries of what they know.
          To increase knowing-ness and
          communication amongst man. I need day-ta.
          And with your help, I can gather it...

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          You already understand, you just need to
          remember. And only say yes. Say, 'yes.'

                         FREDDIE
          I'm not saying yes to anything I don't

                         UNDERSTAND --
          Master holds up the FLASK..

                         MASTER
          What's-about-this?'

                         FREDDIE
          What about it?

                         MASTER
          As a Scientist and a Conniseur I have no
          idea the contents of this remarkable
          potion, what's in it.

                         FREDDIE
          Secrets.

                         MASTER
          Can you make more?

                         FREDDIE

                         MAYBE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         MASTER
          I'll grant you a full reprive from your
          naughtiness as a stow-away if you make us
          some more. I must admit I sampled some
          and ended up drinking it all.

                         FREDDIE
          It's just booze.

                         MASTER
          Horrible Hooch?

                         FREDDIE
          Horrible Hooch.
          BEAT. They both smile, laugh a little. MASTER gets up and
          comes over him...

                         MASTER
          Would you scrub yourself up and make
          yourself clean?
          My daughter is getting married.
          Come and join us and leave your worries
          for a while, they'll still be there when
          you get back..he he he. You are invited.

                         FREDDIE
          Oh yeah?

                         MASTER
          It will come out over time, but yes. We
          are re-united... do you reember me?

                         FREDDIE
          .I don't know...

                         MASTER
          That's alright. Don't strain yourself.
          You will. There will be much time to
          discuss this on the journey to our
          destination. As we travel down Time-
          Holes...you won't be afraid will you?

                         FREDDIE

          Have you ever had harm cme to you?

                         FREDDIE
          Sure.

                         MASTER
          What if we could return to a period of
          your life where there was harm and do
          away with it? .would You like that?

                         FREDDIE
          Ok.

          INT. DINNER CABIN. NIGHT.

          It's mid-dinner, post-wedding ceremony party, everyone is
          celebrating, drinking. Master talking a blue streak,
          acting this out.

                         MASTER
          Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it
          comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE

          DRAGON, TEETH AND BLOOD DRIPPING! RED

          EYES!
          What do I go? A lasoooo! Whip it up, wrap
          it around it's neck. I wrastle, wrastle,
          wrastle'em to the ground - I snap up, I
          say: sit.
          Everyone laughs, Master is acting all this out, rolling
          around, etc as if he's training a dog...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays.
          So now he's got a leash on and he's
          staying on my command - THAT"S WHAT WHERE
          WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on
          command.
          Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances;

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Next we're gonna teach it to roll over
          and play DEAD.
          Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his
          days studying Judo ...
          FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the
          table is: VAL, strikes up conversation:

                         VAL
          Freddie, I'm Val, the son.

                         FREDDIE
          Hello.

                         VAL
          Are you having a good time?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         VAL
          What are you goign to be working on?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't really know.

                         VAL
          Have you done any time-hole work?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think so.
          VAL is distracted by a WELL WISHER who comes over.
          FREDDIE looks around at everyone. All the faces having a
          good time and celebrating...
          He catches the eye of a YOUNG WOMAN. . .then sees her

          HUSBAND...
          The BARTENDER comes over to FREDDIE

                         BARTENDER
          Alright, old man?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah.

                         BARTENDER
          No hard feelings?

                         FREDDIE
          No.

                         BARTENDER
          Welcome aboard. Clif Amsbury.
          He serves him a drink.

                         BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          This one's alright. Chink, chink.

          ANGLE, LATER.
          Master is saying good-night to everyone, passes FREDDIE
          and says quietly:

                         MASTER
          When can we have some of your potion?

                         FREDDIE
          Whenever you'd like. I'll get making it -

                         MASTER
          When I'd like it - I will give you a
          signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my
          nose. What will you need?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         FREDDIE
          I'll take care of it.
          MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye
          to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by

          Enough! Enough! I must get back to work!
          Keep going! Dont stop all night long!
          He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it
          all.

          INT. ROOM - LATER.

          Freddie comes down into his little room. A cot has been
          made for him, some fresh clothes and a BOOK
          (hardcover,400pages) on the bed. It reads, very simply:

                         THE CAUSE

          CU. BOOK "THE CAUSE"
          The cover is opened, CAMERA SEES IN CU the opening line
          from the book: "Shall a man be master of his memories? Or
          shall his memories be the master?"

          ANGLE, FREDDIE
          He lays in bed and reads the book. He reads about to
          lines and his eyes slam shit, asleep, still holding the
          book.

          HOLD.

          It's the next morning, EVERYONE IS HERE FOR BREAKFAST,
          BUFFET STYLE, FREDDIE mixed in amongst it all.
          FREDDIE sits down to eat with MARY SUE, who feeds her
          baby. The other children around. VAL and NORMAN CONRAD
          are here...

                         MARY SUE
          He's been writing all night ...I think
          you've inspired something in hi,. When
          we're at home, on land, there's too much,
          pulling him in each direction.

          28.

          MARY SUE (CONT'D)
          He was working on a book that showed how
          the Russians used narcosynthesis and
          physical torture and how it worked as it
          did. That was interrupted.
          He had a technology oh psychological
          warfare to present to the Defense
          Department. All that was interrupted,
          lost. Each time he sits to write, a new
          attack is launched against him and he
          spends too much time on defending
          himself. I tell him to ignore it, but
          he's so sensitive...

                         FREDDIE
          Who's attacking him?

                         MARY SUE
          People that are scared. People that are
          greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice
          about being at sea. He gets his studies
          done, advances the learning, and he
          writes BOOK II.

                         FREDDIE
          What's a time-hole?

          DUNBAR (late 20s) are on stage. She is lying down, eyes
          close, he is sitting in a chair next to her, students
          watch as he runs an exercise with her; Mary Sue has
          brought Freddie in here and sits with him in the

                         WAYNE
          Say, "back beyond" and return to the pre-

          Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.
          Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.

          I hear a voice..It's my father's voice.

          Listen to the words and repeat them,
          please.

                         SUSAN
          He is talking to my mother. The face
          pressure is hurting. It's uncomfortable.
          It keeps going up and down and it hurts.

                         WAYNE
          Repeat his words, please.

                         SUSAN
          "I don't want to come in you now. Let's
          wait." The pressure is banging my face.
          Into my face. My mother is there, her
          voice...

                         WAYNE
          What is your mother saying? Please, if
          you hear her?

                         SUSAN
          She saying "well get out of there then. I
          don't want you in me at all if your not
          there to come. Get in to come." She's
          mad.

                         WAYNE
          Please return to the start of this and
          recount.

                         SUSAN
          I wonder what they're doing? I hear a
          squishing sounds and it's wet. Oh. Oh my.

                         WAYNE
          Recount please.

                         SUSAN
          A faint rhythm ...then faster. I hear my
          fathers voice say, "oh honey..I wont come
          in you now. I'm not too sure I like
          children that well and I have my job to
          worry about..." And my mother must shove
          him - a sharper pain here - "THEN I DON'T

          IN THERE AT ALL, GET OUT.."

          .someone came up to me the other day,
          and I had to say...I had to correct him.
          He said, "I heard the Cause can fix me.."
          I looked down at him and he'd lost his
          legs. He's sitting in a wheel chair and
          had no legs to speak of. I said, "We can
          do very many things, sir...but no, we
          cannot replace your legs. This is how
          rumors get started." Let's talk about
          what we can do...
          FREDDIE looks around and watches all the STUDENTS on
          their headphones. He tries to flirt and make eye contact
          with all the WOMEN.

          MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          When did you decide you had limited
          potentials and capabilities? You've
          forgotten that this is all just a dirty

          .I don't know. . .you keep asking me..no,
          not really.

          Is your life a constant struggle for
          survival?

                         FREDDIE
          .not really ... .. life's alright.

                         MASTER
          Would you rather give orders than take
          them?

                         FREDDIE
          Sure.

                         MASTER
          Are you often impulsive in you behaviour.

                         FREDDIE
          .sure... Yes.

                         MASTER
          Do other people interest you very much?

                         FREDDIE
          Not really (girls? They do)

                         MASTER
          Do you find it easy to be impartial?

                         FREDDIE
          Yeah.

                         MASTER
          Are you likely to be jealous?

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          Are you logical and scientific in your
          thinking?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm..I don't know. Don't care about
          science.

                         MASTER
          Do you rarely suspect the actions of
          others?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't understand.

                         FREDDIE
          .I suspect people...yes. Sure. So...no,
          rarely. Most people are ass's anyway.

                         MASTER
          Are you usually truthful to others?

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          Are your actions considered unpredictable
          by other people?
          HOLD. HOLD. Freddie seems to think about this questions
          seriously, THEN: OUT OF THE PAUSE AND OUT OF THE BLUE HE

                         MASTER
          Silly..its good to laugh in
          processing.. sometimes we forget.
          Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth:

          He CLICKS it off. Smiles at Freddie; he gives him a
          comforting hug.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Should we sample another sip before we
          join them upstairs?

                         FREDDIE
          Is that it?

                         MASTER

          Do you believe that God will save you
          from your own ridiculousness and self
          contempt?

                         MASTER (CONT'D)

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Let me just listen to this tape...
          He picks up the tape and lifts it to his ear..he wiggles
          it around next to his ear..

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Can't hear anything. But there's sound on
          here, no? Sound to be found?
          He puts the tape reels onto the player...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          This should do it!
          He flips the switch. Nothing. No sound.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Hmmmm. Can' thear anything. Wait. There
          are sounds on this tape, but I can't
          hear... wait... how about this...
          Nothing. He continues this ...he plugs the speakers
          in.. . nothing again and again.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Well what do we have? We have the high
          fidelity audio tape, we have speakers,
          and yet..a ha! Just a moment.
          He turns the machine "ON"...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          This should do it...
          Nothing.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Seems we're out of pieces..
          Everyone laughs nervously...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          I know there's sound on that tape...
          He plugs the power cord into the wall... It crackles and
          sound pours out.. It's MASTER'S VOICE.

          MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Our life has never stopped and always
          been. All of the recordings of our
          lifetimes that we have lived are
          available to us..
          MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY. GENTLE PIANO MUSIC. MASTER turns
          the volume down on the reel-to-reel, speaks live to the

                         PARTY:

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Everything's there isn't it? On the tape?
          Sure is, we just need to get it working
          with all the other pieces in synch-ro-
          nization. No good if it's not plugged
          into the wall. Can't hear it. But the
          sounds are still there. No good if those
          speakers aren't there. Can't hear it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          But that doesn't mean it's not there,
          does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy
          little piece of tape is just nothin'
          without all the other equipment lined up
          properly, isn't it? We CAN access the
          past, traumas and seeds that abberate us
          in present time and once we access them -
          we challenge them and throw them away.
          Previously, I'd established how to access
          these aberrations and painful memories to
          pre-birth/cellular times.
          But the new studies prove there is a time
          beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which
          we are now working. At last count,
          perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our
          studies show...
          Besides the everyday struggles of how we
          become better, more able, more productive
          homo sapiens, the uses for this new
          science is the location and removal of
          certain leukemias, apathies, manics.
          Depressives, perverts, stuttering,
          neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas.
          This is the province and science of
          Cause.
          If you'll forgive me, I must sit down.
          Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg
          injury and limp damndest thing. You see
          it happens every time I come to Manhattan
          Island, its a wound I've never conquered
          and I'll tell you how I found out about,
          because I never knew what in the H was
          happening...
          Well I did some processing to find out.
          Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me
          back...we processed over three hours! And
          something came up. It was this:
          I lived a life before and suffered a
          great injury. Knee injury...
          It was just around 1888. A great number
          and year. Significant as the creation .
          year of the new york city sewer system if
          I'm not wrong...
          I was a thief and criminal, working late
          into the night robbing a bank in the
          western side of the island.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          The crime was committed with a revolver
          in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I
          made it clear across town when we were
          ambushed by the local authorities.
          -- but I made a slip away. A digression
          into the under constructed sewer system.
          It was here that I could no be found - or
          so my thinking went. All my confidence
          and all my arrogance was brought upon me.
          Full in the face. For I was nose to nose
          with a twenty-five foot alligator in the
          New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a
          scare I was in for. Now if you've veer
          seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR -
          you'll remember the fear.
          You see, this being an island, and in
          those days more inhabited by creature
          than man, why wouldn't I meet such a
          beast?
          In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The
          money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not
          dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented
          drain hole just around 125th
          Street... present day Harlem County I
          believe today. Yes. Yes.
          I stuffed it and made a getaway from both
          man and beast âshattered my knee in five
          different places-turned into a piece of
          glass..woke up early in the morning
          somewhere near the present day Times
          Square-which was nothing more than a
          farm..quite a farm..but that's another
          story.
          So what does this say? Injuries stay with
          us don't they??..They sure do. How's it
          gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna
          fix this knee. How are any of us going to
          get better? More able?
          We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This
          Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is
          not enough. We have Lived Many, Many,
          Many Lives. So anybody tat is not
          processing the whole of time - is doing a
          disservice to man and Will Not Get
          Better. I cannot put it more simply.

          And as for me now: I just need to find
          the time away from all of my writing to
          go back down and DO IT so I don't walk
          around with the darndest limp everytime I
          come to town!
          This story is greeted. with equal parts

          Some of this seems quite like hypnosis,
          is it not?

                         MASTER
          Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the
          reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is
          un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow
          him to raise his awareness and IQ.

                         JOHN MORE
          What is the difference between this and
          psychotherapy?

                         MASTER
          Yes. Well. They are very different. No.
          Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no,
          no. Don't associate us with such people!
          That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad
          manner don't you know? I mean at that
          business about sex and all that. That's
          for the neurotic or the person who is
          insane or something like that. That's
          nothing to do with us. They've failed.
          That's for the fortunate few who can
          afford the fees.

                         JOHN MORE
          But some of this does in fact seem to
          share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and
          modern psychotherapy, does it not?

                         MASTER
          No it does not. This is an exact science,
          you see. Comparable to physics or
          chemistry - but simpler. It's
          engineering. Herr Freud had his chance
          and contributed some very workable data,
          but in the end, he failed. So that's
          that.

                         JOHN MORE
          And how long does this take?

                         MASTER
          That depends. But it can be quite fast.
          Quite fast. Or it can take some time.
          Sometimes less than 36 hours.

                         JOHN MORE
          36 hours? And you're saying that these
          methods can cure leukemia according to
          your book and what you've just said?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         MASTER
          Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested.
          22 cases cured. Those are the results.

                         JOHN MORE
          You can understand scepticism, can you
          not?

                         MASTER
          Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to
          be expected and welcome. For without it
          we'd be positive's with no negatives -
          therefore zero. charge. We must have it.

                         JOHN MORE
          Are you a religious people?

                         MASTER
          We are not incorporated as a religion,
          no. But remember this: that religion has
          come uniformly from a philosophy.
          Philosophy is senior to religion. You
          could call us a religion of religions.

                         JOHN MORE
          Are you saying then that any religion is
          rather narrow in its outlook?

                         MASTER
          No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's
          belief's, but religions in general can be
          pre-occupied with a God or Idol or
          something of some such nature who is
          merely trying to fill the universe with a
          lot of little replicas of himself - we
          are trying to free the individual - not
          bend to a will of a God, you see. And if
          our teachings can reconcile these views
          it would be doing a great service to

                         MANKIND -

                         JOHN MORE
          Do you think it can?

                         MASTER
          I not only think it can, I know it does.

                         JOHN MORE
          You mentioned 'good science' and what it
          does.. .but doesn't that, by definition,
          allow for more than one opinion?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MASTER
          Indeed, indeed. Which is why our
          gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -

                         JOHN MORE
          Otherwise you merely have the will of one
          man - which is the basis of cult, is it
          not?

                         MASTER
          T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are,
          all of us, working at break-neck speeds
          and in unison towards catching the minds
          fatal flaws and correcting it back to
          it's original state of perfect - whilst
          righting civilization.

                         JOHN MORE
          I must say that I find it quite --

                         CLARK
          I'm from there. Master and headquarters
          there for a year.

                         FREDDIE
          .how'd you see them?

                         CLARK
          I read the first book. I worked at Boeing
          for three years. When I read the book, I
          didn't want to waste my time there
          anymore. I came to help the Cause.

                         FREDDIE
          What did it say?

                         CLARK
          I'm skeptical of everything. Always have
          been. All I know is I used to not be able
          to sleep. Now I sleep through the night.
          I spent 18 months at the Presidio with
          every Army head-shrinker they had and not
          one did as much for me as Book One did.
          That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met
          Elizabeth, so...

                         FREDDIE
          That's good.

                         CLARK
          He changes things. And the research is
          hard to keep up with. None of this is
          done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy
          to get lost.

                         FREDDIE
          He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I
          don't understand myself but - more time
          with it and I might - I feel better - I
          feel like I've more to do with my life
          since I met him... and I JUST met him.
          So - that can't be a bad thing, right?

          BEAT.

                         FREDDIE
          I still don't understand what you're
          saying...

                         CLARK
          The Darkest Cloud? AKA Dual Saber? Or The
          Split Saber?

                         FREDDIE
          .no...

                         CLARK
          .it's what started all this. Back
          then...in 1941, Master...he'd been in
          operation, in army hospital. He died on
          the table...gone for seven minutes...but

                         CAME BACK:
          And in a storm of vision and creative
          output from this experience he wrote The
          Split Saber aka The Darkest Cloud.
          Whoever read it...either went insane or
          committed suicide. Twelve people read it.
          Six dead, four disappeared. The last time
          anyone saw it...was his last publisher in
          New York.

                         CLARK (CONT'D)
          Master walked into the office to find out
          what the reaction was, the publisher
          called for the reader, the reader came in
          with the manuscript... . threw It on the
          table. . .and flung himself out of the
          skyscraper window...
          Master took the book and hid it where no
          one could get to it...it's inside this
          book: all the history. All the facts. All
          too dangerous. He re-wrote it, using what
          he could as the basis for what we are
          able to accept and learn today.. .that's
          Book One that we all study and know. . .but
          the real stuff. The things at the
          center...are still too dangerous. They
          (kill/cure) any man who reads it. It's
          passing through the jaws of resistance.
          It's the truth about all this. The book
          is protected and hidden. No one knows
          where but Master.

                         FREDDIE
          The truth about all what?

                         CLARK
          Life on this planet.
          .Freddie stares at him... then takes a good long look at
          the BURLESQUE DANCER AND HER BREASTS. THEN BACK TO CLARK:

                         FREDDIE
          What is something like that worth?

                         CLARK
          He said he was once offered $25,000
          dollars for it...but the price is... . how
          could you figure out what the price is on
          something like that? Heretofore unknown.
          Incalculable by man.

                         FREDDIE
          Where is it?

                         CLARK
          It's locked away in a vault somewhere? I
          don't know.

                         FREDDIE
          Where?

                         CLARK
          No one knows for sure. Some say Phoenix
          or the desert outside Los Angeles.

          It's held back, until the time is right.
          Or in case it's needed.

                         FREDDIE
          Needed for what?

                         CLARK
          (leverage.) ? I don't know.

                         FREDDIE
          How do you know about this?

                         CLARK
          Everyone knows about it. It's the
          original text.
          FREDDIE just sort of looks, then looks back to the NAKED

          DANCER.

          ANGLE, LATER.
          The DANCER (ELLEN) has joined them . Ad-libbed

          INT. HOTEL/HALLWAY - NIGHT - LATER

          CLARK is dragging FREDDIE down the hall, passed out...he
          gets him to the room... opens the door..pulls him
          inside...

          FADE OUT.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

          .FREDDIE wakes up. Takes him a good long time.
          CAMERA just watches. He soaks everything in, thinks,
          thinks, thinks. He puts the pieces together of last night
          an the last few days.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MASTER'S HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

          START CU. ON MASTER. He looks down at something in his
          hands, quietly inspects it, looks up:
          FREDDIE is here, he's given him the HANDKERCHIEF. HOLD
          between them, then;

                         MASTER
          What is it?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't think John More will be speaking
          out against you again.

                         MASTER
          This isn't the way...you heard me say to
          attack and you attacked?

                         FREDDIE
          You were right.

                         MASTER

                         FREDDIE
          You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth.

                         MASTER
          My little Soldier.. .what did you
          do?... . you need to tell me so that I
          know...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         FREDDIE
          That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad.
          Just scared him good.

          WIDEN ANGLE, THAT MOMENT.
          Reveal MARY SUE is here, listening... Master looks to Mary
          Sue, back to Freddie:

                         MARY SUE
          Whatever you've done, best not come back
          to Master or the Cause.

                         FREDDIE
          It won't.

                         MASTER
          But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy.
          Ok? Alright. Freddie:
          You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you
          are!
          The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks
          OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE:

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          How are you...?
          How do you feel to be so close to your
          Auntie - just across the river? Close to
          the incident of this present time?

                         FREDDIE
          I don't really think about all that stuff
          with my Auntie, you know ...I got other
          things going on besides that thing I told
          you about.. .that's yesterday's news to
          me, so...

                         MASTER
          Your problems aren't with your auntie or
          your mommy or daddy or any such things.

                         FREDDIE

                         MASTER
          You have seeded aberrations in this way.
          Absolute rejection of authority and nay-
          sayers.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what
          you mean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         MASTER
          Don't act out. This anger and battle has
          been there from before you remember.
          Before you know. It's not you, Freddie.
          It's not...I promise you.
          Freddie takes it all in.

                         FREDDIE
          -- what is it?
          He grasps his shoulders, touches his head to Freddie.

                         MASTER
          It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of
          years ago - little implants..
          BEAT. He pulls back, smiles...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          I promise to explain it. And make it go
          away.
          MASTER collects his notebooks.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Val has a habit of finding trouble...
          I sometimes wonder what danger a man
          could get himself into this Island.

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Can you do this for me?
          With a casualness and delicacy? Watchful
          eyes to make sure trouble doesn't come...
          or that come doesn't trouble? My little
          soldier?

                         FREDDIE
          Keep an eye on him?

                         MASTER
          And report back to me...

                         FREDDIE
          Alright.
          MASTER leaves.

          INT. FREDDIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          FREDDIE is getting into his duffle bag, re-filling the
          booze supply... hiding the JEWELS he stole from last
          night's party...
          ELIZABETH comes to his room, from the connecting door;
          she's fresh from a bath, in a robe.

                          ELIZABETH
          Hi.

                          FREDDIE
          Hi.

                         ELIZABETH
          Why aren't you downstairs?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm working.

                         ELIZABETH
          What are you doing?

                         FREDDIE
          Errands.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're not an errand boy...you're a
          loafer... you're doing more than that, I
          can tell.
          BEAT. She steps up close to him.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I want to tell you...
          Freddie. . .what you did for my father last
          night was spectacular.

                         FREDDIE
          I didn't do anything.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm my father's daughter.
          Don't tell me you did nothing. It was
          just what was needed to be done. And you
          took it upon yourself.
          Shereaches for his face;

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I can tell that you know what persecution
          feels like...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          She KISSES him. He kisses back. Gentle and small. A
          prolonged simple kiss on the lips.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Can I have some of your liquor?

                         FREDDIE
          No.

                         ELIZABETH
          Why not?

                         FREDDIE
          It's too strong.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm a big girl.

                         FREDDIE
          Not big enough yet -

                         ELIZABETH
          I could just steal some...

                         FREDDIE
          Don't argue with me. You're Father's
          speaking .get dressed and get down
          there...

                         'ELIZABETH
          There's plenty of time... besides:
          I've heard it all before.
          She backs away.. .smiles. . .and closes the door..(JUST
          BEFORE IT SLAMS SHUT - her ROBE FALLS OFF, REVEALING HER

          NAKED FIGURE FOR A FLEETING SECOND...)
          FREDDIE. Looking at the door. FREDDIE. Hold. He takes a

          LARGE SWIG OF BOOZE.

                         CUT TO:

          INT BANQUET HALL - MOMENTS LATER
          MASTER takes the stage. THIRTY/FORTY STUDENTS applaud. He
          gets up, speaks:

                         MASTER
          THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Well? Down but not
          out. Not Dead Yet!
          (no tombstone at least...) he he he he.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          We are going to focus this morning to
          "Communication" to cover "any exchange
          between ourselves and our environment."
          Because that's what I want to talk to you
          about today: dominating your environment.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STAIRWELL. EVENING/LATER

          CAMERA looks up the spiral stairwell of the HOTEL. It's
          the end of the evening/lectures... . WE SEE: VAL walking
          down the steps ... . moments later, about three floors
          above, FREDDIE pokes his head over, sees VAL and starts
          to follow... . MUSIC STARTS.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. LOBBY OF THE HOTEL. THAT MOMENT

          VAL moves past FOLLOWERS who are wrapping up for the
          evening, discussing, smoking cigs, exchanging ideas,
          etc...and out into the NEW YORK CITY STREETS.
          FREDDIE follows ... MINI-SEQUENCE...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT./INT. COFFEE SHOP. VILLAGE. NIGHT

          VAL walks into a coffee shop, takes a seat in a booth and
          orders some coffee...
          FREDDIE stands across the street and watches VAL.
          FREDDIE buys hot dog from a hot-dog vendor... stands and
          waits.. .and watches VAL sit alone...
          After a few minutes ... FREDDIE sees something:
          A YOUNG GROUP ENTERS THE COFFEE SHOP. It's BILL WHITE,
          his girlfriend PEGGY and TWO MALE NEW YORK FOLLOWERS: JIM
          LEHR AND FRED FRITZ. They're here to meet VAL. They join
          him, sit down, speak. Order cokes, coffee, smoke cigs,
          etc...
          FREDDIE watching all this from across the street. VAL is
          answering their questions, speaking with some authority
          about something, etc. etc.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          .FREDDIE sizes up the situation

          AND PULLS HIS EAR, CATCHING FREDDIE'S EYE. As we hear the
          woman ramble on, FREDDIE gets his FLASK, moves discreetly
          to get a glass, make a drink and brings it to MASTER.
          This is unnoticed by everyone but MARY SUE. The WOMAN

                         FINISHES TALKING:

          Cheers to that!

          quickly... think of the speed at which a
          movement could grow...
          BEAT. Met with a strange silence. MARY SUE moves to get
          up. . .MASTER changes the topic slightly...

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          To live in the days of six-shooters and
          open frontier, that's what I'd like! My
          grandfather. Rancher. Wyoming. A criminal
          of the highest lineage, once told me he
          met a boy named Buckskin Joe...
          He keeps talking...

          INT. MASTER'S ROOM/HELEN'S HOUSE - MORNING

          It's the next morning. MASTER is getting ready, dressing
          in the bathroom, getting ready for his lectures... MARY
          SUE comes in, from behind him... she hugs him from
          behind.. .he smiles.. .she looks at him in the mirror, he
          looks at her ... . she REACHES AROUND, GETS INTO HIS PANTS

          AND STARTS TO JERK HIM OFF, LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM IN

          THE EYE AS SHE SAYS:

                         MARY SUE
          You can do. Whatever you want. As long as
          I don't find out. And as long. As. Anyone
          I know. Doesn't know. Other than that.
          You stop this idea. And you put it back
          in its pants. It didn't work for them.
          And it's not gonna work for you. We.
          Have. Enough problems. Cum for me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         MASTER
          Yes. Yes.

                         MARY SUE
          Do it. And get your best behavior out...
          cum for me...

                         MASTER
          Yes, master.

                         MARY SUE
          And no more of that boy's booze.

                         MASTER
          Yes master.
          He comes, collapses, sinks to the floor. She washes her
          hands and walks out of the bathroom.

          EXT. SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA/CAUSE COLLEGE - DAY

          A beautiful spring day. STUDENTS, FOLLOWERS, COME IN,

          SIGN IN...
          IN THE MAIN LIVING ROOM, on stage, MASTER is working with
          a WOMAN, processing her. She lays back on a couch set
          up...FULL CROWD of students watching...

                         MASTER
          Try to recall how you feel...

                         WOMAN
          Oh, I'm sort of glad it's the end..

                         MASTER
          What happens next?

                         WOMAN
          The doctor puts a stethoscope to her
          chest..

                         MASTER
          What is the doctor wearing?

                         WOMAN
          A white coat.

                         MASTER
          Is there a smell in the room?.

                         WOMAN
          It smells like a hospital.

                         MASTER
          Try to imagine what a hospital smells
          like.

                         WOMAN
          Uugh. Uugh. Alright.

                         MASTER
          What does the doctor say?

                         WOMAN
          He listens to her chest and says, "She's
          gone."
          FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the
          house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see
          the. STAGE IN THE B.G...
          .VAL is bored and nodding off to sleep ...FREDDIE
          watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --

                         FREDDIE
          Wake up. Your Father's speaking.. .you
          could learn something.

                         VAL
          What's that?

                         FREDDIE
          You heard me.

                         VAL
          He's making this up as he goes, don'tcha
          know..? You can sleep and wake up and not
          have missed anything...

                         FREDDIE
          Maybe you should pay more attention.

                         VAL
          You have something to say to me?

                         FREDDIE
          I'm curly-q. Round in circles. So shut
          up.
          .FREDDIE takes a nice big drink from his FLASK...
          FREDDIE looks out the open front door: TWO POLICEMAN AND
          A MARSHALL are parking their cars and walking towards the
          house...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

          FREDDIE.
          Watching them advance... He hesitates. He's not sure what
          to do. So he stays put...
          The MEN walk up to the house ...FREDDIE and VAL look:

                         POLICEMAN
          We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't know who that is...

                         POLICEMAN
          May we come in?

                         FREDDIE
          No. You cannot.

                         VAL
          Yes you can. He's up there -
          VAL points to the stage...

                         VAL (CONT'D)
          That's him.

                         FREDDIE
          You can't come in. Get outta here.
          MASTER, ON STAGE, looks out - AGAINST THE GLARE OF THE
          DOOR, he can recognize the FIGURES AS UNIFORMED...

          ANGLE, AT THE DOOR.

                         POLICEMAN
          We have a civil warrant to serve to
          Lancaster Dodd to appear in Philadelphia
          Bankruptcy Court - an arrest warrant -

                         VAL
          Stay out of their way, Freddie.
          MASTER walks down to see what's happening.

                         MASTER
          What is happening here?

                         POLICEMAN
          Are you Lancaster Dodd?

                         MASTER
          Yes I Am.

                         POLICEMAN
          We have an arrest warrant for you, sir...

                         MASTER
          What are the charges?

                         POLICEMAN

          That's.what we'll have to take you in for

                         MASTER
          This is a silly joke, no?

                         MARSHALL
          No, sir it isn't. But we have to take you
          in and book and fingerprint you.

                         MASTER
          This is comic opera. Is it illegal in
          this city to get better?

                         MARSHALL
          Please put your hands behind your back.

                         MASTER
          I have no disagreement with you boys
          doing your work in all its silliness as
          defenders of what code? What honor? What
          part of the galaxy? This is a scientific
          gathering - you will cuff me from the
          front, if you please --
          He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD

          AND START TO PROTEST ABOUT THIS. ONE YOUNG MAN, WITH ONE

          ARM AND A HOOK FOR A HAND STARTS SWINGING IT AROUND (WWII

                         VET)
          FREDDIE gets into it and is pushed by a POLICEMAN which
          unleashes a WRATH IN HIM. IT VERY QUICKLY BECOMES A MINI-

          MELE.

          FREDDIE IS SLAMMED TO THE GROUND AND WRESTLED WITH BY THE

          TWO MARSHALS. HE FIGHTS BACK. IT'S VERY ROUGH AND

          VIOLENT.
          MASTER, FREDDIE are taken away in hand cuffs. MARY SUE
          comes out, angry at the police, everyone is, etc. Quite a

          MASTER is actually trying to CALM FREDDIE DOWN, WHO IS

          GOING NUTS IN THE HANDCUFFS AND AT HIS TREATMENT

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Freddie, no, no, no, calm down, please,
          please. It's nothing, just laugh, we'll

          INT. POLICE CAR


          THEY SHOVE FREDDIE INTO THE CAR AND HE GOES CRAZY.

          SMASHING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW, THE BACK SEAT, ETC.

          HE YELLS LIKE AN ANIMAL. KICKS AND SCREAMS, BLEEDING FROM

          HIS FOREHEAD.
          MASTER is put into another car.

          INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

          They arrive in CARS. FREDDIE in one.car. MASTER in the
          other.
          FREDDIE is STILL FIGHTING. THEY DRAG HIM. MASTER is
          speaking to him, trying to calm him down...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOLDING CELL - LATER

          It's hours later. FREDDIE is out of energy. MASTER sits
          with him. Old-fashioned holding cell.
          MASTER holds his FINGER TO HIS LIPS.

                         MASTER
          Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
          He gets up close to FREDDIE, whispers in his ear;

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          Whatever we say is undoubtably being
          monitored...speak in whispers.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't want to talk to you right now.

                         MASTER
          This is FBI work, Russians
          maybe... this... too much work for the

                         MASTER
          You're fear of capture and imprisonment
          is an implant from millions of years ago.
          An Invader Force played games with your
          spirit as it.moved from one body to the
          next - free for a moment - it was free
          and the invader force captured it - spun
          you around in a device not unlike a
          grinder and hit you with waves of high
          wattage electrical impulses - quaver
          bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges
          and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped
          in scalding hot water, then freezing cold
          - a control mechanism - any legal action,
          a summons to court, the sight of a police
          officer, exposes a glandular reaction and
          anxiety wave of the highest order,

                         TRIGGERED -
          the mere threat of arrest will make a
          psychotic breakdown. This happened to you
          and you are free to stop it. Their game
          and implants are no match for you. Laugh
          in their face. Laugh at it. These
          triggers are useless now. You created
          THEM so YOU can DESTROY THEM.
          MASTER pulls away ... FREDDIE looks at him. HOLD.

                         FREDDIE
          Horseshit.

                         MASTER
          I don't have any opinions. I'm giving you
          facts.

                         FREDDIE
          Just shut-your-mouth? You're a fucking

          DRUNK.

                         MASTER
          ME shut my mouth? You're a fucking DRUNK.
          You CACTUS. Play a game with me?
          I don't think so, you little yo-yo. That
          ain't the way. You want to shut me up?
          I'm the best and only friend you have,
          shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU.
          ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You
          wanna get rid of this or live this way or
          MASTER it?

                         MASTER (CONT'D)
          You listen - you wanna spit in that cops
          face for touching you? I'm gonna beat him
          with you. Bash his skull in. BUT DON'T

          TURN ON ME, DRUNK.
          Long silence. They sit in it.

          Helen's house...all those girls walking
          around, the wives of ... . I want to fuck
          all of them.

                         MASTER
          Sex is not an aberration. Never has been.
          So what's wrong?

                         FREDDIE
          I want to fuck 'em all. I want to stick
          it in every one of them.

                         MASTER
          When did you forget that surviving was
          what you're supposed to do. Stick it in.
          Stick it in.

                         FREDDIE
          I don't belong in here, man. I gotta get
          out of here...

                         MASTER
          You belong at sea.

          .hmph...

                         MASTER
          .You belong to Doris.

                         FREDDIE
          Why're you talking about her?

                         MASTER
          You think of Doris. The loss of her.
          Triggers millions of little shocks and.
          charges, doesn't it? That present-life
          loss.

                         FREDDIE
          It was Val who let them in the house and
          told them who you were... Val did it.

          MOMENTS LATER. SAME.

          Where's he going? What's he doing?
          MASTER sits on the bed, thinks.

                         MASTER
          -- The drinking blocks the physical pain
          and dissolves treatment from working,

                         MARY SUE
          Let me be unambiguous: Tell me you won't
          drink.

          .By bringing everyone together with the
          promise of unveiling new levels ... there
          will be interest from outside

          CIA, Russians, Catholic Church. The list
          is long, Freddie.

          We don't expect trouble, but if it
          comes... we believe and trust that you are
          the right man for this mission.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're the only one that can do this,
          Freddie.

          .What is Val doing in all this?

                         MARY SUE
          He's a squirrel. And he has weaknesses.

                         NORMAN CONRAD
          Do you believe that no man can be neutral
          in the struggle between civilization and
          chaos?

                         FREDDIE
          Yes.

                         MARY SUE
          Val's not a threat to you. You can handle

          Someone's been there. I don't know when.
          I may have just missed them - the front
          door was locked, I went in with the key
          and the house up ended, all smashed up on
          the ground - I walked to the back - the
          door was open -

                         MASTER
          Possibly. A crazed lone lunatic for all
          we know. Certain atomic agencies wouldn't
          mind a crack at it, I'm sure.

          You know what this all is? Huh? It's
          mental cruelty. That's what it is. It's
          just mental cruelty to invent all these
          new ideas and never follow through on it
          and just keep adding and subtracting and
          I gotta pay for this and that level and
          more and more-and Book II's coming. All

          good 'cause here's the new thing.. .and
          oh no...you don't need that.. .that's

          a matter that only you can help me with -
          that may, in fact, cure the insane once
          and for all...
          BACK TO FREDDIE. PASSED OUT IN THE MOVIE THEATER.. .he
          wakes up, looks around... watches Casper for a second or
          two.. .gets up...
          And walks down the very steep flight of stairs on the
          balcony...

          .it's dark...he's drunk...he takes a step or two the
          wrong way - and FALLS...he not only falls down the steps -
          but OVER THE BALCONY RAILING AND DOWN INTO THE MAIN

          AUDITORIUM...
          The fall should either kill him or break his back.
          Audience members come rushing over, helping him. . .people
          call for help ...FREDDIE'S KNOCKED OUT. HOLD THIS AND

          WATCH AS PEOPLE HELP HIM. . .THERE IS WOMAN HER...SHE IS A

          FREDDIE looks around. He sees a YOUNG WOMAN...it all
          takes him a minute.. .he focuses on her:
          It's her...ELLEN.

                         ELLEN
          You're alright. You're Superman.
          He looks at her.

                         ELLEN
          Do you remember me?
          you saved my life.
          you don't remember me?
          You told me where I could get some help.
          And I did.
          And it saved my life.
          Freddie looks at her, looks around, looks down at
          himself. Only a few bandages, all seems to be in order..

                         ELLEN
          Do you know what happened?

                         FREDDIE
          I fell over the balcony.

          and what my life was life before the

          CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He
          was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one
          year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised
          sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected
          many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and
          has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His
          favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and
          Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.
          He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges
          quotes from it with his friend TONY.

          Opening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which
          CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a
          celebration...a sense of "one big unending party."
                         
          During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters
          that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL,
          TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They
          are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-
          American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from
          these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people
          to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family,
          Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during
          some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE
          participated.

          INT. BATHROOM IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR
                         
          A longhaired "freak" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the
          door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is
          totally different in appearance and dress from the "freak."
          He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts.
          His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part
          of the city and owns several night club type discotheques
          and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is
          operated by TONY - "TONY'S PLACE." CHARLIE is one of his
          closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless.
          He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine.
                         
                          TONY
           What the fuck...hey!
                         
          TONY rushes over to the "freak", who is too strung out to
          defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around.
                         
                          TONY

          are a few people in the bar...mainly neighborhood guys like

          TONY crosses over to one of the neighborhood guys by the bar
          and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat.

          The area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked
          side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to
          another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby.
          MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different
          neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as
          CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and
          dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles
          in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes
          and runs a small-time "loan shark" business. He has a knack
          for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.
                         
          Michael crosses over to a '58 black Oldsmobile.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Hey, hurry up with that shit will ya.
                         
          MICHAEL gets in the car. Another MAN is sitting in the back.
          He is also well dressed. MICHAEL takes a small lens out of
          his pocket and tosses it to the MAN.
                         
                          MAN

          A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in
          the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox,
          contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN
          CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child
          and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut
          looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled
          from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
          several months in reform school. He is reckless,
          unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-
          F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next
          door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own
          and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.
                         
          JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
          under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into
          the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little
          faster now and smiling a little more.
                         
          Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and
          blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the
          blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame:

          He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he
          starts running. WE SEE that he is grinning - quite
          literally - like crazy.

          Booth. The church is very old, quiet, and dark. The CAMERA
          ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the
          foreground. CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and
          confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN.

           of Confession. And as a penance
           they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and
           ten 'Our Fathers'...
                         
          THE CAMERA BEGINS TO TRUCK OUT. IT MOVES AROUND CHARLIE AND
          AWAY FROM THE HOLY CANDLES REVEALING CHARLIE'S PROFILE.

          his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the
          crucified body of Christ, eyes closed reclining in his
          sepluchure.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONTINUING)
           ...If I'm going to do penance at
           all, I'll do it the way I think it
           would be done...by me, that
           is...according to my own trespasses.
           You know what I mean.
                         
          This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time
          in other parts of the story as CHARLIE will periodically try
          very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his
          "God." The images accompanying these monologues are to be of
          free association almost documentary in nature.
                         
          INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
                         
          The club is dark and noisy and smokey when CHARLIE enters.
          He greets TONY who is sitting on a bar-stool. TONY directs
          CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group
          is now getting boisterously drunk.
                         
           6.
                         
                         
          CHARLIE joins in, immediately taking on the mood of the group.
                         
          The rest of the club is filled with many different types of
          customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers,
          sailors, male and female gays, and "the boys from the
          neighborhood." The music is loud and the lights are flashing
          but the strippers have not yet appeared.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          TONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the
          bouncers. He seems upset about the noise that CHARLIE and
          his friends are creating. TONY doesn't take GEORGE very
          seriously.
                         
                          GEORGE
           It's ten o'clock and they're like
           this. And they're just starting?
                         
          TONY smiles.
                         
                          GEORGE
                          (CONTINUING)
           Smile...What are you smiling at?
           This is a business night.
                         
                          TONY
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           George...did I ever tell you the
           story about the three chickens?
                         
                          GEORGE
                          (GENUINELY)
           No...
                         
                          TONY
           Too bad.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There
          is no particular logical sequence except that events are
          suited to the rythmic pattern of the music.
                         
          1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the
           music.
                         
          2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a
           filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the
           bar. He fails.
                         
          3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's
           table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also
           fails.
                         
           7.
                         
                         
          4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the
           puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the
           darkness.
                         
          5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes
           obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to
           her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half
           amusedly to ignore him but she can't.
                         
          6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a
           chaser swigs down Aqua Velva.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          CHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE, the
          stripper, perform again. He stares glassy-eyed and then
          begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Y'know...she's really good-looking...
           really good-looking. I've gotta
           say that again. She's really good-
           looking...but she's black... You
           can see that real plain.
           (as an afterthought)
           When you get down to it though...
           there's not much of a difference,
           is there?
           (He waits for an answer)
           Well...is there?
           (He smiles and begins
           chewing on an ice
           cube from his half
                          EMPTY GLASS)
                         
                         
          Suddenly MICHAEL appears and sits down at CHARLIE's table.
          He hands CHARLIE two cartons of cigarettes.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Oh great...hey - Winstons?
                         
                          MICHAEL
           For these prices don't be particular.
           That's all they had - but next week
           we'll see...
                         
          CHARLIE gives him the money.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           OK, ok...
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
                         
           8.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No...I'll be ok for a week.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (DISINTERESTED)
           Nope...
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Isn't he supposed to be here
           tonight...I mean...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Look...I don't know. What am I
           supposed to be, his keeper or
           something? Yeah, he's supposed to
           be here but who knows what goes on
           in his head. Right?
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I'd like to know Charlie, it looks
           like your little friend is trying
           to duck me...
                         
          CHARLIE remains silent.
                         
                          MICHAEL
                          (CONTINUING)
           ...Charlie, don't you think you
           should be interested in Johnny's
           payments to me? I think you should
           be, you know that.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (QUIETLY)
           Michael, nobody's out to screw you,
           I guarrantee that.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I know that Charlie but look at my
           side. You undersigned the loans.
           You vouched for him. What happens
           if this kid don't pay me? I gotta
           collect from you? I don't want to
           do that. I made a deal with him
           not you, right?
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (PATRONIZING)
           You're right. You're right. Look,
           I'm not gonna wind up paying his
           debts. You know that.
                         
           9.
                         
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I don't know that. That's what I'm
           telling you.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Michael, believe me. You know the
           kid's a little crazy sometimes. I
           vouched for him and he'll come
           through. I promise. I'll talk to
           him and straighten him out. Don't
           worry, OK?
                         
                          MICHAEL
                          (SATISFIED)
           OK.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          JOHNNY BOY enters the night club with two friends. He has
          been drinking. JOHNNY BOY'S face shows fresh cuts and
          bruises. His friends approach the hat check girl and give
          her their coats. JOHNNY BOY approaches her giving her his
          pants instead. His friends laugh hysterically.
                         
          CHARLIE is now alone at the end of the bar. JOHNNY BOY now
          completely dressed enters the bar area. CHARLIE watches
          JOHNNY BOY approaching and continues his Confession. JOHNNY
          BOY greets people as he passes them, and as CHARLIE speaks,
          he appears to be moving in slow motion.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           What do you think? 'If a man have
           a hundred sheep, and one of them
           stray, will he not leave the
           ninety-nine in the mountains, and
           go in search of the one that has
           strayed? And if he happen to find
           it, amen I say to you, he rejoices
           over it more than over the ninety-
           nine that did not go astray. Even
           so, it is not the will of your
           Father in Heaven that a single one
           of these little ones should
           perish.'... Ok that's very nce but...
                         
          TONY is now behind the bar near CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY has
          reached them.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Drinks for everybody Tony...
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           Giovanino! Where have you been?

           and a double for you and Charlie
           here.
           (quietly to TONY)
           And put it on my tab, willya?
                         
                          TONY
           Which one, the big tab or the
           little tab?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Put it on the little tab so that it
           balances with the big one.
                         
                          TONY
                          (SARCASTICALLY)
           Yeah, so things'll be even.
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY grimace. MICHAEL appears.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           How about me? I don't get a drink
           John?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (FEIGNING SURPRISE)
           Of course! A double for Michael,
           Tony.
                         
          TONY mumbles.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY interrupts MICHAEL who is about to speak.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (CONTINUING)
           I know what you're going to say but
           don't say it. These drinks are all
           on the tab. I'm gonna see you this
           Tuesday payday, I promise. I give
           you my word.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You what?
                         
          The drinks arrive. They all smile and salute each other
          with their drinks.

          EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is walking along the street. It is rush hour and
          the traffic is heavy. A shiny, late model car stops parallel
          to JOHNNY BOY. The young boy (SAL) signals him by blowing
          the horn. (Note that in the FLASHBACK, JOHNNY BOY'S face is
          not bruised.)
                         
                          SAL
           Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Sal!... fourteen street.
                         
                          SAL
           Come on.
                         
          INT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           This is some boat. Your father's?
                         
                          SAL
           Yeah...just had it delivered...
                         
           12.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Hey... you got stereo.
                         
                          SAL
           Yeah, I think so.
                         
          As JOHNNY BOY admires the gadgets in the car he notices that
          SAL is becoming very nervous.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           You got a speaker back there?
                         
          He turns to look for the speaker and sees a police car not
          far behind.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (CONTINUING)
           Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab
           behind us.
                         
                          SAL
                          (NERVOUSLY)
           I know...I know.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           What'sa matter...forget your
           registration?
                         
                          SAL
           No...no. Nooo...it's just that
           I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Yeah, it's your father's.
                         
                          SAL
           Well...no.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           You mean it's heisted.
                         
                          SAL
           You could say that.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           (announcing it loudly)
           This is a heisted car!
                         
          SAL smiles sheepishly. JOHNNY BOY panics.
                         
          EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The police switch on their flashing red light and try to get
          closer to them but the traffic is too heavy.
                         
           13.
                         
                         
          SAL manages to turn the next corner at about twenty miles
          per hour.
                         
          INT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          JOHNNY BOY frightened now, underestimates the speed of the
          car and quickly opens the door.
                         
          EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          JOHNNY BOY tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp-
          post. He has seriously banged his head and blood is running
          down his face. But because of the near proximity of the
          police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of
          dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street.
                         
                         END FLASHBACK
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
                         
          TONY has now joined the group sitting at the table...
          CHARLIE and TONY nod in disbelief.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           It's the truth, I swear.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           All right, forget it. Tony, you
           got anything we can put on his face?
                         
                          TONY
           Yeah, in the back.
                         
          They all get up.
                         
                          TONY
                          (CONTINUING)
           C'mon, I got something to show you
           anyway.
                         
          INT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK HALL - NIGHT
                         
          They push their way through the crowd and enter a narrow
          dimly lit hallway on both sides.
                         
          INT. BACK ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
                         
          A boy and girl are necking on a make-shift couch in the
          darkened room.
                         
           14.
                         
                         
                          GIRL
                          (WHISPERING)
           Jimmy, I tell you there's something
           in this room.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (MURMURS)
           Ahhh come on baby...willya'...cut
           it out.
                         
          Suddenly the light is turned on. TONY, CHARLIE, and JOHNNY
          BOY enter the room. The GIRL is startled and jumps up.
          JIMMY appears bewildered.
                         
                          TONY
           Excuse us Jimmy, we'll only be a
           moment.
                         
                          TONY
           S'alright Tony.
                         
          The GIRL and JIMMY sit self-consciously as TONY goes to the
          medicine cabinet, takes out a few items and gives them to
          CHARLIE. TONY then crosses to the other side of the room
          where he removes the blanket which has been covering a large
          cage. He reveals a live, young beautiful PANTHER stalking
          to and fro.
                         
          The GIRL screams.
                         
                          GIRL
           I told you there was something in
           this room.
                         
          The GIRL runs out.
                         
          Everyone else except TONY, is backed up against the wall,
          frightened. The BOYS laugh nervously.
                         
                          TONY
           Keep quiet about this. I don't
           have any license for him yet. I've
           only had him a couple of days.
           Nobody can feed him except me. I'm
           the only one he trusts. Watch.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't go to any trouble. We
           believe you... We believe you.
                         
          TONY begins to open the cage. The BOYS are now standing on
          top of the nearest pieces of furniture.
                         
           15.
                         
                         
                          TONY
                          (ENTERING CAGE)
           Really wanted to get a little tiger
           Charlie, y'know...a little William
           Blake and all that...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Be careful.
                         
          TONY ignores CHARLIE's warning as he crouches and allows the
          animal to wander onto his lap where upon he strokes the
          panther gently murmuring to him.
                         
          The BOYS watch in silence.
                         
          INT. TONY'S PLACE - CORNER TABLE - NIGHT
                         
          The Italian song "Malafemina" (a tango-like rythmn) is heard
          coming from the juke-box. It is near closing time and there
          are only a few customers left in the club, including MICHAEL
          and two gays, BENTON and SAMMY, who is getting very drunk.
                         
          CHARLIE is at the corner table with TONY and JOHNNY BOY.
          CHARLIE is washing JOHNNY BOY'S face with cold water from a
          basin. Some of JOHNNY'S blood has mingled with the water.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean
           you've had the place for over a
           year now. Nothing different...same
           old place...ordinary...flat...no
           imagination.
                         
          TONY ignores CHARLIE's half-joking, drunken remarks.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONTINUES)
           For instance, the difference
           between me and you is this...you
           take that panther back there. I'd
           put him right up here above the
           bar...nice cage, you know? Nothing
           ordinary in my place. What good is
           it? You get robot customers. They
           come in, drink beer, go to the
           bathroom, and go home. No sir.
                         
          One of the BOYS more casual acquaintances is lying on the
          bar, drunk. He begins to sing along with the Italian
          music - but very badly.
                         
           16.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           See what I mean?
                          (PAUSE)
           A question please...'Is this what
           you call living?'
                         
                          TONY
                          (WEARILY)
           'Take a little tip from Mack the
           Knife...'
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (INTERRUPTS)
           Tony, break down and open another
           bottle willya'?
                         
          A well dressed young boy enters the club. GEORGE, the
          bouncer, approaches him.
                         
                          GEORGE
           We're closed.
                         
                          BOY
           I'm just waiting for Joey.
                         
          The BOY walks over to a bar stool and sits down. Nobody
          acknowledges his presence.
                         
          Suddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up,
          dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to
          look up at him. The DRUNK stares ahead for a minute.
                         
                          DRUNK
                          (MUTTERS)
           I...I gotta go to the bathroom.
                         
          EVERYONE laughs.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Well, go ahead, whaddaya want?
           Someone to hold it for you?
                         
          More laughter. Even the BOY at the bar laughs. The DRUNK
          rises, still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room.
                         
          The Big Bopper - "Chantilly Lace" in playing on the
          soundtrack. CHARLIE is playing with a deck of cards.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (continuing previous conversation)
           This place is dead. If I had a
           place...every night...lively.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation.
                         
           17.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONTINUING)
           And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE
           or CHARLIE'S PLACE...
                          (MORE CONFIDENTIALLY)
           I'd call it something like SEASON
           OF THE WITCH... get it?
                         
                          TONY
                          (QUIETLY)
           You are with out a doubt the
           biggest, most pretentious bullshit
           thrower I know. Like to see what
           kind of business you'd do.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Look who's talking. Pretentious
           bullshit. Who's the guy with
           William Blake and the tigers, eh?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Will you guys shut up with the
           witches and tigers. Tony, you
           gonna close the place, we get out
           of here, get something to eat, or
           what?
                         
                          TONY
           We'll close up as soon as everybody
           leaves.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't forget what's-his-name there
           in the bathroom.
                         
          EVERYONE laughs. JIMMY is drawing on a table top. CHARLIE
          wanders over.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Wanna see your picture?
                         
          CHARLIE leans over. OVERHEAD VIEW shows large crude swastika.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Waddaya think?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Not quite...but keep trying.
                         
          CHARLIE picks up the cards again.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Let's have a game after we close.
                         
           18.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Nah.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
                         
                          TONY
           No.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (ADDRESSING THE
                          ENTIRE BAR)
           Anybody wanna have a game?
                         
          The people in the bar do not respond. CHARLIE shrugs. The
          BOY casually leaves the bar and walks to the men's room.
                         
          INT. MENS ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
                         
          The BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK
          leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his
          pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back.
          To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall
          dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat.
          They struggle in the open doorway.
                         
          INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT
                         
          The Italian music is still playing. Everyone in the bar has
          frozen in position as they watch the scene.
                         
          In his astonishment CHARLIE allows the cards to fall from
          his hands.
                         
          The YOUNG BOY breaks away from the DRUNK and runs towards
          the exit.
                         
          The DRUNK, running only on sheet determination, stumbles
          along after the boy.
                         
          The people in the bar, including CHARLIE, dash behind tables
          and jump behind the bar for cover.
                         
          INT. TONY'S PLACE - STAIRWAY EXIT
                         
          The BOY reaches the exit and fires at the DRUNK from the top
          of the stairs. The DRUNK still follows.
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE
                         
          The BOY runs down the street and disappears into the darkness.
          The DRUNK staggers out into hte cobblestone street. His
          mind is gone, it is now just a physical matter of the body
          being stopped by the presence of a stationary object.
                         
           19.
                         
                         
          He staggers straight across the street at tremendous speed
          smashing directly into a parked car.
                         
          EXT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE
                         
          Everyone (including the two GAYS at the bar) is running out
          the back way.
                         
                          TONY
           Don't run...don't run. Everyone
           split up.
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE
                         
          MICHAEL and JIMMY turn the corner and calmly walk to his
          parked car. As they get into the car CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY
          turn the corner.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Michael, give us a lift.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           OK, get in.
                         
          As they are getting into the car the two GAYS turn the
          corner. One of them, SAMMY, is very drunk and is crying
          hysterically. His companion BENTON is trying to calm him
          down when he notices MICHAEL.
                         
                          BENTON
           Michael...wait.
                         
          It is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he
          is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly
          ushers them into the car.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Get in, get in.
                         
          INT. MICHAEL'S CAR - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are in the back seat. SAMMY crawls
          over CHARLIE into the back seat making apologies. BENTON is
          forced into the front seat with MICHAEL and JIMMY. They
          drive off, with SAMMY crying.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Oh Jesus Christ...what's this.
                         
                          BENTON
           Sammy get control of yourself.
                         
           20.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Yes, you're gettin' it all over my
           tie.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Should I slap him?
                         
                          SAMMY
           (suddenly in control)
           You wouldn't dare.
                         
                          BENTON
           I'm terribly sorry guys...It's just
           that he was terribly frightened.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Just keep him quiet.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Friends of yours Michael.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Shut up.
                         
                          BENTON
           (sensing the hostility)
           Oh...ah...I'm Benton and this is
           Sammy.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I can't get over the way he just
           kept going at him.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Must have been all the liquor in him.
                         
                          MICHAEL
                          (IN ITALIAN)
           Quiet please.
                         
          He returns to English.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Where should I drop you Charlie?
                         
                          SAMMY
           (interrupting the conversation)
           Yes Charlie, your place or mine.
                         
                          BENTON
           Sammy.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Away from the neighborhood.
                         
           21.
                         
                         
                          SAMMY
           Oh Benton...look!
                         
          SAMMY leans over JOHNNY and CHARLIE to see out the window.
          He begins to shout at a young boy on the street.
                         
                          SAMMY
                          (CONTINUING)
           Hi beautiful!!! I love you.
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY hide their faces.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Hey, shut up.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Get him in.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           What...are you kidding.
                         
                          BENTON
           Sammy, get in here this minute.
                         
                          SAMMY
           I won't...I won't! They're all
           beautiful.
                          (SHOUTING)
           I'll suck them all...I'll suck them
           all!
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY groan. They are still hiding their
          faces.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Disgraceful.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Ok...that's it.
                         
          He pulls the car over to the nearest corner.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Out!!!!
                         
                          CHARLIE
           C'mon Johnny.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You getting out too?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Yeah, thanks, it's ok.

          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY get out of the car first so that by
          the time BENTON and SAMMY are out they are already on their
          way down the street. MICHAEL drives away.
                         
                          SAMMY
                          (SHOUTING)
           Going our way?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (to JOHNNY BOY)
           Don't answer.
                         
          BENTON guides SAMMY the opposite way.
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAWN
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are walking down the street on their
          way home.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I don't think I should go home
           looking like this. You think I
           could stay at your place tonight?
           Your mother's not there is she?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No, she isn't.

          INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment.
          Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is
          furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on
          the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is
          evident that this is a family apartment rather than a
          bachelors pad.
                         
          CHARLIE is helping his mother pack a suitcase. Through out
          the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on
          CAMERA. The CAMERA PANS following his movements and CHARLIE
          directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond
          it.

           Listen, I'll be ok...it's the best
           thing. You're not going to be able
           to take care of Grandma out here
           and still get to work, you know
           that...
                          (PAUSE)
           Yes the place will be here, I'll
           take care of it.
                          (PAUSE)
           Yeah don't worry about me, I'll
           take care of myself.

          He moves into the bedroom taking more items out of the
          drawers. The room is ver small. The paint if peeling.
          Over the double bed there is a large crucifix.

           I'll eat.

          INT. CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are lying on CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S bed
          in their underwear.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You'd better make a move kid. He
           thinks you're trying to screw him.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Wouldn't bother me.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Yeah, big man...get yourself in
           more trouble. You make a fool out
           of him, you're doing the same to me.
           I signed for you don't forget.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Don't worry. I can handle it.
                         
           24.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You couldn't handle shit. You just
           better come through with some kind
           of payment on Tuesday...anything.
           Understand? Hold onto your pay-
           check this week.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (LAUGHS)
           There won't be any this week.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           What do you mean?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Didn't show up.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You sick or what? You forget what
           we had to do to get you on the
           trucks, stupid?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I don't like loading crates.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You're not supposed to like it.
           What gets me is your attitude.
           Listen... tomorrow you show up.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           What about your attitude...Where's
           your job...eh? You talk and talk
           and I go to work...what do you do?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I'll tell you what I don't do... I
           don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus
           interest, stupid. Show up or I
           break both your arms, we understand
           each other?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show.
           Tuesday I'll give Michael something.
           I promise.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't promise...just deliver.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Ok, now that that's over with...what
           are you gonna make me for breakfast?
                         
           25.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll
           break your arms right now.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           (rising from bed)
           Listen...I'm a guest here.
                         
          CHARLIE reaches out to grab him.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           OK...ok...I'm going.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT
                         
          JOHNNY is raiding the icebox.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Hey...you got nothing here.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (from the other room)
           I could have told you that.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           We'll get some food from my aunt's.
           I'll get in through the fire escape.
           She's always got something.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY leaves the kitchen and walks towards the bedroom.
                         
          INT. CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't do that. You'll scare Teresa
           if you try to sneak in.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is now by the window looking out at the fire
          escape mischieviously.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Yeah...you're right. Maybe she'll
           have a seizure and we can watch.
                         
          He laughs. CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           That's not funny. You gonna be a
           jerk-off all your life. Grow up.
           You want something to eat from your
           aunt's house you go knock on her
           door, understand?
                         
           26.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going
           to bed.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY gets into bed. CHARLIE goes into the kitchen to
          get a glass of milk.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - DAYBREAK
                         
          CHARLIE takes a glass of milk from the icebox. He listens
          to the sounds of the neighborhood waking up and getting
          ready to go to work. He leaves the kitchen.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAYBREAK
                         
          CHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be
          asleep. CHARLIE goes to the window and peers through the
          blinds. He sees in the window across the fire escape.
                         
          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various
          stages of getting dressed.
                         
          TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and
          intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she
          makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically
          supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented
          her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious
          relationships with men. She has however, been having an
          affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept
          secret from both families because the families regard each
          other as blood relations.
                         
          CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has
          begun to dial the telephone.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           (pretending to be angry)
           Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I
           want to report a disturbance. Yeah
           this man and woman next door are
           disturbing the peace. They're
           keeping me awake all night now.
           What the hell is this. What?
           Well... yelling, fighting, throwing
           things. Uh-huh. If they don't
           kill each other soon I'm goin' over
           there and do the job myself. Yes -
           the address is 270 Mott street. I
           think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah,
           right... thanks. Look, I demand
           immediate action. Never mind my
           name I don't like getting involved
           in things like this.
                         
           27.
                         
                         
          He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed.
          CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this
          was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at
          TERESA but she is no longer in her room.
                         
          INT. TERESA'S BEDROOM
                         
          CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both
          nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and
          ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate
          sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on
          the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out
          in pain.
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - MID-DAY
                         
          CHARLIE and TERESA are in the hotel room making love. The
          sounds of traffic can be heard from the street below.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          They are getting dressed.
                         
                          TERESA
           I'd like to eat something before I
           go back to work.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Ok, we'll go for lunch.
                         
                          TERESA
           Do you have enough?
                         
          CHARLIE checks his wallet.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Well...with the hotel that's ten...
           fifteen...
                         
                          TERESA
           Here.
                         
          She hands him a few bills. He hesitates.
                         
                          TERESA
           Please take it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Well...
                         
                          TERESA
           I don't mind.
                         
          She puts the money into his hand.
                         
           28.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Sure...it's not that...I mean...
                         
                          TERESA
           (touching his face)
           It's all right.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Well, if things go the way I hope
           they'll go, this money business
           will take care of itself.
                          (ASIDE)
           God willing.
                         
                          TERESA
           An apartment uptown? Downtown?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Maybe, who knows.
                         
                          TERESA
                          (SEARCHINGLY)
           Charlie...?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Nobody knows anything, believe me.
                         
          She kisses him gently.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          TERESA is putting on her stockings. A few minutes have
          passed.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           See if you can get your hands on
           some pamphlets on laws or by
           laws...or proprietorship...you
           know...at your place.
                         
                          TERESA
           Anything specific?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You know...like restaurants, night
           clubs...
                         
                          TERESA
                          (AFFECTIONATELY)
           What is it now?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't ask.
                         
           29.
                         
                         
          He gives her a quick kiss on the tip of her nose.
                         
                          TERESA
           Alright... Hey, did you hear any
           more about what happened last night?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Did you?
                         
                          TERESA
           No.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           CHRIST, you should have seen it.
           Unbelievable. The kid would turn
           around and fire and he would just
           keep coming at him like Rasputin.
           That kid was scared. Not half as
           much as we were though.
                         
                          TERESA
           It doesn't make any sense. He
           wouldn't shoot him just because he
           insulted a racket guy...not unless
           it was personal.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You missed the point. The kid's a
           climber...not very bright...but if
           you get down to his level to look
           at it his way; he kills a guy who
           insulted a big man - he gets a
           reputation. He thinks he's in good
           standing.
                         
                          TERESA
           It's still sick.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Not sick...just stupid. Speaking
           of stupid, your cousin last night
           was feeling so good he decided to
           break into your mother's house...to
           get some food.
                         
          TERESA laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly.
                         
                          TERESA
           You're sure he doesn't know.
                         
          He takes her in his arms.
                         
                          CHARLIE

          INT. HOTEL - BATHROOM - MID-DAY
                         
          CHARLIE enters the bathroom to clean-up. He stares at his
          image in the mirror for a moment, then makes a face. He
          checks the whiteness of his teeth, pulls back his hair, and
          checks his complexion. The mirror image begins to speak.
          The CAMERA PANS BACK to CHARLIE'S FACE. His mouth is not
          moving.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONFESSION)
           Don't look at me like that, I can
           see this is not going to get us
           anywhere. She's a good kid, what
           am I supposed to do. In a way I'm
           doing her a favor...no??? How many
           guys you know feel this way about
           an epileptic? Don't get me wrong,
           I'm no saint...not yet.
                         
          The image of CHARLIE in the bathroom intercuts with stills
          from Catholic School text books - vulgar color illustrations
          of parables - emphasis on Christ expelling the devils from
          the posessed women.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONTINUING)
           But I'm not like the Pharisee who
           said "Oh God I thank thee that I am
           not like the rest of them."...no...I
           like to think of myself as the
           Publican...
                         
          He strikes his breast penitently as he delivers the next line.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           ...'Oh God be merciful to me the
           sinner!' I'm not taking advantage
           of her. I swear to you that if she
           meets someone she'd like to marry...

          INT. RESTAURANT - MID-DAY
                         
          CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant.
          This restaurant was considered an above average business
          with quality and prices to match when it was first opened
          three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices
          remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE
          is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up
          a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.
          He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She
          apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on
          the table. He takes a menu.
                         
          A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He
          is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his
          shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are
          smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.
                         
                          OSCAR
           (with a slight Jewish accent)
           Hey...you're here. They told me
           you're here...and you're here. How
           are you?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Ok, how's everything going?
                         
          OSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE.
                         
           32.
                         
                         
                          OSCAR
           Don't ask...do you have any idea
           what I've been doing all
           morning...eh?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No.
                         
                          OSCAR
           I was in the basement fixing the
           pipes. Would you believe that?
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (LAUGHING)
           What pipes?
                         
                          OSCAR
                          (MIMICKING)
           What pipes...the ones from last
           year...those pipes.
                         
          CHARLIE shakes his head in sympathy.
                         
                          OSCAR
           Look Charlie, you're a good boy.
           Will you just tell your uncle that
           I have nothing. There is nothing
           to give him. No envelopes with
           cash inside, no checks, nothing.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           That bad, huh?
                         
                          OSCAR
           I can't make this week's payment
           and if this keeps up not next
           week's either.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Not next week's either...listen...you
           tell that to Giovanni, not me.
                         
                          OSCAR
           Listen, I should wrap up this place
           in a ribbon and hand it to him, you
           know that. I don't need this
           aggravation. I'm getting old.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           He'd rather have the loan payed,
           you know that.
                         
           33.
                         
                         
                          OSCAR
           Your Uncle's a good man...I won't
           stick him. Either he gets the
           money or the place and right now
           he's getting the place. And tell
           me why should I care? I got a
           partner who's a bum, who doesn't
           help out...who disappears and
           leaves me with all the problems. I
           should go back to Florida...I don't
           need this.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I don't understand, where's Groppi?
                         
                          OSCAR
           I should know? His wife don't even
           know. Probably off with one of his
           little girls...I don't know. I
           tell you, if he don't give a damn,
           then I don't give a damn...Why
           should I kill myself?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           My uncle figured that this week was
           bad...but about next week...I dunno.
           Maybe you should speak to him
           yourself.
                         
                          OSCAR
           What can I say?
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE is walking down the street on the lower east side.
          A noisy religious street festival is being held on the block.
                         
          INT. SMALL ITALIAN CAFE - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to
          some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the
          room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy
          store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle
          GIOVANNI and his associates.
                         
          GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and
          powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a
          head figure not by being introduced formally as was the
          custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the
          organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype
          of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.
                         
          GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.
                         
           34.
                         
                         
          A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in
          the corner of the room in the luncheonette area.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (to repair man)
           Is my uncle back there?
                         
          CHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway.
                         
                          REPAIR MAN
           Yeah, but I think he's busy now.
           Hey Charlie play 463 today - for
           sure.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Thanks!
                         
          CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining
          room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at
          the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.
                         
          MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest
          associate, brought into the organization in the traditional
          manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).
          He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
          GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.
                         
          MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are
          deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by
          unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.
                         
          CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He
          shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the
          conversation.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          GIOVANNI and MARIO are calmly sipping their coffee as they
          listen to the old man's nervous talk.
                         
                          OLD MAN
           (in Italian with
                          ENGLISH TITLES)
           What I'm telling you is that he did
           it for Mario's honor.
                         
                          MARIO
           But you don't understand. I knew
           the kid. He was drunk. He made of
           fool of himself...not me.
                         
           35.
                         
                         
                          OLD MAN
           (in Italian with
                          ENGLISH TITLES)
           Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an
           insult to you.
                         
                          MARIO
           There was no insult.
                         
                          OLD MAN
           (in Italian with
                          ENGLISH TITLES)
           The boy only did what was right.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Your son only did what was stupid.
           We have enough down here without
           something like that. And what for?
           ...Nothing...no reason. Protect
           him? Why? I didn't tell him to do
           anything for me. He's going to
           Miami? Good...keep him in Miami
           for six months...a year...a good
           long time. After everything's
           forgotten then I see what I can do
           for him. Right now...keep him away.
                         
          INT. LUNCHEONETTE AREA - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE is seated at a table. The waitress, MARIE,
          approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... The following
          scene is reminiscent of a TELEVISION COMMERCIAL.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Marie, are there Columbian coffee
           beans in this coffee?
                         
                          MARIE
           I dunno.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Just a second. Let me taste it.
                         
          He pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Yes, I'd say there are some
           Columbian coffee beans in this
           coffee, but only about 39%.
                         
          MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.
                         
           36.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You see. You probably don't notice
           this Marie, but Colombian coffee
           beans are rich coffee beans.
           Bursting with that good, deep
           coffee flavor. Picked when they
           are ripe to the point of perfection.
           The beans of course, are protected
           by the tall South American Guama
           trees.
                         
          MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table.
          CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back
          into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP
          DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.

           Then the bean pickers come down and
           pick each bean by hand. Bean by
           bean, all heavy with flavor. And
           they load them into boxes, one box
           at a time, box by box.
                         
          From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who
          is busy with her work.
                         
          BLACK & WHITE & COLOR
                         
          The images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS
          aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS:
          stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise
          vision of the neighborhood. All this is intercut with
          CHARLIE mentally stripping MARIE's clothes off with his eyes.
                         
                          CHARLIE

           Like, looking at my uncle back
           there. One way is the obvious;
           ...man outside the law. On the
           other hand, instead of a breakdown
           of order there is a creation of
           order and instead of the breakdown
           of law, there is the creation of
           law...In this society which needs
           new law because 'What's a crowbar
           compared to a share of stock.
           What's the robbing of a bank
           compared to the founding of one and
           what's the murder of a man to the
           gainful employment of that man.'
           'Do not think that I have come to
           destroy the Law or the Prophets. I
           have not come to destroy but to
           fulfill.' ...Amen.

          The image culminate in aerial shots of downtown New York
          City. (STOCK FOOTAGE)
                         
          CHARLIE now sees MARIE totally naked as she serves the
          customers.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          GIOVANNI and CHARLIE are standing and talking.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Uncle, how are you feeling?
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Fine. Did you have a good time
           last night?
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (QUIETLY)
           About that shooting last night...I
           was there and...
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           No you weren't.
                         
          CHARLIE is struck silent for a moment. He listens.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           You're right uncle. I must have
           gotten it confused with something
           else.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Yes, you did.

          CHARLIE and GIOVANNI are now sitting at a table.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           About Oscar...I think he put on
           this act...about the restaurant
           being in bad shape and all that.
           He can't make the payments...I
           don't know what to make of it. He
           says Groppi's run off with a girl.
           I could help if you want.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           No...his business is bad. But I'll
           decide what to do and you...and you
           just keep out of anything that
           might...might...er draw attention
           to you.

           Yes...I understand...I'll be careful.
                         
          EXT. BEACH - HAMPTONS - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE and TERESA are sitting on the beach which is fairly
          deserted. There are rented cottages behind them. TERESA
          has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to
          write a term paper for CHARLIE'S English class.
                         
                          TERESA
           C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll
           call in sick for work.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No...we can come back in a couple
           of weeks. Besides, if we're both
           gone for three days it wouldn't
           look right.
                         
                          TERESA
           Ok.
                         
          CHARLIE picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady
          and tries to read it. He tosses it aside.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Bore.
                         
                          TERESA
           A paper on that one too?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Yeah...but don't worry about that
           now. The Hemmingway one is first.
                         
                          TERESA
           It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Take your time. I don't care.
                         
                          TERESA
           I know you don't. You've been very
           preoccupied lately.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           That's the word...preoccupied.
                         
          CHARLIE turns towards TERESA and tries to kiss her. She
          playfully turns away. But CHARLIE quickly gets bored with
          that and doesn't pursue her. She is confused by his actions.

           Let's go back inside.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          CHARLIE and TERESA already farther up the beach, walking.
          They notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in
          front of it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           See that...know who lives there?
           The name George Earhardt mean
           anything to you?
                         
                          TERESA
           Sure...He lives there?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No. Of course he lives there.
           Would I point it out to you if he
           didn't?
                         
          The house is seen from a great distance. CHARLIE'S VIEWPOINT.
          There is great activity...all with a very businesslike air.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           That W.A.S.P. bastard.
                         
                          TERESA
           You're intolerable today.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Watch your language.
                         
          They arrive at the cottage.
                         
          INT. HAMPTONS COTTAGE - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE and TERESA are coming in, putting down the books and
          papers.
                         
                          TERESA
           I like it here...alone.
                         
          She caresses CHARLIE. He is still preoccupied.
                         
                          TERESA
           I'm going to take that apartment
           uptown.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why
           don't you do it this time?
                         
           40.
                         
                         
                          TERESA
           You know why...with my parents.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Well you can't blame them in a way.
                         
                          TERESA
           (pulling away from him)
           I can take care of myself. You
           know that.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I know...I know.
                         
          They embrace.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
                         
          CHARLIE'S father is the patient in the bed. The visitors
          surrounding the bed are CHARLIE'S mother, TERESA, and
          TERESA'S mother. The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS WE HEAR the
          sounds of mechanical voices coming from the T.V. sets in the
          lobby.
                         
          TERESA'S mother leans over and whispers into CHARLIE'S
          father's ear.
                         
                          TERESA'S MOTHER
           Turridu...that's your boy Charles.
           Don't you know him. Isn't that
           Charles?
                         
          There is no answer. CHARLIE is embarrassed. TERESA'S
          MOTHER asks again.
                         
                          TERESA'S MOTHER
                          (CONTINUED)
           Who is that?
                         
                          CHARLIE'S FATHER
           Che Guevara.
                         
          CHARLIE doesn't know how to react. TERESA'S MOTHER looks up
          with a half smile in disbelief. The other Visitors give off
          a small ripple of nervous laughter, repeating it...in
          whispers.
                         
          CHARLIE looks about nervously. Through the door of the
          hospital room can be seen several of the older patients
          gathered around a T.V. in the hallway. They are watching
          the races, the announcer's voice is blaring almost
          incomprehensibly.

                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          CHARLIE is getting dressed. TERESA is wrapped warmly in the
          sheets - still in bed.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           ...He must have heard the name from
           those T.V.'s in the hall that were
           blaring all the time. I remember
           GUEVARA was in town at the time.
           Must've heard it from there I
           guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
                         
                          TERESA
           Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Of all people. Now say the truth.
           Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.
                         
          They laugh. He crosses to TERESA and they kiss.
                         
                          TERESA
           I'm sleepy.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You've been running round too much.
           Bet you've been forgetting your
           medicine.
                         
                          TERESA
           The green capsules in the top drawer.
                         
          CHARLIE gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for
          a walk.
                         
          EXT. ROADWAY - HAMPTONS - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE is walking along the roadway and looking at the
          different cottages. He is carrying a notebook to which he
          periodically refers. He stops in front of a luxurious
          cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one
          in his notebook beside which is listed the name GROPPI. He
          remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring
          at it. It looks deserted.

          EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and
          rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately
          which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S
          back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We
          can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened
          door.
                         
                          GROPPI
           What do you want kid?
                         
          At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears
          in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more.
                         
                          GROPPI
           What do you want?.......well?

           We don't want no fuckin' books!
                         
          GROPPI slams the door in CHARLIE'S face.

          EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE is still standing in front of the cottage. Suddenly
          a little boy of about nine appears.
                         
                          BOY
           There's nobody here mister.
                         
          CHARLIE turns in surprise.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
                         
                          BOY
           Yeah. But he ain't here now.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Know where he is?
                         
                          BOY
           Follow me.
                         
          The BOY leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area.
                         
           43.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           How much farther?
                         
          CHARLIE repeats this question periodically as he follows the
          BOY. Finally CHARLIE finds himself alone in the middle of a
          dense forest with the BOY nowhere in sight. He calls out
          but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONFESSION)
           Now, don't get excited.
                         
          CHARLIE is trying to find his way out of the forest.
                         
                          CHARLIE

          INT. ITALIAN CAFE - DAY
                         
          A loud brass band is playing "Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, How You
          Can Love" inside the cafe. They are part of a religious
          festival and GIOVANNI has invited them in for drinks. In
          return they are playing for him. GIOVANNI has been drinking.
          The song ends.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Play it again!!!
                         
          Everyone laughs and joins in.
                         
                          EVERYONE
           One more time...play it again...
                         
          The band begins the song for the second time. CHARLIE
          enters the cafe and goes directly to his uncle who embraces
          him.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
                          (SHOUTING BOISTEROUSLY
           over the music)
           Take a drink!
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (SHOUTING)
           Ok.
                         
          CHARLIE sits next to his uncle and looks around at the crowd
          in the cafe which is now singing along with the band.
          GIOVANNI is smiling broadly. Loud applause follow the end
          of the song and the band tries clumsily to make its way
          through the crowd and out of the cafe.
                         
           44.
                         
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Hey, where you been?
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (SMILING NERVOUSLY)
           Oh...around...why?
                         
                          GIOVANNI
                          (LEANING CLOSER)
           You heard what happened to GROPPI,
           eh?
                         
          CHARLIE gets very nervous at the mention of GROPPI'S name.
                         
                          CHARLIE

           me...all I know is...
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           (cuts CHARLIE off
           with a gesture of his forefinger)
           Our friend, Groppi, went to his
           mother's house. And when he was
           there...at night...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          An old woman is sitting in front of the television watching
          JOHNNY CARSON'S TONIGHT SHOW.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           (continues in voice over)
           ...he walks into his mother's room
           where she's watching
           television...and he says to her...
                         
          GROPPI has entered the room with his back to the camera.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           ...that he's sorry.
                         
          GROPPI leaves the frame. The old woman looks up from the
          television.
                         
                          OLD WOMAN
           It's all right.
                         
          WE SEE GROPPI walking towards the bathroom.

           (voice over continued)
           ...he goes in the next room...
                         
          GROPPI TURNS ON the bathroom light.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           (voice over continued)
           ...he takes a gun and puts it in
           his mouth and...
                         
          GROPPI stands with the gun in his hand. He lifts it to his
          head. He puts the barrel into his mouth. He pulls the
          trigger.

           (with an Italian hand gesture)
           ...so...
                         
          CHARLIE is visibly shocked.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
                          (SMILING)
           How do you like that, eh? He was
           always a little crazy, y'know...
           Groppi... a little crazy.
                         
          CHARLIE looks up to see MICHAEL, standing at the entrance of
          the cafe. He waves to CHARLIE in a friendly manner. CHARLIE
          waves back and GIOVANNI looks up, squinting to see who it is.
          MICHAEL does not approach the table. In respect to GIOVANNI
          he signals to CHARLIE that he would like to see him outside.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (GRUDGINGLY)
           Not now...in a few minutes...ok?
                         
          MICHAEL is surprised at being spoken to in such a curt
          manner, especially in GIOVANNI'S presence because he feels
          he has lost status. CHARLIE and GIOVANNI continue their
          conversation.

           talked to him...what more can I
           do...? Tonight at the party all

           All right...but understand, I don't
           like being taken advantage of. I
           mean you're in there talking with
           your uncle and all...This is
           embarassing.

           We'll settle it tonight.
                         
          Two YOUNG BOYS about 15 years old walk up to CHARLIE.

          He points to MICHAEL.

           Y'know that's illegal.

           Ok. Wait here.
                         
          MICHAEL goes to TONY, who has been standing in front of the

          back to the waiting boys.

           (to the boys)
           C'mon. Get in the car.
                         
          The four of them get into TONY'S car. They drive to
          CHINATOWN.

           Ok, you guys get out, and wait here
           for me.
                         
                          BOYS
           Why?
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I gotta get the stuff.
                         
                          BOYS
           Can't we come with you?
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Nobody sees where I get the stuff.
           That's good business. I'll be back
           in thirty minutes.

          They start to get out.
                         
                          MICHAEL

           Well, maybe they do that in
           Riverdale, but down here we take
           cash. Now, you got it or not?
                         
          They give him the money.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Ok. Now wait here...and keep your
           mouths shut!
                         
          The car pulls away.

          INT. WEST SIDE TENEMENT APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          TONY enters the bathroom, turns on the light and locks the
          door. Party noises can be heard in the background TONY is
          wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War I "dough
          boy". Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't
          be seen. He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red
          Jello. He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly
          begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming
          water.

          LIVING ROOM & KITCHENETTE - PARTY - NIGHT
                         
          Most of the characters that were at the club the other night
          are present at the party. Many of them are dressed in semi-
          masquerade outfits. Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms.
          One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are
          in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift.
          MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi
          tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his
          mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a "Bela Lugosi"
          look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys,
          proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY
          comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo
          from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He
          stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer
          to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down.
                         
                          TERESA
           Oh sure! I know her Michael...In
           fact, I saw her a few days ago
           under a bridge in Jersey, making
           out with a nigger.
                         
          MICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I
           kissed her.
                         
          He wipes his lips with his cape.
                         
          The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is
          attempting to open his going away presents, one of which
          turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He
          attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails
          however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group
          applauds.
                         
           53.
                         
                         
          Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up. The
          door opens and CHARLIE appears, arms outstretched, dressed
          as the ressurected Christ - with white robes, fake beard and
          hair, and artificial wounds. His arms stretch out wider.
          The initial shock wears off and TONY greets him.
                         
                          TONY
                          (SMILING)
           Hallelujah!!
                         
          CHARLIE enters in mock holiness.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I have come to create order...
           Scotch and water please.
                         
          They all laugh. The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to
          and fro blessing all in the room. TONY is delighted with
          the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite
          him, and the others gather around. The party is getting
          noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE
          plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice
          is filled with wine and water, TONY pours the scotch over
          his fingers first.
                         
          CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest
          would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass.
          TONY then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-water.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           May God be with you.
                         
                          TONY
           'And with your spirit.'
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (gesturing with his drink)
           Salute!!!
                         
          Everyone drinks after repeating the toast. The crowd around
          them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have
          fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a
          skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his
          mouth. It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well.
                         
                          TONY
           (taking on the guise
           of an interviewer)
           'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           'Dost thou say this of thyself, or
           have others told thee of me?'
                         
           54.
                         
                         
                          TONY
           'Am I a Jew? Thy own people and
           the chief priests have delivered
           thee to me. What hast thou done?'
                         
          MICHAEL and a few of the others gather around again as they
          continue.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           'My kingdom is not of this world.
           If my kingdom were of this world my
           followers would have fought that I
           might not be delivered to the Jews.
           But, as it is my kingdom is not
           from here.'
                         
                          TONY
           'Thou art then a king?'
                         
                          CHARLIE
           'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This
           is why I was born and why I have
           come into this world, to bear
           witness to the truth. Everyone who
           is of the truth hears my voice.'
                         
          TONY leans over towards CHARLIE.
                         
                          TONY
           'What is the truth?'
                         
          The others around them give mock applause. TONY smiles and
          nods his head to them. CHARLIE laughs. They drink. Someone
          hits CHARLIE on the back of the head. CHARLIE startled,
          looks up.
                         
                          TONY

           it that struck thee?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I don't know, but God help him if
           he does it again!
                         
          They all laugh.
                         
          INT. SAME APARTMENT - NEXT ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          CHARLIE is talking to MICHAEL. The conversation is serious.
          CHARLIE has not lost his sense of humor.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           He said he'd be here.
                         
           55.
                         
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           He'll be here. Look, take this for
           now.
                         
          He hands MICHAEL a twenty dollar bill from under his robe.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You kiddin. The way it is now this
           isn't even interest for two hours.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (putting the bill
           back into his pocket)
           How much was the original loan again?
                         
                          MICHAEL
           $500. He borrowed that because he
           wanted to pay off his other loans...
           now, counting the interest...it's
           almost $3,000.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at
           $3,000?
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Charlie, this is business.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (avoiding the issue)
           'But I say to you, love your
           enemies, do good to those who hate
           you, and pray for those who
           persecute...'
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I'll tell you who you can pray
           for... Next payday, I'll be at
           Tony's Place...Johnny better show
           or I find him and break his
           legs...and I mean it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (in the same manner)
           'But I say to you not to resist the
           evildoer; on the contrary, if
           someone takes thy tunic, let him
           take thy cloak as well...to him who
           asks of thee, give; and from him
           who would borrow of thee do not
           turn away!
                         
           56.
                         
                         
                          MICHAEL
                          (EXASPERATED)
           He could at least show some respect
           and show his face, even if he
           doesn't have the money...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (more serious now)
           'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not
           come out from it until thou hast
           paid the last penny.'
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You said it.
                         
          A loud scream is heard from the bathroom.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now
          filled with congealed red jello. The boys are laughing and
          shoving each other about roughly. CHARLIE comes out of the
          next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through
          the madness, his arms outstretched. One boy kneels and
          kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him. There
          is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the
          bathroom and near the doorway. CHARLIE promises to save the
          sinner as he pushes his way through. He helps the girl
          remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the
          bathtub. It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She
          caresses him and they find themselves kissing. The others
          storm into the bathroom and grab CHARLIE.
                         
                          EVERYONE
           Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ!
           Crucify him!!
                         
          They drag CHARLIE into the next room where, amidst all the
          shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are
          placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their
          own "dog fight". They are flying the planes out the open
          window.
                         
          CHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few
          lines over their laughter.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           'Father...forgive them...for they
           know not...what they do...'
                         
          The doorbell rings and TONY answers it. It is TERESA and
          she looks very worried.
                         
           57.
                         
                         
                          TERESA
           Charlie...? Charlie here...?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         BLACK & WHITE
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
                         
          CHARLIE and TERESA dash from a tenement doorway. CHARLIE is
          still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give
          the effect of being a bulky overcoat.
                         
                          TERESA
                          (FRANTICALLY)
           The building on the corner. That
           one! He's been on the roof a half
           hour now!
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Now don't get excited. Don't get
           excited!!
                         
          It is very late and the streets are deserted. At the corner
          of the building in question, a few of JOHNNY BOY'S friends
          cling to the wall for safety. When they see CHARLIE and
          TERESA they call out.
                         
                          FRIENDS
           Charlie, stay there...He's crazy...
           He's got a 22.
                         
          TERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the
          block and she leaves reluctantly.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Johnny it's me, Charlie.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight
          on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Don't come any closer!!!
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Cut it out stupid. It's me.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the
          wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run
          for the doorway of the building across the street. He
          enters the building that leads to the roof.
                         
                         BLACK & WHITE

          EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - NIGHT
                         
          CHARLIE has reached the roof.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Charlie...pssst. Over here.
                         
          He laughs with glee.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           What are you...crazy?
                         
          He slaps JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Hey...don't do that...I'm only
           scaring them.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Stupid bastard...you get your
           cousin half-sick over this.
                         
          The boys below are still clinging to the walls of the
          building. JOHNNY is oblivious to CHARLIE'S statement.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Watch this.
                         
          He takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass
          cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick
          through the top layer of cork. He lights it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           What the fuck...
                         
          JOHNNY BOY tosses it over the building and it blows up in
          mid-air. The boys below rush madly away. Lights go on in
          the tenements around them. The explosion was quite loud.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Let's get out of here.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (LAUGHING)
           Did you see them run!
                         
                         BLACK & WHITE
                         
          EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT
                         
          CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are sneaking over a fence in an old
          cemetary which is part of their neighborhood. It surrounds
          their church and dates back to the beginning of the 19th
          century. No one is buried there any longer.
                         
           59.
                         
                         
          It is very quiet and dark. They sit and rest. CHARLIE is
          still in his makeup.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I swear to God Charlie...my arm
           still hurts from the car
           accident...that's why I didn't go
           to work. I swear it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (ANGRY)
           That's not going to help.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I'm going to work this week...I
           mean it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           It's impossible for you to catch up
           on the loan now...the interest is
           going up...$3,000...do you realize
           that, flash?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Big deal...in the meantime, it's
           done...I'll still try to help you
           out...You know that...but you gotta
           show some effort...some respect...
           understand?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Charlie, you know the best way to
           take care of this whole mess.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           How?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (COAXING)
           If you had a little talk with your
           uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           That'll help you out fine. That's
           the best way for you, not for me!
           I swear to God, I'll rip you open
           if my uncle ever hears a word about
           this. You understand? I don't
           care what happens, he doesn't find
           out.
                          (MORE)
                         
           60.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           I don't get involved with anything,
           you understand that? Nothing! I'm
           clean as far as you know...right?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           That's what I get for getting
           involved. Look, on pay-day at
           least show up at Tony's Place to
           meet him, ok? This way he doesn't
           think that you're trying to screw
           him. If you show good faith and
           save his face maybe we can talk and
           he'll take off the interest or make
           different payment arrangements or
           something... understand? I'm not
           asking I'm telling you!!
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I understand.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and
          then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems
          totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
          the distance.
                         
          CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take
          them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a
          sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his
          attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top
          floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
          having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.
          Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
          windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
          the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the
          fire escape.
                         
          CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard
          and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find
          JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           'Could you not, then, watch one
           hour with me?'
                         
          He wakes JOHNNY BOY up.

          CHARLIE is sitting in the corner. The restaurant is in the
          same condition that it was the last time he was there.
          While CHARLIE waits for his uncle in his semi-private
          corner, a handful of old Mafiosi, invited by GIOVANNI, sit
          at another table. GIOVANNI enters with MARIO. The old
          Mafiosi are greeted first. They rise and kiss GIOVANNI on
          the cheek. CHARLIE is very impressed at their respectful
          showing. The waitresses and everyone else in the club treat
          them all like royalty.

          OSCAR approaches the table where CHARLIE, GIOVANNI, and
          MARIO are seated and greets them warmly.
                         
                          OSCAR
           Put the menus away. I, personally
           do the cooking tonight.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Fine...that's why I'm here.

          CHARLIE is visible awed by GIOVANNI and MARIO'S confidence
          and power. He is behaving as if he were at a job
          interview...very formally. CHARLIE had often had dinner
          with his uncle but this time the conversation is more
          pointed. Their conversation is mostly in ITALIAN WITH
          ENGLISH TITLES. They are discusssing GROPPI'S suicide.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I really couldn't believe it when
           you told me, you know that?
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Well, he was always a little
           crazy... he puts a gun in his

                          CHARLIE
           Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was
           more upset about that than about
           Groppi, that's for sure.

           You know, this boy over here, once,
           long time ago, tried to enrich my
           mind...so he gives me a book by
           this Hemin fella...to read, so I
           read it.

           good.

           What I don't understand is why you
           have to go to college to read these

           It's only a couple of courses...just
           for the draft.
                         
                          MARIO
           Charlie, couple of courses isn't
           enough to get you student deferred...
           I mean if they wanted to draft you,
           you would've been drafted by now.
                         
          CHARLIE feels that it would be better not to pursue the point.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           What Mario's trying to tell you,
           Charlie, is that you're wasting
           your time with those "couple of
           courses" ...you don't need them.
           There are a lot of things that can
           be taken care of...you know what I
           mean?
                         
          They all laugh.

          They become aware of the T.V. set which is on in the rear of
          the back room where they are dining. The news is
          on...politics, society, and war.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           These politicians...they talk nice.
                         
          CHARLIE listen attentively, but obviously has heard
          GIOVANNI'S philosophy before.

           same...they're in there by having
           something on somebody...and when
           that doesn't work...they fight...Our
           life has honor...we have no show to
           put on because we do what we have
           to do. They know where to come
           when they need us. I realize this
           during the war...World War II...Vito
           Genovese... during WWII he worked

                          MARIO
           In the fifties when the communists
           started in with this country and
           they tried to clean them out, we
           offered to do it for them...but
           they didn't want us to...so we kept
           out of it.
                         
          CHARLIE nods.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
                          (TO CHARLIE)
           I told this...the same thing to
           your father thirty years ago...I
           told him what to do...but he didn't
           listen.

          their coffee and ainsette.

           named after me...
                          (SARCASTIC)
           nice, eh? This Johnny Boy is like
           your mister Groppi...a little crazy.
           It's nice you should help him out
           because of his family and our
           family but watch yourself...Don't
           spoil anything.

           Yeah. That's what I said, sick in
           the head.
                         
          CHARLIE nods.
                         
                          GIOVANNI
           Her mother and father come to me
           and ask advice...she wants to
           leave...get her own
           apartment...worries them sick...what
           am I gonna tell them? Lock her up?

                          GIOVANNI
           Who knows? It's not hard to figure
           out what she'll wind up like. When
           the respect for parents breaks
           down, that's bad...you know I'm
           "cumpari" with them...so I take an
           interest. You live next door, keep
           an eye open...but don't get involved.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           All right.

           Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
                         
          CHARLIE heads for the kitchen.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONFESSION)
           ...looks good...things look good,
           if I may say so myself. Don't you
           agree? Unless there's something
           You know that I don't know?
                         
                          CUT TO:

          INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          CHARLIE is examining the kitchen closely. A black cook is
          working hard, taking a piece of meat off the grill. He
          carefully prepares a dish.
                         
                          COOK
           Hi Charlie.
                         
          CHARLIE smiles and moves in closer to the grill. The cook
          is sweating and mopping his brow.
                         
                          COOK
                          (CONTINUING)
           Man, it's hot as Hell in here,
           every day like going through Hell
           in here.
                         
          CHARLIE moves in closer and the COOK continues preparing the
          food.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (SMILING)
           Hot as hell...You're not the only
           one going through Hell kid.
                         
                          COOK
           Maybe so...but at this pay it ain't
           worth it...that much I can tell you.
                         
          CHARLIE hasn't been listening to the COOK. He has become
          fascinated with the flames on the grill. They remind him of
          an old device from his Catholic School days. CHARLIE brings
          his hand forward and closer to the fire, testing the pain of
          the "Fires of Hell."
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONFESSION)
           'If thy hand is an occasion of sin
           to thee, cut it off. It is better
           for thee to enter into life maimed
           than having two hands to go into
           hell, into the unquenchable fire.
           'Where their worm dies not and the
           fire is not quenched.'
                         
          CHARLIE'S hand touches the flame. He winces. Music in.
                         
          INT. TONY'S CAR (NEW CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE-TOP UP) - DAY
                         
          CHARLIE, JOHNNY, TONY and JIMMY are driving along in TONY'S
          car. As they talk, a derelict takes advantage of a red
          light to wipe their windshield.
                         
           68.
                         
                         
          TONY rolls up the window and rolls the car forward a bit to
          force the derelict out of the way.
                         
                          TONY
           Is it near Sullivan Street?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No - by Bedford.
                         
                          TONY
           Oh - you gotta show me. I always
           get lost in the village.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Next time, bet with your own kind.
                         
                          JIMMY
           The number was 235 - I bet it
           combination.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           It'll be OK - I know those guys.
           They won't stiff you.
                         
                          JIMMY
           I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my
           grandfather - and when he died, the
           number of the funeral parlour was
           235 - so when I dreamt...
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Yeah, yeah - enough.
                         
          They arrive at the bar.
                         
                          JOEY
           Hello Charlie, you canonized yet?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No - not yet - just blessed.

           On Friday, the 25th--I placed it

                          JOEY
                          (BEING DISTRACT)
           I never heard of it.

                          CHARLIE
           Oh Joey, really...we're all friends
           here--let's cut the bullshit.
                         
                          JOEY
           (begins to chuckle)
           ...Well...
                          (TO JIMMY)
           you got a good friend here--come to
           think of it, I do remember now.

           (nudging JOHNNY BOY)
           (under his breath)
           Shut up.
                         
                          JOEY
                          (MAKING EXCUSE)
           Well, Friday's are busy--a mistake
           can be made y'know. Have another
           drink.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Whatever, just lets settle this and
           it's all forgotten.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I don't forget nothin.
                         
          JOEY looks at JOHNNY BOY but decides to let it pass. CHARLIE
          gives JOHNNY BOY a dirty look. Music is playing on a juke
          box. Several girls stand nearby listening to both the music
          and the discussion. JOHNNY BOY looks over at them and then
          at JOEY.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Lower the fuckin music--I can't
           hear nothin.
                         
                          JOEY
           The girls like it loud.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Girls? You call those skanks girls?!
                         
          JOEY, his friends, and the girls all look up. JOEY'S
          attitude changes.
                         
           70.
                         
                         
                          JOEY
                          (TO CHARLIE)
           What's the matter with this kid?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Keep your mouth shut.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           You tell me that in front of these
           creeps?
                         
                          JOEY
           We won't pay...
                         
                          JIMMY
           Why? We just said...
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           We won't pay...because this guy
           (pointing to JIMMY)
           is a...mook.
                         
                          JIMMY
           But I didn't say nothin.
                         
          The fellows look at each other bewildered.
                         
                          JOEY
                          (TO JIMMY)
           We don't pay mooks!
                         
          Nobody knows what a mook is. JIMMY'S attitude now changes.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (ANGRILY)
           A mook...I'm a mook...
                          (PAUSES)
           What's a mook?
                         
          CHARLIE can no longer control the situation as tempers rise.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You can't call me a mook!
                         
          JIMMY swings at JOEY. A fight breaks out. JIMMY, CHARLIE,
          TONY and JOHNNY BOY are beaten. CHARLIE, not badly hurt
          manages to calm everything down. The police arrive to break
          up the fight. People look iin as the two cops walk into the
          bar. The boys stop fighting immediately as they see the
          cops.
                         
           71.
                         
                         
          In fact, they treat CHARLIE and the others as friends--
          helping them up off the floor, dusting off the clothes, etc.
          The police search everyone. When they ask who started it--
          what happened, etc. everybody including CHARLIE and the
          others cover for everyone else. "It was a joke officer"
          "He's my cousin" "We were just kidding," etc.
                         
          The cops nod. "Play nice now" and leave.
                         
          Everyone apologizes to each other. They drink again.
          JOHNNY BOY doesn't say a word--just stares.
                         
                          JOEY
           We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we
           just don't like being moved in on.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you?
           Let's have another drink and forget
           about it.
                         
          They drink again. JOEY gives JIMMY the money, JIMMY goes to
          count it.
                         
                          JOEY
           Don't count it...it's all there.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Count it.
                         
                          JOEY
           Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
                         
          JOEY extends his hand. JIMMY and CHARLIE shake. JOEY
          extends his hand to JOHNNY.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag.
                         
          CHARLIE and the others "Oh no."
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Shut up stupid.
                         
          He is interrupted by a flying fist. The fight breaks out
          anew. They barely make it to the door. JIMMY is out first,
          with his cash. They run down the street. The west side
          boys don't chase them but stand by their bar shouting after
          them.
                         
          JOHNNY is laughing as he runs. CHARLIE yells at him.

                          JIMMY
           Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.

           money.
                         
          They reach the car. TONY heads in first behind the wheel.
                         
                          TONY
           (about to take off)
           Fuck youse all.
                         
          The others jump in.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You got no honor Tony. Charge!
                         
          The car starts off.
                         
          Garbage and garbage pails are tosses after them as the boys
          take off.

          A LONG-HAIRED ROCK GROUP
                         
          The lead guitarist holds his guitar out like a machine gun
          and strums frantically on it swinging it back and forth at
          the audience and then at the rest of the group. As he does
          so, the rest of the group falls "dead" over their instruments.

           along... we're still working on our

          before their evening performance and they can be heard
          breaking up the session in the background. TONY and the

           well today's Tuesday, payday. I
           haven't seen him all

          her dressing room. She is putting on her makeup. CHARLIE
          is still very attracted to her. He enters her room.

           understand...nothing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         CHARLIE'S WINDOW
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is at CHARLIE's window. Through it he can see
          TERESA lying on the bed in tears and CHARLIE pacing back and
          forth across the room.
                         
           79.
                         
                         
          He is still talking loudly, JOHNNY BOY doesn't seem to pay
          any attention to the fact that TERESA is in CHARLIE'S
          bedroom. He opens the window and jumps in, smiling
          sarcastically. TERESA and CHARLIE are startled. CHARLIE
          grabs JOHNNY BOY by his coat collar.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Where were you? Answer me, you
           sonofabitch! Where were you?
                         
          TERESA is frightened and rushes towards CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY
          reacts to the scene with uncontrolled laughter. CHARLIE is
          outraged and slaps him across the face but JOHNNY continues
          to laugh. TERESA screams.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (TO TERESA)
           Shut up!
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (TO TERESA)
           Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't
           wanna get Charlie here in trouble,
           do we?...We love Charlie.
                         
          CHARLIE flings JOHNNY BOY against a wardrobe, letting go of
          his collar.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You had me going crazy!
                         
          TERESA is crying. JOHNNY goes into the kitchen and CHARLIE
          follows. TERESA stays in the doorway.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT
                         
          JOHNNY BOY takes a drink of water from the sink as he talks.
          CHARLIE is calmer now; calm enough to realize that JOHNNY
          has figured out his true relationship to TERESA. He tries
          to protect himself.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Your cousin here was getting sick,
           worrying about you. We've been in
           here calling...
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
                         
          CHARLIE is embarrassed and TERESA is afraid.
                         
           80.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (CONTINUES)
           Well kids...have the bans been
           announced yet?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't be smart.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember.
           I'm so stupid that you have to look
           out for me, remember?
                         
          TERESA is crying.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Don't be upset Teresa. You have to
           understand Charlie, here...he gives
           of himself to help others...
                         
                          TERESA
           I'm going to go home.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           No, you stay.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Johnny, I swear to God, if you open
           your mouth about any of this...
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (ANGRY)
           Me? I wouldn't say a word to my
           aunt and uncle...or even your
           uncle, Charlie...
                         
          TERESA makes it to the door and opens it quickly. JOHNNY
          BOY grabs her to keep her from leaving. CHARLIE rushes
          towards them and pulls JOHNNY BOY away. By now, they are
          halfway down the hall.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (SHOUTING)
           Charlie...I always wondered about
           her...what happens when she comes?
           Does she get one of those fits? Eh?
           That would be something to see...
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is interrupted by CHARLIE'S fist as it lands a
          solid punch on the right side of his hand. TERESA screams
          and rushes to separate them.
                         
           81.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           You rat bastard!! Don't hit me
           again!!
                         
          CHARLIE stops.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I think I will fuckin go see your
           uncle right now...he'd be interested.
                         
          CHARLIE rushes JOHNNY BOY towards the stairs. They bump
          into TERESA, slamming her against the wall.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see
           what happens to you without me.
                         
          TERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to
          CHARLIE'S uncle.
                         
                          TERESA
           No...no...don't.
                         
          TERESA falls, hitting the stairs with a thud. She lies
          there moaning and tossing her head. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY
          go to help her.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           What do I do? You know anything
           about this?
                         
          JOHNNY BOY steps over TERESA to go down the stairs. He turns.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I don't know...she's your girl...I
           gotta go.
                         
          CHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is
          getting worse.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Hate to miss the floor show, though.
                         
          CHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down
          the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY
          BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors
          and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries
          to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY
          BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth
          trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE
          screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY.
                         
           82.
                         
                         
          The neighbors take over. One woman appears to know how to
          administer aid to TERESA.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. CHARLIE'S BUILDING - STAIRS
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is halfway down the stairs by now. The neighbor
          takes care of TERESA. While CHARLIE dashes down the stairs,
          CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY in the ground floor hallway.
                         
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE
                         
          In the deserted factory section of Manhattan, JOHNNY BOY and
          CHARLIE stand next to a corregated metal garage door.
          CHARLIE smashes JOHNNY BOY against the door sending
          resounding echoes into the street.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You crazy bastard! What are you
           trying to do, ruin me?
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge
          of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door again--again
          the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You...
                         
          Again, JOHNNY BOY is thrown up against the door.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You threaten me with my uncle?
           After what I'm doing for you?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           What you're doing for me isn't
           worth it...believe me!
                         
          CHARLIE slaps JOHNNY BOY and pushes him against the door
          again.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Then don't show up tonight and see
           what happens.
                         
          CHARLIE stops. He digs his hands into JOHNNY'S pockets but
          he can't find anything.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           How much have you got for Michael
           tonight?
                         
           83.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I only got eight bucks on me.
                         
          CHARLIE stares at JOHNNY BOY for a moment then puts his hand
          into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and
          three ones.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Here, take twenty bucks. With your
           eight that makes twenty-eight bucks
           you give Michael. I keep the
           thirteen for the weekend. Maybe
           we'll eat some Chinese food later.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY doesn't take it. CHARLIE forces it into his hand.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Take it. I'm doing it for you,
           stupid!
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           No you're not...
                         
          CHARLIE, calmer now, is feeling ashamed.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Oh, cut it out, will ya?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is
           nothing. The only way to do it is
           through your uncle...think about it
           will you?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           NO!!! What do you think I am,
           crazy???
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           No, I just want to help myself,
           that's all.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Come on.
                         
          He tugs JOHNNY BOY along.
                         
                          CUT TO:

                          TONY
           You're over an hour late. Michael
           said he'll be back later, though...

          CHARLIE takes a drink. JOHNNY BOY sits at the bar. The
          place is beginning to empty and the show is over. CHARLIE
          takes TONY aside.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Watch this kid for me. I have to
           go someplace but I'll be back soon
           to get Michael and him together.
           Don't even let him go to the
           bathroom.
                         
          He turns to JOHNNY BOY.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Don't you move!!!
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
                          (SULKING)
           I'll be here. Don't worry.
                         
          JOHNNY orders a drink.

                          CHARLIE
           6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast
           please.
                         
          The cab takes off. They soon arrive at their destination.
                         
                          CAB DRIVER
           Where do you want me to stop?
                         
          CHARLIE leans back into the seat and peeks out the window.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No...don't stop...just pass real
           slow, OK?
                         
          CHARLIE looks out the window and sees DIANE, the negro
          stripper. She is standing on the corner waiting for him.
          CHARLIE nods his head for the driver to stop.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Stop here.
                          (HE HESITATES)
           No...what am I...crazy??? Take me
           back to where you picked me up.

                          (SIGHING)
           Ok.
                         
          The car drives away, passing DIANE who is on the corner.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. TONY'S PLACE
                         
          CHARLIE is back inside the club.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Back so soon.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Mind your own business.
                         
          TONY sets up drinks for them and pours them into shot glasses.
                         
          CHARLIE strikes a match and lights each glass... little blue
          flames dance along the rims of the glasses.
                         
                          TERESA
           Hey, cut it out. Will ya?
                         
          He blows out the flames. CHARLIE moves to the other and of
          the room with his drink.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONFESSION)
           You can see things aren't going too
           well for me at the moment. My
           willpower and powers of persuasion
           are not what they usually are today.
           My ability to control events and
           situations are wanting. I know. I
           know...what can I say...I offer
           this as part of my penance.
                         
          A young couple, two of the few people left in the place, are
          having a hushed quarrel at the end of the bar. The boy
          leaves for the men's room.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (TO TONY)
           Who's the girl?
                         
                          TONY
           Jewish...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           How do you know?
                         
           86.
                         
                         
                          TONY
           Look at her.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           She don't look Jewish.
                         
                          TONY
           Sure she is. She's always in here
           with some different guy. You know
           the way they are.
                         
          CHARLIE approaches the girl.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I love you.
                         
          The girl looks at him, first embarrassed, then annoyed.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (SMILING)
           Ever since that first day I saw you
           at the convent with the nuns,
           playing volleyball, I couldn't help
           myself.
                         
                          GIRL
           You Italian?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Yeah why?
                         
                          GIRL
           You don't look it.
                         
          The girl laughs. Her boyfriend comes out of the men's room.
          He has her coat in his hand.
                         
                          GIRL
           (to the Boy)
           Fuck off.
                         
                          BOY
                          (STUNNED)
           What do you mean?
           (he looks at CHARLIE)
           ...let's go.
                         
                          GIRL
           You go...I'm staying.
                         
                          BOY
           Let's go!
                         
           87.
                         
                         
          CHARLIE reaches over and grabs the GIRL'S arm tightly. She
          looks up, startled, and the boy appears to be frightened.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           It's obvious that the girl doesn't
           want to accompany you, isn't it?
                         
                          BOY
           Look fella...this is private...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Nothing's private...
                         
          The GIRL is really scared now.
                         
                          GIRL
           I'd like to leave.
                         
          CHARLIE won't let go of her arm. She tries to pull away but
          his grip tightens.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Whether she wants to or not...she's
           not going.
                         
                          BOY
           Let go of her.
                         
          The GIRL is in tears.
                         
                          GIRL
           Stop it...you're hurting me.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Take her away from me...I mean
           physically take her away from me.
                         
          He is holding her so tightly that she is doubling over in
          pain. The BOY, although he is scared, lunges at CHARLIE.
          There is a brief scuffle which TONY breaks up.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK ALLEY - BLACK AND WHITE - NIGHT
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is lifting the lid of a garbage pail. He takes
          out a brown paper bag and opens it. He takes a small .22
          pistol from it and puts it inside his jacket, then replaces
          the bag in the garbage pail.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          INT. TONY'S PLACE - BAR AREA
                         
          MICHAEL has entered the club. The BOY and GIRL are gone.
          TONY is with CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY, whose return went
          unnoticed.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           What's it gonna be? I was here
           tonight...you kept me waiting for
           over an hour.
                         
          MICHAEL has two friends with him.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           Hello, Michael. I've got something
           for you...not much...but...
                         
                          CHARLIE
           He has about twenty-eight bucks...
           it's all he has on him.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Better than nothing.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY takes out a ten dollar bill and hands it to him.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Where's the rest?
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Yeah, where's the rest?
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I bought a few rounds of drinks
           while waiting.
                         
          CHARLIE is stunned.
                         
                          MICHAEL
                          (ANGRY)
           Twenty-eight bucks is enough of an
           insult...I was gonna take the
           twenty-eight bucks because of
           Charlie here...but ten bucks!
                         
          MICHAEL takes the ten dollars, crumples it and flings it
          into JOHNNY BOY'S face. JOHNNY BOY picks it up and slowly
          smooths it out. He sets it on fire as he talks.
                         
           89.
                         
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           You make me laugh, Michael...you
           know that? I've borrowed money all
           over the neighborhood and never
           paid it back...so I couldn't borrow
           anymore from them...so who's the
           only jerk off left that I can
           borrow from without paying
           back...YOU. Because that's what I
           think of you...Jerk off. I fuck
           you where you breathe!
                         
          MICHAEL lashes out at JOHNNY BOY with the back of his hand.
          JOHNNY BOY tosses the flaming bill at MICHAEL and quickly
          pulls out his .22 pistol. Everyone is shocked.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (MUTTERING)
           You're really crazy.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You're not going to use that gun,
           Johnny.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY doesn't answer but holds the gun straight at
          MICHAEL'S face. MICHAEL turns to go, defying JOHNNY BOY.
          His friends follow. When he reaches the doorway, he turns.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You don't have the guts to use
           that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony,
           and of course you John...be seeing
           you.
                         
          They leave.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY is still frozen with the gun in his hand, pointing
          it at mid-air. CHARLIE slams JOHNNY BOY across the face
          with his fist. TONY takes the gun from his hand.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You stupid bastard! Never pull a
           gun unless you intend to use it.
                         
          He hits JOHNNY BOY again.
                         
                          TONY
                          (HOLDING GUN)
           ...No bullets in it.
                         
          CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY again.
                         
           90.
                         
                         
                          TONY
           Get out of here before this really
           goes up.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Hide the gun. Throw it away.
           Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow
           your car...I think we should take a
           ride...away from here for the
           night...you know what I mean?
                         
                          TONY
                          (RELUCTANTLY)
           Ok...but go to a movie first or
           something...not good to be driving
           around right away. You know you
           can't do much for him now...it's
           out of your hands.

          SCENE FROM "TOMB OF LIGEIA"
                         
          A young girl is in her room with her maid. The maid is
          helping her dress. Eerie music creates a frightening
          atmosphere. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY watch nervously affected
          by the film's mood. The theatre is a 42nd street one with
          lots of sleeping drunks.
                         
          Suddenly, the maid's face begins to contort as if she's
          seeing something horrible. The audience is on edge. The
          young girl sees the maid and shouts "What is it?" - but the
          maid only sneezes.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. NIGHT - TONY'S CONVERTIBLE - BLACK AND WHITE
                         
          CHARLIE is driving. JOHNNY BOY is beside him in the front
          seat. The top od the car is down and CHARLIE is driving
          with no particular destination in mind.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           I think we should see your uncle.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           No.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           This can't be settled any other way
           now...I'll take full blame.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Forget it.

           What are you going to do? Hide me?

           Good idea.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock
          song.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (CONFESSION)
           I guess you could safely say that
           this evening has been so far very
           unimpressive as far as my efforts
           are concerned...more unproductive.
           Now, I'd like to know what you do,
           for an encore, Lord? I know
           penance is penance but this is
           something else.
                         
          JOHNNY BOY opens his eyes.
                         
                          JOHNNY BOY
           What are you talking to yourself???
                         
          He turns up the radio.
                         
                          CHARLIE
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Go ahead! Play the radio...play
           music...you're going to a party...
           louder! Go ahead. Louder. A
           party. Lots of fun.
                         
          A black sedan has been driving along parallel to CHARLIE'S
          car, unnoticed by CHARLIE. Otherwise the street is deserted.
          The car begins to drive CHARLIE off the road.
                         
                          CHARLIE

          CHARLIE turns his head to look. JOHNNY BOY looks up. They
          fire the gun.

          A barage of bullets (5 gunshots) hit CHARLIE'S car. CHARLIE
          is hit in the hand. JOHNNY BOY has been hit in the throat.
          He stands up and leans over the windshield of the car,
          spewing blood onto it and into the wind. He is screaming.
          The black sedan turns onto another street.

          CHARLIE is so shocked that the car is completely out of
          control. It goes screeching along the street, swerves, and
          slams into a fire hydrant, breaking it off and causing water
          to shoot out onto the sidewalk, car and street. CHARLIE has
          been thrown from the car. He kneels in the street holding
          his wrist. He is on the yellow letters "FIRE LANE." JOHNNY
          BOY lies against the side of a building--still. CHARLIE
          goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand.
          The police arrive with their guns drawn.

          Back in the neighborhood, the religious fiesta is ending.
          The singers on the bandstand are singing the last song of
          the evening, "Vincino Amare." A crowd of elderly Italian-
          Americans stand below the bandstand and listen. There are
          four singers, their voices projected through a PA system.

          The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers
          come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian.

          in.

          CHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to

          Early morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens.
          CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door
          immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud
          clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks
          around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over
          by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just
          stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing
          something a little ominous.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           My uncle didn't come?

          There is practically no one on the street. The early
          morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits
          at the bottom of the steps.

           He got you outta jail. Now...
           (reaching in pocket)
           he wants you outta the way.
                         
          MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket.

          CHARLIE nods and watches the car pull away. Then he picks
          up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.

          The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement.
          CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the
          crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or
          destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board
          that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce
          planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight
          board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
          and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines
          and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman
          calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE
          continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses
          and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
          dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           I don't know what to say to you...
                         
          The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually
          works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor
          and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of
          dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a
          pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.

           May I help you?
                         
          CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision.
          He apparently does not hear her.
                         
                          CLERK
           Sir, may I help you?
                         
          CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket
          pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to
          her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           (questioning, challenging)
           Where can I go?
                         
          The question is unusual. The clerk looks up. CHARLIE stare
          back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.

FADE IN:

1    INT. DERELICT HOUSE - DAY <> 1 
A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a
crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a
decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should
be.

The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The
hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING
motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again
the picture is FANNED.

As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding
the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a
POLAROID CAMERA.

The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS.

The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy-
breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of
blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at
something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD
on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches
a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp.

Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the
floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts
the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth
should be.

Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his
face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself
into the face of TEDDY (40's, moustache) and we-

3    EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <> 3 
A late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and
approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING.
Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no
blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a
PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard
kills the engine, staring at the pickup.

				LEONARD
		Looks like somebody's home.

Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back.

				TEDDY
		That thing's been here for years.

Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He
inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows.

				LEONARD
		I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't	*
		more than a few days old.

Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the
interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds	*
six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.	*
He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.		*

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		Let's take a look inside.

Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets.
Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard.

4    INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <> 4 
Leonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He
pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and
leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him.

Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin
standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white
strip beneath the photo is handwritten:

"TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134"

Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back,
in the same small handwriting.

Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried,
affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively,

		Fuck this.

Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him,
pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts:

				LEONARD
		YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG
		FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY!

Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark  
house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of
the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD.

				TEDDY
		You don't have a clue, you freak.

Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels.

anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a
HAND-DRAWN CHART showing the layout of some streets, and
stuck to the edges of the chart are POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS,
with ARROWS DRAWN from each photograph to a spot on the map.

Leonard inspects the photos. Some are buildings, some are
people. All have the HANDWRITTEN NOTES on the broad white strip
underneath the image.

Leonard gets Polaroids out of his pocket. The first one is of
the Discount Inn. He STICKS it onto an already-squashed lump    *
of blue tack at the end of an ARROW drawn from a location on
the outskirts of town.

The second photo is a blurred shot of a Brunette turning in a
doorway. The name NATALIE is written under the picture.
Leonard flips it over. On the back are two handwritten
messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over,
but the other one reads:

"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

Leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. He steps
back looking over the Polaroids one by one: Natalie, Burt,
Discount Inn, Teddy.							    *

Leonard sits at the desk and opens the BROWN ENVELOPE. He
takes out a photocopy of a CAR REGISTRATION and a DRIVER'S
LICENSE. Both are in the name of JOHN EDWARD GAMMELL, but	  *

photo.

He turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the
back. It says only:

"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES"

Leonard smiles. He goes to the phone and dials the number on
the Polaroid. A couple of rings, then it's answered.

				TEDDY
		Yup?

				LEONARD
		Mr Gammell?

				TEDDY
		Lenny, is that you?

				LEONARD
		John Gammell?

				TEDDY
		Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there,
		okay? I'm gonna be right over.

				LEONARD
		I'll be waiting.							   *

Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the
back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words:

"THE FACTS:"

Leonard removes his jacket, then starts pulling off his shirt.

He has WRITING TATTOOED ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS.
MESSAGES in different styles of writing, some CRUDE, some
ELABORATE. The messages run in all directions, some UPSIDE-
DOWN, some BACKWARDS. Leonard examines his tattoos,
methodically. From Leonard's POV, the most striking is an
upside-down tattoo on his BELLY which says:

"PHOTOGPAPH: HOUSE, CAR, FRIEND, FOE"

On one FOREARM it says:

"THE FACTS:

FACT 1. MALE

FACT 2. WHITE"

On the other FOREARM:

"FACT 3. FIRST NAME: JOHN OR JAMES

FACT 4. LASTNAME: G-------"

Leonard pulls down his trousers. On his right THIGH, crudely-
lettered:

"FACT 5. DRUG DEALER"

And immediately below this, in elegant, neat lettering:

"FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU"					 *

Leonard takes out the REGISTRATION DOCUMENT and examines it.
Holding the photo of Teddy and the registration document,
Leonard checks off his TATTOOED FACTS:

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		    (under his breath)
		White... male. First name... John. Last
		name... G for Gammell. Drugs. License			  *
		plate.
		    (checks document against tattoo
			on thigh)
		SG... 13... 7... IU. It's him. It's			    *
		actually him.

Leonard looks coldly at Teddy's smiling image.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		I found you, you fuck.

Leonard turns the photo face down, takes a pen and writes:

"HE IS THE ONE"

Leonard drops the pen. Thinks. He looks at his chest through
the mirror and a backwards tattoo suddenly BECOMES CLEAR:

"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"

Leonard buttons his blue shirt, then writes on the back of
Teddy's picture:

"KILL HIM"

Leonard sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he
holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks
the GUN in the back of his waistband.

Leonard, in his boxers and plaid work shirt, shaving foam on

Leonard pulls his shirt off. There is a BANDAGE on his LEFT
ARM. He looks do at the TATTOOS ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH	*
AND ARMS.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		So I can't remember talking to you. What
		did we talk about?
		    (nods)
		Sammy Jankis. Yeah, I guess I tell
		people about Sammy to help them
		understand. Sammy's story helps me
		understand my own situation.

Leonard touches the tattoo on the back of his hand.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless
		notes. But he'd get mixed up. I've got a
		more graceful solution to the memory
		problem. I'm disciplined and organized.
		I use habit and routine to make my life
		possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason
		to make it work.

Leonard can see his reflection in the mirror. He studies the
tattoo across his chest:

"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE".

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		Me? I gotta reason.

Leonard parks the Jaguar, gets out, stops outside the door to
a restaurant, checking its name against a NOTE, written on a    *
SMALL PAPER BAG FROM A PHARMACY. The note says:			  *

"CITY GRILL, MAIN ST. THURSDAY, 1.OOPM MEET NATALIE FOR INFO"

He sticks the note in his pocket and pulls out his Polaroid
photographs. He flips through them until he finds Natalie's.
Leonard flips the picture over. On the back are two
handwritten messages. The first one has been completely
scribbled over, the second reads:

"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

24   INT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN STREET - DAY <> 24 
Leonard enters, walking slowly down the aisle, looking at all
the customers. He makes eye contact with a WOMAN (brunette,
30's) sitting alone, wearing SUNGLASSES. Her face betrays	  *
nothing. Leonard walks past. She sighs and grabs the back of
his jacket as he passes. Leonard spins around.

				LEONARD
		Natalie.

Leonard slips into the seat opposite her. Natalie is pretty,
but has bruising around one eye, and a mark on her lip.

				NATALIE
		You don't remember me.

				LEONARD
		    (friendly smile)
		Sorry, I should have explained. You see,

				LEONARD

Natalie smiles.

Leonard is surprised.

				LEONARD
		It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry
		I can't remember you. It's not personal.

Natalie's smile fades.

				NATALIE
		I'm sorry.

She takes a BROWN ENVELOPE out of her handbag.

Random images of a woman (30's, black hair, plain). Jump cuts
of details: a smile, eating, tucking her hair behind her ear,
pulling on a pair of trousers, watching TV, shouting in
anger. Sitting on the edge of the bed in her underwear, she
TURNS as Leonard pinches her thigh.

				LEONARD (V.O.)
		You can only feel details. Bits and

Leonard opens his eyes. Natalie is looking at him. She nods
and hands him the BROWN ENVELOPE.

				NATALIE

		The crazy part was that this guy who

bubbles, TAPPING it delicately.

		Memory's unreliable.

Teddy snorts.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's
		not even that good. Ask the police,
		eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The
		cops don't catch a killer by sitting
		around remembering stuff. They collect
		facts, make notes, draw conclusions.
		Facts, not memories: that's how you
		investigate. I know, it's what I used to
		do. Memory can change the shape of a room
		or the color of a car. It's an
		interpretation, not a record. Memories
		can be changed or distorted and they're
		irrelevant if you have the facts.

				TEDDY
		You really want to find this guy?

				LEONARD
		He took away the woman I love and he took
		away my memory. He destroyed everything;

		So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But

		Conditioning. Sammy should still be able

		you learn stuff like riding a bike,
		things you don't think about, you just
		get better through practice. Call it
		muscle memory, whatever, but it's a

Sammy PICKS UP an object and gestures to the Doctor for
applause. Sammy goes for a second object, but gets a SHOCK
which makes him recoil in pain. (LEONARD TO SUBSTITUTE)		*

				SAMMY (cont'd)
		Ah! What the fuck?!

Sammy looks ACCUSINGLY at the Doctor.

				DOCTOR
		It's a test, Sammy.

				LEONARD (V.O.)
		Some of the objects were electrified,
		They'd give him a small shock.

BACK TO LEONARD IN MOTEL ROOM

49   INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY #BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE#		49

				LEONARD
		They kept repeating the test, always
		with the same objects electrified. The
		point was to see if he could learn to
		avoid the electrified objects. Not by
		memory, but by instinct.

50   INT. NATALIE'S BEDROOM: MESSY, CHEAPLY BUT ABUNDANTLY	   50
FURNISHED - MORNING <> 
Leonard opens his eyes, naked in bed. He looks around,
confused. With a START, he realizes that someone else is in
the bed: a BRUNETTE with her back to him.

Leonard leans right over her to get a look at her face. It is
NATALIE. The BRUISE on her eye and the MARK on her lip are
worse than before.

She OPENS her eyes and is startled by the sight of Leonard's
hovering face.

				LEONARD
		Sorry. It's only me.

Leonard FLOPS down. Natalie wakes up fully and relaxes.

				NATALIE
		Sleep okay?

				LEONARD
		Yeah. You?

Natalie shrugs. She looks at her bedside clock.

				NATALIE
		I gotta be someplace.

She gets out of bed, wearing pajamas. Leonard swings his legs
out of the bed and realizes that he is wearing trousers and
socks. He looks at his tattoos, as if he has never seen them
before.

				NATALIE (cont'd)
		Pretty weird.

She is smiling at him in the mirror. Leonard smiles, shrugs.

				LEONARD
		Useful. You never write a phone number on
		your hand?

				NATALIE							  *
		    (through mirror)						    *
		I should be able to talk to my friend			  *
		about the license plate today.				    *

				LEONARD							  *
		Yeah, the license plate...					   *

				NATALIE							  *
		    (smiles)							  *
		John G's license plate number. You have			*
		it tattooed on your thigh.					   *

Natalie leaves the room. Leonard pulls down his trousers to	*
reveal two tattoos:							*

"FACT 5: DRUG DEALER"							   *

"FACT 6: LICENSE PLATE NUMBER SG13 1NU"					*

Leonard runs his finger over fact 6, then pulls his trousers    *
up and looks around the room. He spots his suit jacket		*
hanging over the back of a chair. He checks the pockets,
pulls out his Polaroids, flips through them: a Jaguar, the
Discount Inn, Natalie. He flips Natalie's picture over and
looks at the back. There are two messages, but the first one
has been completely scribbled over. The other one reads:

"HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

Leonard stuffs the photos back into his pocket, grabs a white
shirt of f the chair and pulls it on. Natalie comes back in
and starts to apply her makeup.

Natalie takes her eye pencil and writes a NOTE on a SMALL BAG   *

Leonard nods.

				NATALIE (cont'd)
		So will you remember me next time you seo

Leonard shakes his head and reaches for the note. Natalie
grabs his lapel and pulls him down to her, kissing him gently
on the mouth.

				NATALIE (cont'd)
		I think you will.

Leonard heads for the door.

				NATALIE

She tosses him his blue shirt. Leonard looks down at the
white shirt which he has put on. It is way too small.

Sammy sits across the testing table from the Doctor. Sammy
goes for a METAL OBJECT and RECOILS in pain from a SHOCK.

				SAMMY
		Ah! What the fuck?!

				DOCTOR
		It's a test, Sammy.

							    JUMP CUT TO:

AS BEFORE, but Sammy is DRESSED DIFFERENTLY. He goes for an
object and is SHOCKED.

				SAMMY
		Ah! What the fuck?!

				DOCTOR
		It's a test, Sammy.

SAMMY EXTENDS A TREMBLING MIDDLE FINGER.

				SAMMY
		Yeah? Test this you fucking quack.

Sequence of JUMP CUTS of Sammy extending his MIDDLE FINGER
and RECOILING in shock from the objects.

				LEONARD (V.O.)
		Even with total short-term memory loss,
		Sammy should've learned to instinctively
		stop picking up the wrong objects. All
		previous cases of short-term memory loss
		had responded to conditioning in some

Leonard looks into the mirror.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so
		he became helpless. But it works for me.
		I live the way Sammy couldn't. Habit and
		Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

Leonard pulls up in his Jaguar, gets out, rings the front
doorbell. It is opened by Natalie.

				LEONARD
		Natalie, right?

Natalie nods, wary of Leonard's barely concealed anger.
Leonard thrusts a Polaroid photo in her face.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		Who the fuck is Dodd?

The photo is of a MAN who is BOUND, GAGGED, and BLOODY. On
the back of the photo:

"GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE"

Natalie takes the picture and examines it.

				NATALIE
		Guess I don't have to worry about him

She gestures at the BRUISING on her face.

		How do I know he did that to you?

				NATALIE
		I came to you straight after he did it. I

She tries to rip the picture. Leonard watches her try. The
plastic is too strong.

				LEONARD
		You have to burn them.

Natalie scrunches it up and throws it down. Leonard and
Natalie sit down on the couch.

				NATALIE
		You decided to help me. Trust yourself.
		Trust your own judgment. You can

He notices the bottle in his hands as if for the first time. LEONARD (V.O.) Don't feel drunk. Leonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face, then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit. He puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then wearily UNDRESSES. Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR. Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING Dodd against the wall. Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the sink. Leonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD. Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over. Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE POCKET. 51. 77 INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <> 77 Leonard STUMBLES in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around, HITTING Dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle, which does not break. Dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his inside jacket pocket. Leonard stands above him, naked, dripping wet, catching his breath. There is a KNOCK at the door. FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Housekeeping. The sound of a KEY entering the lock. Leonard LEAPS for the door and flips the privacy latch. LEONARD Not just now! Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE. Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd. Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes "DODD" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing: "GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE" Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says: "DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6" * "PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE" Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket. He flips through them until he finds the one of Teddy, then picks up the phone and dials Teddy's number. The phone is answered: (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 52. 77 CONTINUED: 77 TEDDY (O.S.) You know what to do. Then a BEEP. Leonard does not look like he knows what to do. LEONARD Ah, it's a message for Teddy... * Leonard looks at the note. LEONARD (cont'd) I'm at the MOUNTCREST INN on 5th Street, Room 6, and I need you to come over as soon as you get this, it's important. This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye. Leonard hangs up. He looks around the room. He slips the HANDGUN into the bedside drawer, resting it on the GIDEON BIBLE, then swings his feet up onto the bed and lies down. CUT TO: 78 INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 78 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) crooks his neck to hold the * phone. In his hands is the PEN with the NEEDLE taped to it.

MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUEWCE## 79 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) takes the NEEDLE/PEN in one hand and picks up a CIGARETTE LIGHTER in the other.

Leonard puts down the lighter and picks up a second BALL- POINT PEN. 80 EXT. DODD'S MOTEL - DAY <> 80 Leonard's Jaguar pulls up, FAST. Several bits of SHATTERED SAFETY GLASS are still visible in the frame. He parks around the back, out of sight and consults a note. LEONARD (V.0.) I'll get the jump on you, fucker. (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 53. 80 CONTINUED: 80 Leonard RACES up the stairs to the rooms on the second floor. He stops at Room 9, listening. The T.V. is on. Leonard gets a CREDIT CARD out and slips it into the lock gently, with a practiced hand. He leaves the CARD WEDGED in the lock, then steps back from the door and KNOCKS. Leonard watches the POINT OF LIGHT in the PEEPHOLE to Room 9. The point of light GOES OUT. Leonard KICKS the door in, SMASHING THE ROOM'S OCCUPANT BACK INTO THE ROOM. Leonard stands over him, looking down. The man is unconscious, blood on his face. Something is not right. LEONARD (V.O.) Is this the guy? Leonard looks down at his NOTE. The room number given is 6. Leonard looks at the "9" on the door, then down at the unconscious man. LEONARD (cont'd) Fuck! Sorry. Leonard reaches down, GRABS his credit card from where it landed on the floor, and backs out of the doorway, shutting the door on the Unconscious Man. He MOVES QUICKLY to Room 6, slips his credit card in the lock and knocks. No answer, so Leonard slips inside. 81 INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <> 81 Leonard flicks the light on and glances around. There is nothing in the room except an empty VODKA BOTTLE on the bedside table. LEONARD (V.O.) Need a weapon. He grabs the empty vodka bottle, switches the light off and slips into the bathroom. 82 INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - DAY <> 82 Leonard sits down on the toilet, holding the empty bottle by its neck. He reaches out and adjusts the angle of the door. His eyes are alert, he is nervous.

SMALL ALLEY BEHIND A ROW OF TRAILER HOMES - DAY <SEQUENCE>> Leonard is RUNNING FURIOUSLY, arms pumping. LEONARD (V.O.) What the fuck am I doing? Leonard glances to his right, and through a GAP between two trailers he catches a glimpse of Dodd on the other side of the trailer homes, RACING along parallel to Leonard. LEONARD (V.O.) (CONT'D) Chasing him! Leonard CUTS down the next gap between trailers, heading FULL SPEED for Dodd's side. Dodd (without bruises) appears again at the other end of the gap, SEES Leonard, and STARTS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM. There is a GUN in his hand. LEONARD (V.O.) (CONT'D) FUCK! He's chasing me. Leonard SKIDS to a halt and turns around. A BULLET hits the dirt by his feet. He clears the end of the trailer and THROWS himself over a chain link fence, dropping down on the other side and SCRAMBLING through some bushes. He RACES full tilt into a parking lot, looking around, desperate. He can hear a CAR ALARM sounding. He pulls his KEYS OUT and hits the ALARM switch. Hearing the DOUBLE BEEP as the alarm stops, he spots the Jaguar. The Jaguar PEELS OUT just as Dodd emerges from the trailer park. 85 INT. JAGUAR - DAY <> 85 Leonard is breathing hard, looking around nervously. He starts knocking BITS OF BROKEN WINDOW GLASS out of the driver's side window with his elbow then pulling photos and pieces of paper out of his pockets as he drives. Leonard finds a NOTE that gives a description of Dodd, along with the motel and room number where Dodd is staying. CUT TO: 55. 86 INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 86 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) has the NEEDLE/PEN in one hand * and the BROKEN PEN in the other. Leonard DIPS the needle into the clear plastic INK RESERVOIR off the broken pen. 87 EXT. TRAILER PARK PARKING LOT - DAY <> 87 Leonard is in the Jaguar. Dodd (without any bruises) is standing by the window, aiming his gun at Leonard. DODD I haven't made a strong enough impression. LEONARD (amused) Don't be too hard on yourself. Dodd motions for Leonard to open the passenger side door. Dodd gets into the passenger seat, gun on Leonard. Leonard nods to him. LEONARD Seat belt. Leonard starts to reach over his left shoulder with his right hand as if for the seat belt. Dodd watches Leonard's right hand. With his left hand, Leonard opens the door. He rolls out, SLAMMING the door in Dodd's face, and hitting the central locking on his car keys. Leonard TAKES OFF across the asphalt. Dodd tries the doors, then SHOOTS at Leonard, SHATTERING the driver's side window, triggering the CAR ALARM. Dodd climbs through the window and takes off after him. Leonard slips into a trailer park, TRIPPING as he DIVES into a gap between two trailers, STUMBLING over the PLASTIC LAWN FURNITURE and OLD BIKES which litter the narrow gap. He picks himself up and SPRINTS into the alley behind the trailers. He races along behind the trailers. Leonard is RUNNING FURIOUSLY, arms pumping. LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) What the fuck am I doing?

He watches the fur blacken and the plastic eyes melt. Leonard reaches into the bag and pulls out a well-worn PAPERBACK BOOK, whose cover has long-since been ripped off. Leonard flicks through the pages. MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 57. 94 INT. BEDROOM, LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT <>94 Leonard is undressing. Leonard's Wife is in bed, reading the well-worn paperback. LEONARD How can you read that again? LEONARD'S WIFE (without looking up) It's good. LEONARD You've read it a hundred times. LEONARD'S WIFE I enjoy it. LEONARD Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next - LEONARD'S WIFE (looks up, annoyed) Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please. 95 EXT. RESERVOIR - NIGHT <> 95 He places the BOOK on the fire. He reaches into the bag, produces a BRA and a HAIRBRUSH. He puts the bra on the fire, then pulls some BLACK HAIR out of the hairbrush. He holds a few strands out above the fire until they shrivel up in the heat. He does this with a larger clump and it produces a SMALL FLAME so he DROPS it into the fire. LEONARD (V.O.) Probably tried this before. Probably burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't remember to forget you. He DROPS the brush onto the fire, pulls a GREEN ALARM CLOCK out of the bag and adds it to the fire. Once the bag is EMPTY, Leonard places it on the fire. He sits looking at the flames. DISSOLVE TO: 96 EXT. RESERVOIR - DAWN <> 96 The sky has brightened. Leonard KICKS the dying embers apart. 58. 97 INT./EXT. DAWN - THE JAGUAR SPEEDS ALONG <> 97 Leonard looks into his rearview mirror to see a LANDCRUISER following him. Leonard SPEEDS UP, turns right. The Landcruiser sticks behind. LEONARD (V.O.) Do I know this guy? Leonard fishes photographs out of his pocket, examining them. The Landcruiser ACCELERATES until it is uncomfortably close. Leonard slows, turning into a PARKING LOT. The Landcruiser follows. LEONARD (V.O.) He seems to know me. The Landcruiser PULLS ALONGSIDE the Jaguar. Leonard looks over. Dodd (no bruises) is at the wheel. Leonard rolls down his window. LEONARD (V.O.) What the fuck! Dodd pulls out a HASNDGUN and points it at Leonard. Leonard SLAMS on the brakes, JERKING to a halt as the Landcruiser pulls over in front of the Jaguar. 98 EXT. TRAILER PARK PARKING LOT - DAY <> 98 Dodd, gun in hand, gets out of the Landcruiser and approaches. DODD I like your car. LEONARD Thanks. DODD Where'd you get it? LEONARD Interested in buying one? DODD I just want you to tell me how you came by that car. LEONARD I forget. Dodd points his gun at Leonard through the window.

MOTEL ROOM 304 - NIGHT <> 100 Leonard is WOKEN by the sound of a door SHUTTING FIRMLY. He turns his head to see a glow from under the bathroom door. In the dim light he can see a well-worn, COVERLESS PAPERBACK BOOK on the far bedside table. Next to it is a HAIRBRUSH and a drinking glass half-full of water. There is a small STUFFED TOY sitting by the pillow next to Leonard's head. Leonard's eyes are half-closed as he slides his hand onto the other half of the bed, feeling the residual warmth, smiling. He props himself up on one arm, rubs his eyes and reaches over to the SMALL, GREEN ALARM CLOCK, straining to read its numbers in the dim light. He breathes heavily, sleepily and shuts his eyes for a second, UTTERLY CONTENT. LEONARD (about to tell her something) Honey? The sound of the SHOWER being run. Leonard opens his eyes and looks over to the bathroom door. LEONARD (cont'd) (relaxed) Honey? It's late. Leonard swings his legs over and sits on the edge of the bed. Move in on Leonard's face.

STEAM-FILLED BATHROOM ROOM 304 - NIGHT <SEQUENCE>> A BLONDE WOMAN in a silk dressing gown, seated on the toilet, looks up from SNORTING a line of cocaine off a small hand mirror. She GIGGLES as she speaks to Leonard. BLONDE Was it good for you? Leonard stands in the doorway, SHAKEN. The Blonde realizes that Leonard is not happy. (CONTINUED) 61. 107 CONTINUED: 107 BLONDE (cont'd) Shit. Was I supposed to lock the door? LEONARD No. That would have been worse. Leonard moves to turn off the shower.

DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304 - NIGHT - LATER <SEQUENCE>> Leonard, fully clothed, grabs a SHOPPING BAG from the closet, and does a quick circuit of the room, grabbing various items (the paperback book, hairbrush, alarm clock, stuffed toy) and STUFFING them into the bag. 109 EXT.

MOTEL ROOM 21 - NIGHT ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 110 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) dips the NEEDLE into the ink * reservoir and PUNCTURES the skin of his thigh, talking on the phone. LEONARD Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second. Leonard drops the needle/pen, pulls a LARGE FILE out of his sports bag and opens it on the bed. LEONARD (cont'd) The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house. The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it, along with some of his stuff. And I think there's something... (flips through pages) Something about a syringe... (flips pages, confused) I've got a copy of the police report.

LEONARD (cont'd) Yeah, and there's pages missing... I guess I've been trying to log them all. (listens, smiles) The police gave me the report themselves. I dealt with them a lot in my insurance job, and I had friends in the department. They must have figured that if I saw the facts of the case, then I would stop believing that we needed to find John G. Leonard flips to the back page to look at his HANDWRITTEN CONCLUSIONS. LEONARD (cont'd) They weren't even looking for John G. The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened, so they didn't chase any of it up. 111 EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY <> 111 Leonard pulls up in the Jaguar, checks the name against a NOTE written on a BEER MAT, and heads into the office.

DISCOUNT INN - ROOM 304 - DAY <> 112 Leonard enters the unoccupied room, flapping the Polaroid photo. He sifts through his sports bag, pulls out a pen and writes the motel's address on the picture. With well-practiced, efficient movements, Leonard removes his wall chart from the sports bag, unrolls it, sticks it to the wall. He takes a stack of Polaroids out of the sports bag and works through them, considering each new picture and finding its proper place on the chart like someone playing solitaire.

Leonard smiles, embarrassed. LEONARD (cont'd) No, you just go into the bathroom. We go to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then you go into the bathroom and slam the door. BLONDE Slam it? LEONARD Just loud enough to wake me up. BLONDE That's it? LEONARD That's it. Leonard gets up, pulls a paper shopping bag out of the closet and hands it to the Blonde. LEONARD (cont'd) But, first I need you to put these things around. The Blonde looks confused. LEONARD (cont'd) Just pretend these things are yours, and this is your bedroom. The Blonde pulls a bra out of the bag. (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 64. 112 CONTINUED: (3) 112 BLONDE Should I wear it? LEONARD No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something. BLONDE Whatever gets you off. The Blonde pulls the hairbrush out of the bag. She moves to brush her hair with it, but Leonard stops her. LEONARD No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's... you just have to put it where you would if it were yours. The Blonde sees the BLACK HAIR stuck in the brush. 113 INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - NIGHT <> 113 The lights are off. The Blonde and Leonard are lying side by side in bed. The Blonde checks to see that Leonard is asleep, then slips out of bed. She grabs her purse then opens the bathroom door. She looks back at Leonard, asleep.

MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQCTENCE## 114 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) TATTOOS HIMSELF as he talks on * the phone. So far he has tattooed: "FACT 5." LEONARD The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me. Leonard consults his FILE CARD, which says: "TATTOO: ACCESS TO DRUGS" LEONARD (cont'd) The police figure the guy was an addict needing money to score, but I'm not convinced. He's not gonna be breaking in when he's still got a stash that big. (MORE) (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 65. 114 CONTINUED: 114 LEONARD (cont'd) (listens) I think John G. left it or planted it. (listens) Well, it was a lot for one guy's personal use. (listens) How do you know that? (listens, checks report) Right, that's true. It fits. (listens) Too much for personal use, so he deals. Leonard takes his pen and alters his FILE CARD to read: "TATTOO: FACT 5. DRUG DEALER" Leonard picks up the NEEDLE/PEN and continues his tattoo. 115 EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - DAY <> 115 The CAR ALARM of the Jaguar is SOUNDING. Leonard exits, walks to the car and gets in, switching off the alarm. TEDDY (O.S.) You should lock a car as nice as this. Teddy is in the passenger seat. Leonard, startled, GRABS him by the throat. LEONARD Who the fuck are you? TEDDY (gasping) Teddy. Your buddy. LEONARD Prove it. TEDDY (gasping) Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy. Leonard lets him go. LEONARD What are you doing in my car? Teddy is now wearing his big grin, rubbing his neck. (CONTINUED) 66. 115 CONTINUED: 115 TEDDY Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you? LEONARD Unfinished business. TEDDY Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie. LEONARD Who's she? Teddy chuckles. TEDDY Whose house do you think you just walked out of? Leonard looks at the house. Teddy motions towards Leonard's pockets. TEDDY (cont'd) Take a look at your pictures, I bet you got one of her. Leonard pulls out his Polaroids and flips through them. He pauses at the one of Natalie. Teddy SWIPES it out of his hands to get a better look at the blurred image of Natalie turning in a doorway. TEDDY (cont'd) Great shot, Lenny. Teddy flips the photo over. There is nothing on the back. Teddy hands it back to Leonard. TEDDY (cont'd) You wanna make a note that you can't trust her. LEONARD Why's that? TEDDY Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 67. 115 CONTINUED: (2) 115 TEDDY (cont'd) You can't stay with her. Let me give you the name of a motel. Teddy starts looking for a piece of paper. TEDDY (cont'd) Good thing I found you. She's bad news. LEONARD What do you mean "bad news"? TEDDY She's involved with these drug dealers. Teddy opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finding a STACK OF BEER MATS from a local bar called FERDY'S. * TEDDY (cont'd) See these? That's the bar where she works. Her boyfriend's a drug dealer. She'd take orders for him, arrange meets. He'd write messages on these, then leave it on the bar. She'd drop replies when she served him drinks. LEONARD Why should I care? Teddy starts writing on the BEER MAT. TEDDY She's gonna use you. To protect herself. LEONARD From who? TEDDY Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you. LEONARD Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? TEDDY She couldn't. LEONARD Why not? (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 68. 115 CONTINUED: (3) 115 TEDDY (grins) She has no idea who I am. LEONARD Why are you following me? TEDDY I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her. Leonard takes out his pen, places the picture of Natalie face down on the dash and writes on the white strip on the back: "DON'T TRUST HER" LEONARD Happy now? TEDDY I won't be happy until you leave town. LEONARD Why? TEDDY How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions? LEONARD What sort of questions? TEDDY The sort of questions you should be asking yourself. LEONARD Like what? TEDDY Like how'd you get this car? That suit? LEONARD I have money. (CONTINUED) 69. 115 CONTINUED: (4) 115 TEDDY From what? LEONARD My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered. TEDDY So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? Leonard says nothing. Teddy laughs. TEDDY (cont'd) You haven't got a clue, have you? You don't even know who you are? LEONARD Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - TEDDY That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was. Teddy reaches out to Leonard's lapel, and gently opens his jacket to reveal the label. TEDDY (cont'd) Put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance? * Leonard looks down at his suit, then back to Teddy. LEONARD I didn't sell - TEDDY I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself. LEONARD Yeah, well, thanks for the advice. TEDDY Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 70. 115 CONTINUED: (5) 115 Teddy hands Leonard the BEER MAT and gets out of the car. TEDDY (cont'd) It's been fun, Lenny. Teddy walks off. Leonard pulls his Polaroids out of his pocket and finds the one of Teddy. He places it on the dash, face up, next to the one of Natalie which is still face down on the dash. Leonard reads the message he has written on the back of Natalie's picture: "DON'T TRUST HER" He flips Teddy's picture over, like a croupier turning a card at blackjack. On the back it says: "DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES" Leonard purses his lips in surprised frustration. He grabs his pen and scribbles on the back of Natalie's picture, obliterating the words: "DON'T TRUST HER" He flips Natalie's picture over and considers her blurred image. He looks up at her house, then picks up the BEER MAT, reading the address Teddy has given him. LEONARD Fuck it. I need my own place. Leonard starts the engine. 116 EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY <> 116 Leonard pulls up in his Jaguar, checks the name of the motel against the note written on the BEER MAT, then heads into the office to check in.

(MORE) (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 71. 117 CONTINUED: 117 LEONARD (cont'd) (listens) I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it?

LEONARD'S OFFICE - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 118 Leonard, in a CHEAP SUIT AND TIE, gets up from behind his desk to shake hands with Mrs. Jankis. They talk, Leonard nodding as he listens. Mrs. Jankis is crying. LEONARD (V.O.) She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back. The tearful Mrs. Jankis gives Leonard a determined look. MRS. JANKIS Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking - LEONARD Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - MRS. JANKIS I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy. LEONARD We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal. MRS. JANKIS I'm not appealing the decision. LEONARD Then why are you here? (CONTINUED) 72. 118 CONTINUED: 118 MRS. JANKIS Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I look into Sammy's eyes, I don't see some vegetable, I see the same old Sammy. What do you think it's like for me to suspect that he's imagining this whole * problem? That if I could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal? If I knew that my old Sammy was truly gone, then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy. * As long as I have doubt, I can't say goodbye and move on. LEONARD Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me? MRS. JANKIS I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition. Leonard plays with his letter opener, thinking. MRS. JANKIS (cont'd) I need to know what you honestly believe.

Natalie follows him, speaking into his ear. NATALIE (cont'd) No pens here, I'm afraid. You're never going to know that I called you a retard, and your wife a whore. Leonard turns to face her, barely controlling his anger. LEONARD Don't say another fucking word! NATALIE About your whore of a wife? Leonard slaps Natalie. She smiles, then speaks softly. NATALIE (cont'd) I read about your problem. You know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is? Leonard fumes. NATALIE (cont'd) Venereal disease.

It's not customary to take pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you wouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you got up to find out where she was. The guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what are you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why bother reading something that you won't remember? She's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing the news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck. But give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget. But you will forget-I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down when you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of yours, starts to remember? Never-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction. Maybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS disease. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember what happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about it. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a man in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember enough, don't you? You remember his face. This is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even know how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do you. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause. Sooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do, you'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help you. *** EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look at the room. It's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers. He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says, in crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A HOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW. Earl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a hospital-empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions. Two doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful, either-a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees, except for the evergreens, are bare-early spring or late fall, one or the other. Every inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads, neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window. Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud yellow letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID. Earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw. Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed YOUR SCHEDULE. It charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15. Given the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch: 10:30. He presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock. According to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs again and walks over to the bathroom. The bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he notices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns, extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one. The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste. The tap is of the push-button variety-a dose of water with each nudge. Earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with single-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The mouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is regular-sized. Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash. As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste, he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine cabinet. He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down. He closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the mirror. "Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?" The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths it against the mirror. It reads- IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD. Earl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it over. On the back it reads- P.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN. Earl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste. Maybe then he notices the scar. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's progress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the cigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins out of the bathroom. He is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two pictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught first by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's skull. In marker, the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares at it. Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big orbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain. Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle of his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck like a maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed, broken, but unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right there in the middle of his brain. He bends to look at the other picture. It is a photograph of a man holding flowers, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over, reading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over, looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl looks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he just stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep. The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again. Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles, interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. *** You can't have a normal life anymore. You must know that. How can you have a girlfriend if you can't remember her name? Can't have kids, not unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them. Sure as hell can't hold down a job. Not too many professions out there that value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, of course. No. Your life is over. You're a dead man.The only thing the doctors are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies. And they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be. So the question is not "to be or not to be," because you aren't. The question is whether you want to do something about it. Whether revenge matters to you. It does to most people. For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they take measures to get even. But the passage of time is all it takes to erode that initial impulse. Time is theft, isn't that what they say? And time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue. Conveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain distance. Time steals your nerve. If time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge, then there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We understand, but you're the better man for letting it go. For rising above it. For not sinking to their level. And besides, says authority, if you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room. But they already put you in a little room, didn't they? Only they don't really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a cripple. A corpse. A vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat or take a shit if someone wasn't there to remind you. And as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you anymore, does it? Just the same ten minutes, over and over again. So how can you forgive if you can't remember to forget? You probably were the type to let it go, weren't you? Before. But you're not the man you used to be. Not even half. You're a fraction; you're the ten-minute man. Of course, weakness is strong. It's the primary impulse. You'd probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry. Live in your finite collection of memories, carefully polishing each one. Half a life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic insects. You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you? Preserved in aspic. You'd like to but you can't, can you? You can't because of the last addition to your collection. The last thing you remember. His face. His face and your wife, looking to you for help. And maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over. Your little collection. They can lock you back up in another little room and you can live the rest of your life in the past. But only if you've got a little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him. You know I'm right. You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem impossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something out. But you don't have much time. You've only got about ten minutes, in fact. Then it starts all over again. So do something with the time you've got. *** EARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is ringing. It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window means it must be he early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost knocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room, painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread, too. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around him. It is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the window. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has his shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and crosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here and there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass. Earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at the two keys taped to the back of his hand. He picks at the tape while he searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his jacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in an envelope. He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom. Bits of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else. Earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and moves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the ceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT RIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU. Earl closes his eyes. *** They tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember? Back when your day planner was the back of your hand. And if your assignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done. No direction, they said. No discipline. So they tried to get you to write it all down somewhere more permanent. Of course, your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants wet if they could see you now. Because you've become the exact product of their organizational lessons. Because you can't even take a piss without consulting one of your lists. They were right. Lists are the only way out of this mess. Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots. This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick. But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic. The only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure that you control the idiots that you become. To take your chain gang, hand in hand, and lead them. The best way to do this is with a list. It's like a letter you write to yourself. A master plan, drafted by the guy who can see the light, made with steps simple enough for the rest of the idiots to understand. Follow steps one through one hundred. Repeat as necessary. Your problem is a little more acute, maybe, but fundamentally the same thing. It's like that computer thing, the Chinese room. You remember that? One guy sits in a little room, laying down cards with letters written on them in a language he doesn't understand, laying them down one letter at a time in a sequence according to someone else's instructions. The cards are supposed to spell out a joke in Chinese. The guy doesn't speak Chinese, of course. He just follows his instructions. There are some obvious differences in your situation, of course: You broke out of the room they had you in, so the whole enterprise has to be portable. And the guy giving the instructions-that's you, too, just an earlier version of you. And the joke you're telling, well, it's got a punch line. I just don't think anyone's going to find it very funny. So that's the idea. All you have to do is follow your instructions. Like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase. One step at a time. Right down the list. Simple. And the secret, of course, to any list is to keep it in a place where you're bound to see it. *** HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids. Insistent. He reaches out for the alarm clock, but he can't move his arm. Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him. The man looks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work. Earl looks around him. Too dark for a doctor's office. Then the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions. He squirms gain, trying to yank his forearm away, the one that feels like it's burning. The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him another scowl. Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the man's head. The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand-a gun with a needle where the barrel should be. The needle is digging into the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy letters behind it. Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the letters on his arm, but he can't. He lies back and stares at the ceiling. Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm with a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection. Maybe later he'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note. Maybe his wife will convince him to call the police. Earl looks down at the arm. The letters are rising up from the skin, weeping a little. They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch all the way to the inside of his elbow. Earl blinks at the message and reads it again. It says, in careful little capitals, I RAPED AND KILLED YOUR WIFE. *** It's your birthday today, so I got you a little present. I would have just bought you a beer, but who knows where that would have ended? So instead, I got you a bell. I think I may have had to pawn your watch to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway? You're probably asking yourself, Why a bell? In fact, I'm guessing you're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find it in your pocket. Too many of these letters now. Too many for you to dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little question. It's a joke, actually. A practical joke. But think of it this way: I'm not really laughing at you so much as with you. I'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and wonder, Why do I have this bell? a little part of you, a little piece of your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like I'm laughing now. Besides, you do know the answer. It was something you learned before. So if you think about it, you'll know. Back in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being buried alive. You remember now? Medical science not being quite what it is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a casket. So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing tubes. Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of oxygen. Now, they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to carry much noise. Not enough to attract attention, at least. So a string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone. If a dead person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his little bell till someone came and dug him up again. I'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food restaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and wondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it. Maybe you'll even ring it. Happy birthday, buddy. I don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so I don't know whether to congratulate you or me. A bit of a lifestyle change, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless. Look to yourself for the answer. That sounds like something out of a Hallmark card. I don't know when you thought it up, but my hat's off to you. Not that you know what the hell I'm talking about. But, honestly, a real brainstorm. After all, everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are. You're no different. *** THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself. It says, "The time is 8:00 a.m. This is a courtesy call." Earl opens his eyes and replaces the receiver. The phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner, and ends at the minibar. The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color nattering away at each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares. The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver fading increases. Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by what he sees. He is fully dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare in places. Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's gone. He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the skin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the first place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He stares at the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off anymore. He rolls up his sleeve. The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl reads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing under the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt. Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him. The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that occupies most of his chest. The face is that of a large man, balding, with a mustache and a goatee. It is a particular face, but like a police sketch it has a certain unreal quality. The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl, forward in the mirror. EventuallyEarl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, and begins to write. *** I don't know where you'll be when you read this. I'm not even sure if you'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to. It's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the song says, "By the time you read this note, I'll be gone." We're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put together, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you find him. Who knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if only you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't. I had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful. Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already passed us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had already come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives quietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the ones who failed the test, just keep on going, oblivious. Dead already, wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score, still optimistic about the future. I guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No expectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because nothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without worrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences. That's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room. Framed pictures of ships on the wall. I don't know, obviously, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I don't know what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a while. And, no, I don't know what happened to your watch. And all these keys: I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have we been up to? I wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the ten-minute man. Assassinated by a vegetable. I'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and then you can read this through if you want. I just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. No one who matters is left to say it. No one left is going to want to. EARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring through the window of the car. Smiling eyes. Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across the street. The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway. The body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain. *** A stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death, as in police sketches, faces tend to look the same. This is definitely somebody in particular. But really, it could be anybody. Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb. The car? Who's to say? Maybe it's a police cruiser. Maybe it's just a taxi. As the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine out into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a circle of concerned pedestrians. He chuckles to himself as the car continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd. Earl's smile fades a little. Something has occurred to him. He begins to pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for his keys, then a little more desperately. Maybe his progress is impeded by a set of handcuffs. He begins to empty the contents of his pockets out onto the seat next to him. Some money. A bunch of keys. Scraps of paper. A round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl seat. Earl is frantic now. He hammers at the plastic divider between him and the driver, begging the man for a pen. Perhaps the cabbie doesn't speak much English. Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of talking to suspects. Either way, the divider between the man in front and the man behind remains closed. A pen is not forthcoming. The car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He is calm now. The driver makes another corner, and the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a little jingle. He picks it up and looks at it, curious now. It is a little bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed on it are his name and a set of dates. He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was born. But the second date means nothing to him. Nothing at all. As he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on his wrist where his watch used to sit. There is a little arrow there, pointing up his arm. Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up his sleeve. *** "You'd be late for your own funeral," she'd say. Remember? The more I think about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story? And how would I know if I were late, anyway? I don't have a watch anymore. I don't know what we did with it. What the hell do you need a watch for, anyway? It was an antique. Deadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. The you that believed in time. No. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time as that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it, anyway? Who wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something powerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing. Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did unspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all wounds-which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us. But you're different. You're more perfect. Time is three things for most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment. This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost its ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft? But not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again. Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses. Time is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is this moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me. If this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying-and you have to keep trying-eventually you will come across the next item on your list. End.
FADE IN:

1    INT. DERELICT HOUSE - DAY <> 1 
A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a
crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a
decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should
be.

The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The
hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING
motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again
the picture is FANNED.

As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding
the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a
POLAROID CAMERA.

The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS.

The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy-
breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of
blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at
something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD
on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches
a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp.

Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the
floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts
the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth
should be.

Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his
face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself
into the face of TEDDY (40's, moustache) and we-

A late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and
approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING.
Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no
blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a
PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard
kills the engine, staring at the pickup.

				LEONARD
		Looks like somebody's home.

Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back.

				TEDDY
		That thing's been here for years.

Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He
inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows.

		I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't	*

Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the
interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds	*
six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.	*
He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.		*

Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets.
Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard.

Leonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He
pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and
leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him.

Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin
standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white
strip beneath the photo is handwritten:

"TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134"

Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back,
in the same small handwriting.

				TEDDY
		Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go,

Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried,
affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively,

				TEDDY (cont'd)
		Fuck this.

Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him,
pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts:

				LEONARD
		YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG
		FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY!

Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark  
house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of
the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD.

				TEDDY
		You don't have a clue, you freak.

Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels.

Leonard looks into the bag, then pulls out a can of SHAVING

"REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS"

He stares at the message for a second, thoughtful, then tries
to scrub the writing off his skin. To his surprise, it is
INDELIBLE. Leonard looks at it, quizzical, then notices some
markings on his wrist, pulling his sleeve back to get a
better look. He can read the start of a message:

Leonard is about to roll his sleeve up further when the
restroom door opens and a MAN enters. Leonard dries his
hands, then exits the rest room.

Leonard emerges .nto the waiting area of a crowded

21   INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - DAY <> 21 * 
Leonard enters, looks around as if for the first time. An
anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a
HAND-DRAWN CHART showing the layout of some streets, and
stuck to the edges of the chart are POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS,
with ARROWS DRAWN from each photograph to a spot on the map.

Leonard inspects the photos. Some are buildings, some are
people. All have the HANDWRITTEN NOTES on the broad white strip
underneath the image.

Leonard gets Polaroids out of his pocket. The first one is of
the Discount Inn. He STICKS it onto an already-squashed lump    *
of blue tack at the end of an ARROW drawn from a location on
the outskirts of town.

The second photo is a blurred shot of a Brunette turning in a
doorway. The name NATALIE is written under the picture.
Leonard flips it over. On the back are two handwritten
messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over,
but the other one reads:

"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

Leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. He steps
back looking over the Polaroids one by one: Natalie, Burt,
Discount Inn, Teddy.							    *

Leonard sits at the desk and opens the BROWN ENVELOPE. He
takes out a photocopy of a CAR REGISTRATION and a DRIVER'S
LICENSE. Both are in the name of JOHN EDWARD GAMMELL, but	  *
when Leonard looks at the picture on the license, he
recognizes the face. Leonard moves back to his wall chart,
finds the Polaroid of Teddy and compares it to the license
photo.

Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the

"THE FACTS:"

Leonard removes his jacket, then starts pulling off his shirt.

He has WRITING TATTOOED ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS.
MESSAGES in different styles of writing, some CRUDE, some
ELABORATE. The messages run in all directions, some UPSIDE-
DOWN, some BACKWARDS. Leonard examines his tattoos,
methodically. From Leonard's POV, the most striking is an
upside-down tattoo on his BELLY which says:

"PHOTOGPAPH: HOUSE, CAR, FRIEND, FOE"

On one FOREARM it says:

"THE FACTS:

FACT 1. MALE

FACT 2. WHITE"

On the other FOREARM:

Leonard takes out the REGISTRATION DOCUMENT and examines it.
Holding the photo of Teddy and the registration document,
Leonard checks off his TATTOOED FACTS:

Leonard drops the pen. Thinks. He looks at his chest through
the mirror and a backwards tattoo suddenly BECOMES CLEAR:

"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE"

Leonard buttons his blue shirt, then writes on the back of
Teddy's picture:

TURNS as Leonard pinches her thigh.

and hands him the BROWN ENVELOPE.

Sammy rolls a small GLASS BOTTLE between the palms of his

Sammy takes a SYRINGE and pushes the needle through the
rubber of the bottle. The label is marked "INSULIN".

		The crazy part was that this guy who

Sammy INVERTS the bottle and syringe, DRAWS the insulin into
the syringe, withdraws the needle, holds it up to check for
bubbles, TAPPING it delicately.

				LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D)
		... and as long as he kept his mind on

				LEONARD
		Memory's unreliable.

Teddy snorts.

				LEONARD (cont'd)
		No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's
		not even that good. Ask the police,
		eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The
		cops don't catch a killer by sitting
		around remembering stuff. They collect
		facts, make notes, draw conclusions.
		Facts, not memories: that's how you
		investigate. I know, it's what I used to
		do. Memory can change the shape of a room
		or the color of a car. It's an
		interpretation, not a record. Memories
		can be changed or distorted and they're
		irrelevant if you have the facts.

				TEDDY
		You really want to find this guy?

		So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But

		you learn stuff like riding a bike,
		things you don't think about, you just
		get better through practice. Call it
		muscle memory, whatever, but it's a

She tries to rip the picture. Leonard watches her try. The
plastic is too strong.

				LEONARD
		You have to burn them.

Natalie scrunches it up and throws it down. Leonard and
Natalie sit down on the couch.

				NATALIE
		You decided to help me. Trust yourself.
		Trust your own judgment. You can
		question everything, you can never know
		anything for sure.

				LEONARD
		There are things you know for sure.

				NATALIE
		Such as?

				LEONARD
		I know the feel of the world.
		    (reaches forward)
		I know how this wood will sound when I
		knock.
		    (raps knuckles on coffee table)
		I know how this glass will feel when I
		pick it up.
		    (handles glass)
		Certainties. You think it's knowledge,
		but it's a kind of memory, a kind you
		take for granted. I can remember so much.
		    (runs hands over objects)
		I know the feel of the world,
		    (beat)
		and I know her.

				NATALIE
		Your wife?

				LEONARD
		She's gone and the present is trivia,
		which I can scribble down as notes.

Natalie stares at Leonard, thinking.

Leonard takes his jacket off and places it on the back of the
couch, patting the pockets as he does so.

				LEONARD
		It's not easy to be calm when -

				NATALIE
		Just relax.

She reaches for his arm and unbuttons his cuff, revealing the
end of Leonard's tattoos.				 

				NATALIE (cont'd)
		You don't seem the type.

She pushes back the sleeve, trying to read the tattoo.
Leonard watches her.							    *

				NATALIE (cont'd)
		Come on.

She starts to unbutton his shirt. He watches. Natalie gasps
as she opens Leonard's shirt and pulls it back over his
shoulders. She tilts her head, trying to read the different
messages.

				NATALIE (cont'd)
		It's backwards.							    *							    

She pulls him up and turns him around in front of the mirror    *
to read the backwards tattoo across his chest.			   *

"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE".

Natalie touches the blank area of skin above Leonard's heart.   *

Leonard looks down at the blank patch, then at Natalie,	    *
vulnerable, confused.							   *

Natalie picks up a photograph from off a messy desk in the
corner. She shows it to Leonard. The picture shows Natalie
smiling and hugging a smirking YOUNG MAN (JIMMY). Natalie	  *
looks up at Leonard to see his reaction.

				NATALIE
		His name was Jimmy.

				LEONARD
		What happened?

				NATALIE
		He went to meet somebody and didn't come

Natalie studies Leonard.

				NATALIE
		A guy called Teddy.

Leonard does not react to the name.

Natalie puts the photo down. She reaches out to Leonard,	   *

Leonard bends his head around to see if Natalie is awake. She
closes her eyes. Leonard gingerly slides from underneath her
and moves silently out of the bedroom.

Leonard enters the dark room. He goes to the couch and picks
up his shirt and his jacket. He notices the photograph which

Leonard turns, looks over the rest of the room. He moves to the bureau and opens drawers. Empty. He goes to the closet and OPENS it. Inside is a BOUND and GAGGED MAN on the floor, knees against chest. His mouth is taped up with silver electrical tape, stained with DRIED BLOOD from his swollen nose. He looks up at Leonard, blinking in the sudden bright light, TERRIFIED. Leonard SHUTS the closet door, CONFUSED. The Man in the closet starts GRUNTING and BUMPING the closet door.

You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. Leonard thinks, then moves to the CLOSET and OPENS the door. Teddy looks in DISBELIEF at the Man in the closet. TEDDY (cont'd) Who the fuck is that? LEONARD You don't know him? TEDDY No! Should I? Leonard shrugs. TEDDY (cont'd) Is this John G.? LEONARD I don't think so. TEDDY Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down? LEONARD I might have fallen asleep before I did. Teddy shakes his head, chuckling. TEDDY Ask him.

Leonard replaces the gag and SHUTS the closet. TEDDY I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what - LEONARD No. No, just let me think for a minute. Leonard moves to the dresser and starts methodically emptying his pockets. He pulls a Polaroid out of his inside jacket pocket. LEONARD (cont'd) Here we go. The Polaroid shows Dodd sitting on the bed, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING. The name Dodd is written below the picture. Leonard flips it over.

Dodd is cleaned up and unbound, Leonard is pressed up right behind him. The three of them descend to the parking lot. LEONARD Which one? Dodd leads them to a new LANDCRUISER. Teddy whispers in Leonard's ear. TEDDY We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson. LEONARD Shut it, Teddy. TEDDY Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag. LEONARD I'll ride with him. You follow. TEDDY Give me your keys. Leonard looks at him, suspicious. LEONARD Take your own car. Teddy shrugs.

He notices the bottle in his hands as if for the first time. LEONARD (V.O.) Don't feel drunk. Leonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face, then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit. He puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then wearily UNDRESSES. Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR. Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING Dodd against the wall. Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the sink. Leonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD. Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over. Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE POCKET. 51. 77 INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <> 77 Leonard STUMBLES in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around, HITTING Dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle, which does not break. Dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his inside jacket pocket. Leonard stands above him, naked, dripping wet, catching his breath. There is a KNOCK at the door. FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Housekeeping. The sound of a KEY entering the lock. Leonard LEAPS for the door and flips the privacy latch. LEONARD Not just now! Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE. Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd. Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes "DODD" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing: "GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE" Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says: "DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6" * "PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE" Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket.

Leonard puts down the lighter and picks up a second BALL- POINT PEN. 80 EXT. DODD'S MOTEL - DAY <> 80 Leonard's Jaguar pulls up, FAST.

Leonard gets a CREDIT CARD out and slips it into the lock gently, with a practiced hand. He leaves the CARD WEDGED in the lock, then steps back from the door and KNOCKS. Leonard watches the POINT OF LIGHT in the PEEPHOLE to Room 9. The point of light GOES OUT. Leonard KICKS the door in, SMASHING THE ROOM'S OCCUPANT BACK INTO THE ROOM. Leonard stands over him, looking down. The man is unconscious, blood on his face. Something is not right. LEONARD (V.O.) Is this the guy? Leonard looks down at his NOTE. The room number given is 6. Leonard looks at the "9" on the door, then down at the unconscious man. LEONARD (cont'd) Fuck! Sorry. Leonard reaches down, GRABS his credit card from where it landed on the floor, and backs out of the doorway, shutting the door on the Unconscious Man. He MOVES QUICKLY to Room 6, slips his credit card in the lock and knocks. No answer, so Leonard slips inside. 81 INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <> 81 Leonard flicks the light on and glances around. There is nothing in the room except an empty VODKA BOTTLE on the bedside table. LEONARD (V.O.) Need a weapon.

(CONT'D) Chasing him! Leonard CUTS down the next gap between trailers, heading FULL SPEED for Dodd's side. Dodd (without bruises) appears again at the other end of the gap, SEES Leonard, and STARTS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM. There is a GUN in his hand. LEONARD (V.O.) (CONT'D) FUCK! He's chasing me. Leonard SKIDS to a halt and turns around. A BULLET hits the dirt by his feet. He clears the end of the trailer and THROWS himself over a chain link fence, dropping down on the other side and SCRAMBLING through some bushes. He RACES full tilt into a parking lot, looking around, desperate. He can hear a CAR ALARM sounding. He pulls his KEYS OUT and hits the ALARM switch. Hearing the DOUBLE BEEP as the alarm stops, he spots the Jaguar. The Jaguar PEELS OUT just as Dodd emerges from the trailer park. 85 INT. JAGUAR - DAY <> 85 Leonard is breathing hard, looking around nervously. He starts knocking BITS OF BROKEN WINDOW GLASS out of the driver's side window with his elbow then pulling photos and pieces of paper out of his pockets as he drives.

Dodd (without any bruises) is standing by the window, aiming his gun at Leonard. DODD I haven't made a strong enough impression. LEONARD (amused) Don't be too hard on yourself. Dodd motions for Leonard to open the passenger side door. Dodd gets into the passenger seat, gun on Leonard. Leonard nods to him. LEONARD Seat belt. Leonard starts to reach over his left shoulder with his right hand as if for the seat belt. Dodd watches Leonard's right hand. With his left hand, Leonard opens the door. He rolls out, SLAMMING the door in Dodd's face, and hitting the central locking on his car keys. Leonard TAKES OFF across the asphalt. Dodd tries the doors, then SHOOTS at Leonard, SHATTERING the driver's side window, triggering the CAR ALARM. Dodd climbs through the window and takes off after him. Leonard slips into a trailer park, TRIPPING as he DIVES into a gap between two trailers, STUMBLING over the PLASTIC LAWN FURNITURE and OLD BIKES which litter the narrow gap. He picks himself up and SPRINTS into the alley behind the trailers. He races along behind the trailers. Leonard is RUNNING FURIOUSLY, arms pumping. LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) What the fuck am I doing?

Leonard flicks through the pages. MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 57. 94 INT. BEDROOM, LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT <>94 Leonard is undressing. Leonard's Wife is in bed, reading the well-worn paperback. LEONARD How can you read that again? LEONARD'S WIFE (without looking up) It's good. LEONARD You've read it a hundred times. LEONARD'S WIFE I enjoy it. LEONARD Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next - LEONARD'S WIFE (looks up, annoyed) Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please. 95 EXT. RESERVOIR - NIGHT <> 95 He places the BOOK on the fire. He reaches into the bag, produces a BRA and a HAIRBRUSH. He puts the bra on the fire, then pulls some BLACK HAIR out of the hairbrush. He holds a few strands out above the fire until they shrivel up in the heat. He does this with a larger clump and it produces a SMALL FLAME so he DROPS it into the fire. LEONARD (V.O.) Probably tried this before. Probably burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't remember to forget you. He DROPS the brush onto the fire, pulls a GREEN ALARM CLOCK out of the bag and adds it to the fire. Once the bag is EMPTY, Leonard places it on the fire.

The Landcruiser follows. LEONARD (V.O.) He seems to know me. The Landcruiser PULLS ALONGSIDE the Jaguar. Leonard looks over. Dodd (no bruises) is at the wheel. Leonard rolls down his window. LEONARD (V.O.) What the fuck! Dodd pulls out a HASNDGUN and points it at Leonard. Leonard SLAMS on the brakes, JERKING to a halt as the Landcruiser pulls over in front of the Jaguar. 98 EXT. TRAILER PARK PARKING LOT - DAY <> 98 Dodd, gun in hand, gets out of the Landcruiser and approaches. DODD I like your car. LEONARD Thanks. DODD Where'd you get it? LEONARD Interested in buying one?

Leonard * pushes the ink-covered needle against his thigh, ABOUT TO BREAK THE SKIN. The PHONE RINGS, surprising Leonard.

MOTEL ROOM 304 - NIGHT <> 100 Leonard is WOKEN by the sound of a door SHUTTING FIRMLY. He turns his head to see a glow from under the bathroom door. In the dim light he can see a well-worn, COVERLESS PAPERBACK BOOK on the far bedside table. Next to it is a HAIRBRUSH and a drinking glass half-full of water. There is a small STUFFED TOY sitting by the pillow next to Leonard's head. Leonard's eyes are half-closed as he slides his hand onto the other half of the bed, feeling the residual warmth, smiling. He props himself up on one arm, rubs his eyes and reaches over to the SMALL, GREEN ALARM CLOCK, straining to read its numbers in the dim light. He breathes heavily, sleepily and shuts his eyes for a second, UTTERLY CONTENT. LEONARD (about to tell her something) Honey? The sound of the SHOWER being run. Leonard opens his eyes and looks over to the bathroom door. LEONARD (cont'd) (relaxed) Honey? It's late. Leonard swings his legs over and sits on the edge of the bed. Move in on Leonard's face.

STEAM-FILLED BATHROOM ROOM 304 - NIGHT <SEQUENCE>> A BLONDE WOMAN in a silk dressing gown, seated on the toilet, looks up from SNORTING a line of cocaine off a small hand mirror. She GIGGLES as she speaks to Leonard. BLONDE Was it good for you? Leonard stands in the doorway, SHAKEN. The Blonde realizes that Leonard is not happy. (CONTINUED) 61. 107 CONTINUED: 107 BLONDE (cont'd) Shit. Was I supposed to lock the door? LEONARD No. That would have been worse. Leonard moves to turn off the shower. LEONARD (cont'd) I'd like you to leave now. 108 INT. DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304 - NIGHT - LATER <SEQUENCE>> Leonard, fully clothed, grabs a SHOPPING BAG from the closet, and does a quick circuit of the room, grabbing various items (the paperback book, hairbrush, alarm clock, stuffed toy) and STUFFING them into the bag. 109 EXT. DISCOUNT INN - NIGHT <> 109 Leonard comes out of Room 304, grim-faced, carrying the shopping bag. He goes to his Jaguar and gets in. CUT TO: 110 INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - NIGHT ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 110 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) dips the NEEDLE into the ink * reservoir and PUNCTURES the skin of his thigh, talking on the phone. LEONARD Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second. Leonard drops the needle/pen, pulls a LARGE FILE out of his sports bag and opens it on the bed. LEONARD (cont'd) The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house. The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it, along with some of his stuff. And I think there's something... (flips through pages) Something about a syringe... (flips pages, confused) I've got a copy of the police report. (MORE) (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 61A. 110 CONTINUED: 110 LEONARD (cont'd) It has lots of information, but with my condition, it's tough. I can't really keep it all in mind at once.

LEONARD (cont'd) Yeah, and there's pages missing... I guess I've been trying to log them all. (listens, smiles) The police gave me the report themselves. I dealt with them a lot in my insurance job, and I had friends in the department. They must have figured that if I saw the facts of the case, then I would stop believing that we needed to find John G. Leonard flips to the back page to look at his HANDWRITTEN CONCLUSIONS. LEONARD (cont'd) They weren't even looking for John G. The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened, so they didn't chase any of it up. 111 EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY <> 111 Leonard pulls up in the Jaguar, checks the name against a NOTE written on a BEER MAT, and heads into the office. Leonard comes out of the office, gets a sports bag from the Jaguar, then takes a Polaroid of the entrance and heads for Room 304. 112 INT. DISCOUNT INN - ROOM 304 - DAY <> 112 Leonard enters the unoccupied room, flapping the Polaroid photo. He sifts through his sports bag, pulls out a pen and writes the motel's address on the picture. With well-practiced, efficient movements, Leonard removes his wall chart from the sports bag, unrolls it, sticks it to the wall. He takes a stack of Polaroids out of the sports bag and works through them, considering each new picture and finding its proper place on the chart like someone playing solitaire. LATER: (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 62A. 112 CONTINUED: 112 Leonard flips through the yellow pages, looking under "Escort Services". LATER: Leonard is on the phone.

LATER: The Blonde is looking curiously at the chart, drink in hand. Leonard is in the chair. BLONDE Well, what then? LEONARD It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. The Blonde turns, surprised. Leonard smiles, embarrassed. LEONARD (cont'd) No, you just go into the bathroom. We go to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then you go into the bathroom and slam the door. BLONDE Slam it? LEONARD Just loud enough to wake me up. BLONDE That's it? LEONARD That's it. Leonard gets up, pulls a paper shopping bag out of the closet and hands it to the Blonde. LEONARD (cont'd) But, first I need you to put these things around. The Blonde looks confused. LEONARD (cont'd) Just pretend these things are yours, and this is your bedroom. The Blonde pulls a bra out of the bag. (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 64. 112 CONTINUED: (3) 112 BLONDE Should I wear it? LEONARD No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something. BLONDE Whatever gets you off. The Blonde pulls the hairbrush out of the bag. She moves to brush her hair with it, but Leonard stops her. LEONARD No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's... you just have to put it where you would if it were yours. The Blonde sees the BLACK HAIR stuck in the brush. 113 INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - NIGHT <> 113 The lights are off. The Blonde and Leonard are lying side by side in bed. The Blonde checks to see that Leonard is asleep, then slips out of bed. She grabs her purse then opens the bathroom door. She looks back at Leonard, asleep. She moves into the bathroom and shuts the door firmly, making a LOUD BANG. Leonard's EYES OPEN. 114 INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQCTENCE## 114 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) TATTOOS HIMSELF as he talks on * the phone. So far he has tattooed: "FACT 5." LEONARD The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me. Leonard consults his FILE CARD, which says: "TATTOO: ACCESS TO DRUGS" LEONARD (cont'd) The police figure the guy was an addict needing money to score, but I'm not convinced. He's not gonna be breaking in when he's still got a stash that big. (MORE) (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 65. 114 CONTINUED: 114 LEONARD (cont'd) (listens) I think John G. left it or planted it. (listens) Well, it was a lot for one guy's personal use. (listens) How do you know that? (listens, checks report) Right, that's true. It fits. (listens) Too much for personal use, so he deals. Leonard takes his pen and alters his FILE CARD to read: "TATTOO: FACT 5. DRUG DEALER" Leonard picks up the NEEDLE/PEN and continues his tattoo. 115 EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - DAY <> 115 The CAR ALARM of the Jaguar is SOUNDING. Leonard exits, walks to the car and gets in, switching off the alarm. TEDDY (O.S.) You should lock a car as nice as this. Teddy is in the passenger seat. Leonard, startled, GRABS him by the throat. LEONARD Who the fuck are you? TEDDY (gasping) Teddy. Your buddy. LEONARD Prove it. TEDDY (gasping) Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy. Leonard lets him go. LEONARD What are you doing in my car? Teddy is now wearing his big grin, rubbing his neck. (CONTINUED) 66. 115 CONTINUED: 115 TEDDY Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you? LEONARD Unfinished business. TEDDY Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie. LEONARD Who's she? Teddy chuckles. TEDDY Whose house do you think you just walked out of? Leonard looks at the house. Teddy motions towards Leonard's pockets. TEDDY (cont'd) Take a look at your pictures, I bet you got one of her. Leonard pulls out his Polaroids and flips through them. He pauses at the one of Natalie. Teddy SWIPES it out of his hands to get a better look at the blurred image of Natalie turning in a doorway. TEDDY (cont'd) Great shot, Lenny. Teddy flips the photo over. There is nothing on the back. Teddy hands it back to Leonard. TEDDY (cont'd) You wanna make a note that you can't trust her. LEONARD Why's that? TEDDY Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 67. 115 CONTINUED: (2) 115 TEDDY (cont'd) You can't stay with her. Let me give you the name of a motel. Teddy starts looking for a piece of paper. TEDDY (cont'd) Good thing I found you. She's bad news. LEONARD What do you mean "bad news"? TEDDY She's involved with these drug dealers. Teddy opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finding a STACK OF BEER MATS from a local bar called FERDY'S. * TEDDY (cont'd) See these? That's the bar where she works. Her boyfriend's a drug dealer. She'd take orders for him, arrange meets. He'd write messages on these, then leave it on the bar. She'd drop replies when she served him drinks. LEONARD Why should I care? Teddy starts writing on the BEER MAT. TEDDY She's gonna use you. To protect herself. LEONARD From who? TEDDY Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you. LEONARD Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? TEDDY She couldn't. LEONARD Why not? (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 68. 115 CONTINUED: (3) 115 TEDDY (grins) She has no idea who I am. LEONARD Why are you following me? TEDDY I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her. Leonard takes out his pen, places the picture of Natalie face down on the dash and writes on the white strip on the back: "DON'T TRUST HER" LEONARD Happy now? TEDDY I won't be happy until you leave town. LEONARD Why? TEDDY How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions? LEONARD What sort of questions? TEDDY The sort of questions you should be asking yourself. LEONARD Like what? TEDDY Like how'd you get this car? That suit? LEONARD I have money. (CONTINUED) 69. 115 CONTINUED: (4) 115 TEDDY From what? LEONARD My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered. TEDDY So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? Leonard says nothing. Teddy laughs. TEDDY (cont'd) You haven't got a clue, have you? You don't even know who you are? LEONARD Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - TEDDY That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was. Teddy reaches out to Leonard's lapel, and gently opens his jacket to reveal the label. TEDDY (cont'd) Put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance? * Leonard looks down at his suit, then back to Teddy. LEONARD I didn't sell - TEDDY I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself. LEONARD Yeah, well, thanks for the advice. TEDDY Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 70. 115 CONTINUED: (5) 115 Teddy hands Leonard the BEER MAT and gets out of the car. TEDDY (cont'd) It's been fun, Lenny. Teddy walks off. Leonard pulls his Polaroids out of his pocket and finds the one of Teddy. He places it on the dash, face up, next to the one of Natalie which is still face down on the dash. Leonard reads the message he has written on the back of Natalie's picture: "DON'T TRUST HER" He flips Teddy's picture over, like a croupier turning a card at blackjack. On the back it says: "DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES" Leonard purses his lips in surprised frustration. He grabs his pen and scribbles on the back of Natalie's picture, obliterating the words: "DON'T TRUST HER" He flips Natalie's picture over and considers her blurred image. He looks up at her house, then picks up the BEER MAT, reading the address Teddy has given him. LEONARD Fuck it. I need my own place. Leonard starts the engine. 116 EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY <> 116 Leonard pulls up in his Jaguar, checks the name of the motel against the note written on the BEER MAT, then heads into the office to check in. Leonard comes out of the office, takes a Polaroid of the front of the motel, and heads for Room 304. 117 INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 117 Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) talks on the phone. He presses * the NEEDLE/PEN against his thigh, working on a "D". LEONARD I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously. This is a difficult condition for people to understand. I mean look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it. (MORE) (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 71. 117 CONTINUED: 117 LEONARD (cont'd) (listens) I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it? (listens) It got much worse than that. Eventually Sammy's wife came to see me at the office, and I found out all kinds of shit. (listens) She knew that I was the one who had built he case for Sammy faking it. 118 INT. LEONARD'S OFFICE - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 118 Leonard, in a CHEAP SUIT AND TIE, gets up from behind his desk to shake hands with Mrs. Jankis. They talk, Leonard nodding as he listens. Mrs. Jankis is crying. LEONARD (V.O.) She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back. The tearful Mrs. Jankis gives Leonard a determined look. MRS. JANKIS Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking - LEONARD Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - MRS. JANKIS I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy. LEONARD We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal. MRS. JANKIS I'm not appealing the decision. LEONARD Then why are you here? (CONTINUED) 72. 118 CONTINUED: 118 MRS. JANKIS Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I look into Sammy's eyes, I don't see some vegetable, I see the same old Sammy. What do you think it's like for me to suspect that he's imagining this whole * problem? That if I could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal? If I knew that my old Sammy was truly gone, then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy. * As long as I have doubt, I can't say goodbye and move on. LEONARD Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me? MRS. JANKIS I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition. Leonard plays with his letter opener, thinking. MRS. JANKIS (cont'd) I need to know what you honestly believe. LEONARD (looks at Mrs. Jankis) I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories. MRS. JANKIS Thank you. 119 INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 119 LEONARD She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.

Her eye is SWELLING UP, and her lip is SPLIT. NATALIE (cont'd) He beat the shit out of me. LEONARD Who? NATALIE Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.

He sits her down on the couch. LEONARD (cont'd) Let's get some ice on your face. LATER: Natalie, crying softly, holds a paper towel filled with ice cubes to her swollen cheek while Leonard gently uses a damp paper towel to wipe the blood from her upper lip. NATALIE I did exactly what you told me. I went to * Dodd and I said that I didn't have * Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything. LEONARD And what did he say? NATALIE He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me. LEONARD Where is he? NATALIE What are you gonna do?

Natalie gets a pen out of her purse and hands it to him. NATALIE He'll probably find you. LEONARD Me? Why would he be interested in me? NATALIE I told him about your car.

Natalie follows him, speaking into his ear. NATALIE (cont'd) No pens here, I'm afraid. You're never going to know that I called you a retard, and your wife a whore. Leonard turns to face her, barely controlling his anger. LEONARD Don't say another fucking word! NATALIE About your whore of a wife? Leonard slaps Natalie. She smiles, then speaks softly. NATALIE (cont'd) I read about your problem. You know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is? Leonard fumes. NATALIE (cont'd) Venereal disease. Maybe your cunt of a wife sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard. Leonard turns away, body tensed, ready to snap. Natalie reaches out to gently brush the hair above his ear with her fingers. NATALIE (cont'd) You sad freak, you won't remember any of what I've said, and we'll be best friends, or even lovers.

The flames go out, having destroyed the entire image but for an arm resting on a floor. Leonard sticks the remnants into his jacket pocket. He looks in the rear-view mirror at Teddy, who scrabbles around in the bushes. LEONARD (V.0.) (CON'T'D) ... but right now I need to be. Teddy's GREY SEDAN is parked in front of Leonard. Leonard looks at the sedan, then reaches into his sports bag for a PEN and a FILE CARD. He writes on the file card: "TATTOO: I'VE DONE IT" Leonard looks from the card to Teddy's sedan. LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) Maybe I'm not finished yet. Maybe I need to be sure that you won't ever use me again. Leonard rips up the file card and takes out another. LEONARD (V.0.)

ROLL CREDITS END. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The following is Jonathan Nolan's short story "Memento Mori", the inspiration for his brother, Christopher Nolan's, screenplay for the film, MEMENTO: MEMENTO MORI by Jonathan Nolan What like a bullet can undeceive!" -Herman Melville Your wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral. Remember that? Her little joke because you were such a slob-always late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident. Right about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers. You were there, you can be sure of that. That's what the picture's for-the one tacked to the wall by the door. It's not customary to take pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you wouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you got up to find out where she was. The guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what are you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why bother reading something that you won't remember? She's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing the news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck. But give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget. But you will forget-I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down when you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of yours, starts to remember? Never-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction. Maybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS disease. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember what happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about it. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a man in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember enough, don't you? You remember his face. This is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even know how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do you. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause. Sooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do, you'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help you. *** EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look at the room. It's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers. He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says, in crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A HOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW. Earl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a hospital-empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions. Two doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful, either-a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees, except for the evergreens, are bare-early spring or late fall, one or the other. Every inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads, neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window. Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud yellow letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID. Earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw. Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed YOUR SCHEDULE. It charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15. Given the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch: 10:30. He presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock. According to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs again and walks over to the bathroom. The bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he notices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns, extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one. The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste. The tap is of the push-button variety-a dose of water with each nudge. Earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with single-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The mouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is regular-sized. Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash. As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste, he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine cabinet. He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down. He closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the mirror. "Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?" The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths it against the mirror. It reads- IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD. Earl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it over. On the back it reads- P.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN. Earl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste. Maybe then he notices the scar. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's progress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the cigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins out of the bathroom. He is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two pictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught first by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's skull. In marker, the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares at it. Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big orbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain. Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle of his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck like a maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed, broken, but unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right there in the middle of his brain. He bends to look at the other picture. It is a photograph of a man holding flowers, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over, reading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over, looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl looks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he just stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep. The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again. Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles, interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. *** You can't have a normal life anymore. You must know that. How can you have a girlfriend if you can't remember her name? Can't have kids, not unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them. Sure as hell can't hold down a job. Not too many professions out there that value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, of course. No. Your life is over. You're a dead man.The only thing the doctors are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies. And they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be. So the question is not "to be or not to be," because you aren't. The question is whether you want to do something about it. Whether revenge matters to you. It does to most people. For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they take measures to get even. But the passage of time is all it takes to erode that initial impulse. Time is theft, isn't that what they say? And time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue. Conveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain distance. Time steals your nerve. If time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge, then there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We understand, but you're the better man for letting it go. For rising above it. For not sinking to their level. And besides, says authority, if you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room. But they already put you in a little room, didn't they? Only they don't really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a cripple. A corpse. A vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat or take a shit if someone wasn't there to remind you. And as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you anymore, does it? Just the same ten minutes, over and over again. So how can you forgive if you can't remember to forget? You probably were the type to let it go, weren't you? Before. But you're not the man you used to be. Not even half. You're a fraction; you're the ten-minute man. Of course, weakness is strong. It's the primary impulse. You'd probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry. Live in your finite collection of memories, carefully polishing each one. Half a life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic insects. You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you? Preserved in aspic. You'd like to but you can't, can you? You can't because of the last addition to your collection. The last thing you remember. His face. His face and your wife, looking to you for help. And maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over. Your little collection. They can lock you back up in another little room and you can live the rest of your life in the past. But only if you've got a little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him. You know I'm right. You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem impossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something out. But you don't have much time. You've only got about ten minutes, in fact. Then it starts all over again. So do something with the time you've got. *** EARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is ringing. It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window means it must be he early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost knocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room, painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread, too. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around him. It is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the window. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has his shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and crosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here and there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass. Earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at the two keys taped to the back of his hand. He picks at the tape while he searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his jacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in an envelope. He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom. Bits of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else. Earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and moves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the ceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT RIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU. Earl closes his eyes. *** They tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember? Back when your day planner was the back of your hand. And if your assignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done. No direction, they said. No discipline. So they tried to get you to write it all down somewhere more permanent. Of course, your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants wet if they could see you now. Because you've become the exact product of their organizational lessons. Because you can't even take a piss without consulting one of your lists. They were right. Lists are the only way out of this mess. Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots. This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick. But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic. The only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure that you control the idiots that you become. To take your chain gang, hand in hand, and lead them. The best way to do this is with a list. It's like a letter you write to yourself. A master plan, drafted by the guy who can see the light, made with steps simple enough for the rest of the idiots to understand. Follow steps one through one hundred. Repeat as necessary. Your problem is a little more acute, maybe, but fundamentally the same thing. It's like that computer thing, the Chinese room. You remember that? One guy sits in a little room, laying down cards with letters written on them in a language he doesn't understand, laying them down one letter at a time in a sequence according to someone else's instructions. The cards are supposed to spell out a joke in Chinese. The guy doesn't speak Chinese, of course. He just follows his instructions. There are some obvious differences in your situation, of course: You broke out of the room they had you in, so the whole enterprise has to be portable. And the guy giving the instructions-that's you, too, just an earlier version of you. And the joke you're telling, well, it's got a punch line. I just don't think anyone's going to find it very funny. So that's the idea. All you have to do is follow your instructions. Like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase. One step at a time. Right down the list. Simple. And the secret, of course, to any list is to keep it in a place where you're bound to see it. *** HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids. Insistent. He reaches out for the alarm clock, but he can't move his arm. Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him. The man looks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work. Earl looks around him. Too dark for a doctor's office. Then the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions. He squirms gain, trying to yank his forearm away, the one that feels like it's burning. The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him another scowl. Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the man's head. The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand-a gun with a needle where the barrel should be. The needle is digging into the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy letters behind it. Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the letters on his arm, but he can't. He lies back and stares at the ceiling. Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm with a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection. Maybe later he'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note. Maybe his wife will convince him to call the police. Earl looks down at the arm. The letters are rising up from the skin, weeping a little. They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch all the way to the inside of his elbow. Earl blinks at the message and reads it again. It says, in careful little capitals, I RAPED AND KILLED YOUR WIFE. *** It's your birthday today, so I got you a little present. I would have just bought you a beer, but who knows where that would have ended? So instead, I got you a bell. I think I may have had to pawn your watch to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway? You're probably asking yourself, Why a bell? In fact, I'm guessing you're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find it in your pocket. Too many of these letters now. Too many for you to dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little question. It's a joke, actually. A practical joke. But think of it this way: I'm not really laughing at you so much as with you. I'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and wonder, Why do I have this bell? a little part of you, a little piece of your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like I'm laughing now. Besides, you do know the answer. It was something you learned before. So if you think about it, you'll know. Back in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being buried alive. You remember now? Medical science not being quite what it is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a casket. So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing tubes. Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of oxygen. Now, they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to carry much noise. Not enough to attract attention, at least. So a string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone. If a dead person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his little bell till someone came and dug him up again. I'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food restaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and wondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it. Maybe you'll even ring it. Happy birthday, buddy. I don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so I don't know whether to congratulate you or me. A bit of a lifestyle change, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless. Look to yourself for the answer. That sounds like something out of a Hallmark card. I don't know when you thought it up, but my hat's off to you. Not that you know what the hell I'm talking about. But, honestly, a real brainstorm. After all, everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are. You're no different. *** THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself. It says, "The time is 8:00 a.m. This is a courtesy call." Earl opens his eyes and replaces the receiver. The phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner, and ends at the minibar. The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color nattering away at each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares. The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver fading increases. Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by what he sees. He is fully dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare in places. Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's gone. He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the skin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the first place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He stares at the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off anymore. He rolls up his sleeve. The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl reads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing under the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt. Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him. The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that occupies most of his chest. The face is that of a large man, balding, with a mustache and a goatee. It is a particular face, but like a police sketch it has a certain unreal quality. The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl, forward in the mirror. EventuallyEarl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, and begins to write. *** I don't know where you'll be when you read this. I'm not even sure if you'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to. It's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the song says, "By the time you read this note, I'll be gone." We're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put together, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you find him. Who knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if only you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't. I had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful. Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already passed us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had already come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives quietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the ones who failed the test, just keep on going, oblivious. Dead already, wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score, still optimistic about the future. I guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No expectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because nothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without worrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences. That's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room. Framed pictures of ships on the wall. I don't know, obviously, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I don't know what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a while. And, no, I don't know what happened to your watch. And all these keys: I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have we been up to? I wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the ten-minute man. Assassinated by a vegetable. I'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and then you can read this through if you want. I just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. No one who matters is left to say it. No one left is going to want to. EARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring through the window of the car. Smiling eyes. Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across the street. The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway. The body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain. *** A stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death, as in police sketches, faces tend to look the same. This is definitely somebody in particular. But really, it could be anybody. Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb. The car? Who's to say? Maybe it's a police cruiser. Maybe it's just a taxi. As the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine out into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a circle of concerned pedestrians. He chuckles to himself as the car continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd. Earl's smile fades a little. Something has occurred to him. He begins to pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for his keys, then a little more desperately. Maybe his progress is impeded by a set of handcuffs. He begins to empty the contents of his pockets out onto the seat next to him. Some money. A bunch of keys. Scraps of paper. A round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl seat. Earl is frantic now. He hammers at the plastic divider between him and the driver, begging the man for a pen. Perhaps the cabbie doesn't speak much English. Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of talking to suspects. Either way, the divider between the man in front and the man behind remains closed. A pen is not forthcoming. The car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the rearview mirror. He is calm now. The driver makes another corner, and the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a little jingle. He picks it up and looks at it, curious now. It is a little bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed on it are his name and a set of dates. He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was born. But the second date means nothing to him. Nothing at all. As he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on his wrist where his watch used to sit. There is a little arrow there, pointing up his arm. Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up his sleeve. *** "You'd be late for your own funeral," she'd say. Remember? The more I think about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story? And how would I know if I were late, anyway? I don't have a watch anymore. I don't know what we did with it. What the hell do you need a watch for, anyway? It was an antique. Deadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. The you that believed in time. No. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time as that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it, anyway? Who wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something powerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing. Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did unspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all wounds-which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us. But you're different. You're more perfect. Time is three things for most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment. This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost its ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft? But not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again. Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses. Time is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is this moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me. If this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying-and you have to keep trying-eventually you will come across the next item on your list. End.

   FADE IN:

   EXT. OCEAN - CLOSE UP:  WATER - MORNING LIGHT

   We are at the delicate interface between ocean and
   air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules
   evaporate.  This interchange is ethereal.  Then, low
   frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now...
   And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the
   ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots...

   OFFSHORE RACER:  "BORN TO WIN"

   in PROFILE.

   AERIAL:  "BORN TO WIN"

   ...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half
   mile.  It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes
   to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left...

   INT. RACE BOAT - SONNY CROCKETT

   pilots the "Born to Win" in full helmet.  On the throttle and
   flaps is RICARDO TUBBS...

   EXT. OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN"

   leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a
   couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.  At the last
   moment occurs a small power loss, and "Born to Win" gets
   nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, "Goddess"...

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. MARINA - "BORN TO WIN" - LATER

   thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.  The canopy
   is up.  Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.  Dockhands tie
   it off.  It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine-
   figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German
   princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions
   about asset origins.  The exception is "Born to Win's"
   sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK.  He
   looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.  Next
   to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.  We'll
   see her again.

   WINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of
   "Goddess," neither of whom speak English.  The #3 boat,
   "Bicardi Silver," was driven by David Scott and throttled by
   John Tomlinson...

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican
   billionaires.  As the small crowd breaks up...

   A DEEPLY-TANNED PLAYER

   named NICHOLAS in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair
   glides by...

                        NICHOLAS
                  (low)
             Burnett, what's crackin'?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.

                        TUBBS
             Maxin' and relaxin'.

                        NICHOLAS
                  (doesn't believe them)
             Sure.  Change your mind; get
             inclined?  Let me know...

   Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't
   want.  (Nicholas brokers "go-fast" runs, moving loads from
   offshore into South Florida.  Among guys who pilot offshore
   race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but
   no one's found them yet.)  Meanwhile...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHT

   A couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel.
   Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss.
   Fan starts.  Beyond the kitchen we SEE through a dining room
   to a den.  A chair is overturned.  We HEAR muffled sounds.
   We SEE feet extend through a door jamb.  Someone's on the
   floor.  A television is playing, distantly.

   INT. DEN - SEE FAMILY PICTURES

   so close they almost come to life.  A Venezuelan family, two
   boys and a girl in a pool.  Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at
   their sister's baptism.  And we see holding the baby daughter
   is Riccardo Tubbs.

   A family dinner at a South American restaurant.  Tubbs sits
   with the youngest daughter on his lap.  Maria is on the other
   side of him.  This is the image that almost comes to life.
   We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday
   afternoon when families take the grandparents and have
   dinner.

   INT. KITCHEN - SUB ZERO REFRIGERATOR

   MOVE from the bright glare of the interior ONTO

   the broad neck of a MAN.  A Viking is tattooed there.  The
   image morphs into a naked woman presenting her rear to a
   muscled biker next to a chopper above a swastika residing
   between shoulder blades.  SS lightning bolts are on his neck.
   PULL BACK from this MAN, who is bent into the frig because
   he's hungry.  His head is shaved and he's naked from the
   waist up.  A BLACK HEFTY GARBAGE BAG is tied around his
   waist.  Yellow industrial gloves are on his hands.  Something
   bad is happening in this house...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

   It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on
   a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.

   RICARDO TUBBS

   pilots the chopper past the brightly lit windows of high-rise
   Collins Avenue condos for the fugitive rich...and heads
   towards the MacArthur Causeway.

                        CROCKETT
             What's our deal?

                        TUBBS
             Backup in case the Russians get
             physical.

                        CROCKETT
             How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?

                        TUBBS
             Skin has to touch skin.  That's the
             requirement for the warrant.  Then
             he makes a credible excuse and he                        
             stops....
                  (beat)
             Her crew blackmailed and asset-
             stripped the last mark down to his
             social security...                                       

   In the back - her long copper legs stretched out under a
   short skirt - is GINA CALABRESE.

                        GINA
             This I gotta see...
                  (beat)
             ...the "make up an excuse and stop"
             part.

                        CROCKETT
             Have faith.

                        GINA
             I have faith.  In horoscopes and
             fortune cookies...

                        TUBBS
             So?

                        GINA
             Switek pulling this off...?  That's
             not faith; that's delusional...

   Wearing enough of nothing to hide the micro .380, which Gina
   checks right now.  There's a round in the chamber.

   AERIAL:  THE SIKORSKI crosses past the stacks of $5 million
   condos to a landing pad on a roof.  The Miami of the '80's,
   that twilight-zone frontier built on coke-fueled cash flow,
   is over.  The frontier development stage is passed.  It has
   BECOME Casablanca.  Anything goes; everything has a price.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. ROOFTOP LANDING PAD - WIDE

   The chopper rockets in, settles.

   INT. UTILITY STAIRCASE

   Crockett, Tubbs and Gina descend to the 25th-floor penthouse,
   the target.  As Crockett and Tubbs continue down to 24, she
   looks over her shoulder at Tubbs...

                        TUBBS
             Damn, girl...

   INT. SURVEILLANCE APARTMENT (ONE FLOOR BELOW THE TARGET)
   PENTHOUSE - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   enter.  Two surveillance technicians, RICK and FRANK, are
   glued to a monitor showing a bedroom in which nothing
   happens.  LT. CASTILLO is there, out of a past somewhere
   between CIA and the Jesuits...

   Referring to the monitor on which there are NO PEOPLE in an
   EMPTY BEDROOM.

   They are watching air move.

                        TUBBS
             This is exciting...

                        RICK
             That's 'cause nothing is happening.

                        CROCKETT
             No shit...?

                        FRANK
                  (it goes past him)
             Yeah.  This is their
             surveillance...how they video their
             marks?  See, we jacked their fiber
             optics, like we piggybacked their
             signal.  Get it?

                        TUBBS
             Cooool...

   They exit to...

   INT. PENTHOUSE CONDO - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   are met at the door by security, who recognizes them, and are
   welcomed by their host, UGO.  This is the Baccardi Cup After-
   Party.  The same players from the marina...

   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS

   enter an 8,000-square-foot penthouse...offshore racer types,
   players, So Bee models...

                        UGO
             Runnin' the Biscayne 200?

   Crockett wanders off...

                        TUBBS
             If a coupla new exhaust manifolds
             show up...

   CROCKETT

   approaches a bar and female bartender...

                        CROCKETT
             Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or
             Boodles.

                        BARTENDER
                  (Scandinavian accent)
             Lemon or lime?

                        CROCKETT
             Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics,
             darlin'.  Where ya' from?

                        BARTENDER
                  (leaning in)
             Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.

                        CROCKETT
             You in Miami workin' on your
             complexion...?

   She's beautifully bronzed.

                        BARTENDER
                  (laughs)
             No.  I was in Namibia...

                        CROCKETT
             Doing...?

                        BARTENDER
             With the United Nations High
             Commission on Refugees.  Famine
             relief.

   Gina's listening on her personal comms.

                        CROCKETT
             Really?  I did refugee relocation
             in Somalia.  But they transferred
             me out after I was wounded...

   Gina rolls her eyes as she crosses by Tubbs.

                        GINA
             Only African he ever "relocated"
             was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model
             for Gucci, and he got wounded when
             she took an NBA draft choice to the
             Super Bowl instead of him...

                        TUBBS
             He did volunteer one time...

                        TRUDY
                  (entering)
             For a massage parlor bust?
                  (beat)
             Why am I here...?

   TRUDY JOPLIN is a tall African-American.  She whispers into a
   small mic.  If you looked closely, she's ripped...as if steel
   cables moved under her smooth skin.  She slides past Tubbs
   and Gina...

                        TUBBS
                  (low)
             ...to backup Switek.  But only if
             it gets lethal.

                        TRUDY
             That's impossible.

                        TUBBS
             Why?

                        TRUDY
             Because you cannot kill him.

   SWITEK

   all white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed,
   adrenaline junkie partner, ZITO.  Approaching is "Miss
   Ukraine."  High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's
   horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek
   finds her...

   Tubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is
   unusually fit.

                        TUBBS
             And there's Dmitri...

                        CROCKETT
             The honey trap.  And there's the
             honey.

                        TUBBS
             Hello, Miss Ukraine...

   MISS UKRAINE brings Switek his glass of champagne...  She
   whispers something in his ear...and is led towards a back
   bedroom.  Gina ambles over.

                        TRUDY
                  (to Crockett)
             Eleven to seven he blows it.

                        CROCKETT
                  (whispers)
             Twenty on my man...

                        TRUDY
             You're giving away your money,
             fool...

   Tubbs opens his Moto as if he's about to make a call...Trudy
   looks over his shoulder.  What we see is the feed from the
   monitor in the surveillance room downstairs.

   CLOSER: TUBBS'S MOTO

   Two blonde people starting to get naked.  Switek and Miss
   Ukraine.  A second call comes in.  Tubbs ignores it.

                        TUBBS
                  (to Zito)
             You bet your partner?

                        ZITO
             Sure.  Switek versus primal impulse
             from the amygdala.  Higher thinking
             versus the lizard brain.  Tectonic
             plates of libido confront the
             cognitive.

                        GINA
             Oh, bullshit.  She cops his joint.
             He pushes the button.

                        TRUDY
             What's so fucking difficult?

   THEIR FACES.  They watch.  And...Crockett's cell phone rings.
   He separates from the group...

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah...?

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             Sonny...?

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             Where's Riccardo?

                        CROCKETT
             On the phone.

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...

   EXT. BALCONY - CROCKETT - NIGHT

   enters.  He's come outside to hear better.

   In the background Gina shakes her head about Switek.  He blew
   it.  Trudy looks at Crockett and sees Crockett's focused,
   hearing...

                        CROCKETT
             Who is this?

                                                  INTERCUT
                                                  WITH:

   INT. BENTLEY - ALONZO STEVENS - NIGHT

   He's cruising at 85.  He's floating in a magnolia leather
   interior.  But it's bloodstained from his nose and mouth.
   He's been beaten.  His white shirt is torn.  He doesn't
   care...

                        STEVENS
                  (voice cracks)
             It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...

                        CROCKETT
                  (recognizing him)
             Alonzo?
                  (beat)
             What are you talking about?  Where
             are you...?

                        STEVENS
             They had me from the gate.

                        CROCKETT
             I don't understand...

   Crockett's alarmed.  He catches Tubbs' eye and waves him
   outside...

                        STEVENS
             I gave up nothing on you guys.
             Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico
             out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're
             on their own...it's all their deal,
             anyway, so fuck 'em.

                        CROCKETT (O.S.)
             Alonzo, what's goin' on?!

                        STEVENS
             After I check on Francine and the
             boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell
             Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to
             know...

   Tubbs joins Crockett on the balcony.

                        CROCKETT
             Where are you?

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             ...look after her.  Ask Rico to.
             Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do
             it.  They had me from the gate.
             Do that.  Whatever you can do for
             them.  Okay?
                  (breaks)
             Look what I did to them, Sonny...!

                        CROCKETT
             Alonzo...!

                        STEVENS (O.S.)
             Goodbye.

   Crockett's phone goes dead.

                        TUBBS
             What is it?

                        CROCKETT
             Alonzo...

                        TUBBS
             Stevens?

                        CROCKETT
                  (nods)
             Something's wrong.

   Crockett's entering a number while...

                        TUBBS
                  (dialing)
             I'll try Francine...

   Meanwhile Crockett HEARS...

                        MACHINE VOICE
                  (recording)
             Federal Bureau of Investigation.
             Our office hours are...
                  (Crockett punches three-
                   digit code)

                        FBI AGENT VOICE
             F.B.I....

                        CROCKETT
                  (cuts him off)
             This is Detective Crockett.  Miami-
             Dade P.D.  Patch me through to your
             Special Agent in Charge, James
             Fujima?  It's an emergency...

                        FBI AGENT
             He'll be in on Monday...

                        CROCKETT
             I said, "emergency."  If he's not
             reachable, who's running the
             weekend?  The ASAC?

                        FBI AGENT
             We don't give that out...

                        CROCKETT
             Listen carefully.

   Crockett compels himself to be patient.  Meanwhile, Tubbs has
   struck out with Alonzo's home phone.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
                  (into Nextel)
             An informant who is working one of
             YOUR cases right now called me.
             YOU may have a problem.  So get me
             somebody on the other end of this
             telephone who knows what the hell
             I'm talking about...!

   Meanwhile...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             C'mon...

                        VOICE (O.S.)
             Miami-Dade PD Tech...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Bobby G.  The firefly we used to
             have on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley,
             check if it still runs; if so,
             launch Air Support.  Locate the
             Bentley...
                  (pause, listens)
             I don't know...we haven't worked
             with him for six months...

                        CROCKETT
                  (waits, then hears a click
                   on his Nextel)
             Hello?

                        FUJIMA (O.S.)
             This is Agent James Fujima.

                        CROCKETT
             Detective Crockett.

                        FUJIMA (O.S.)
             What's your Miami PD badge number?

                        CROCKETT
             4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.

                        FUJIMA (O.S.)
                  (pause)
             Okay.  What's up?

                        CROCKETT
             A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint
             Interagency Task Force.  Name of
             Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR
             informant.  Stevens, called us.  I
             haven't spoken to him for six
             months.
             I do not know what case you have
             him on.  I do not know what he is
             talking about.  But whatever he is
             doing for you, it sounds like it is
             going bad.  Right now...

                        FUJIMA
             How do I discuss operations over an
             open line?

                        CROCKETT
             How do I know?
                  (beat)
             I got the call from Alonzo on an
             open line.  That is the hand we
             have been dealt at this moment, at
             eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday
             night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert
             you, here.
                  (beat)
             You know whether or not...you have
             a thing goin' down.  I do not.
                  (beat)
             But we know this guy.  I think you
             know this guy.  Normally, he is
             cool.  Tonight he is distraught.
             That is atypical.  That engenders
             foreboding.  Do you understand the
             meaning of the word "foreboding"?
             As in badness is happening to your
             deal right fucking now?

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. ABANDONED METAL SHED, INDIAN RIVER - WIDE - NIGHT

   Nothing.  Rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into
   weeds next on a channel of the Indian River.  It cuts through
   inner-city Miami.  Distant noise.  But...

   INT. METAL SHED - ARYAN BROTHERS

   in low light are strapping up.  Kevlar vests go over tattooed
   arms and chests.  Glimpses of swastikas.  Handguns in
   waistbands.  SMGs (Small Machine Guns) slung from shoulders
   over white shirts, business-suit jackets.  Everybody wears
   surgical gloves.  Shoes are industrial.

   REAR SHOT:  TWO OF THE BROTHERS

   are leaving.  One carries a very long rifle with a flash
   suppressor.  It is a bolt action .50 caliber Burrows.

   NEARBY ON THE RIVER

   is a second Aryan Brother sniper team with an identical
   weapon aimed at an empty lot a thousand yards away across the
   Indian River...

   INT. METAL SHED

   Two Suburbans and an Escalade pull out...

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. INDIAN RIVER - EMPTY LOT

   Caribbean freighters seized by US Customs rust at the bank.
   MOVE IN.  Two Cadillacs are parked.  Waiting.  A door opens.
   An interior light comes on.  MOVE CLOSER.  Two Russian
   slickster types.  Patient.  One looks at a watch.  The other
   triggers his cell phone.  A meeting is imminent.

                                                  MEANWHILE:

   INT. FBI OFFICE - RAC JAMES FUJIMA - NIGHT

   Empty except for the FBI Agent in a sweatsuit carrying files,
   as if he stopped by when Crockett's call came in.  He's on a
   computer.  He picks up the phone...

                        FUJIMA
             Guy's involved in a "meet"...

                        CROCKETT
             "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"?
             "Reverse undercover"?  What?

                        FUJIMA
             Meet and greet.  "I flash you some
             of mine, you flash me some of
             yours?"

                        CROCKETT
             And the deal goes down at another
             place at another time.

                        FUJIMA
             That's right.

                        CROCKETT
             ...so there's no industrial-
             strength HRT weapons team out there
             tonight?

   Crockett puts his Nextel on "speaker" so Tubbs can hear, too.

                        FUJIMA
             Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash
             cash.

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Haitian, Dominican, Russian,

             everything he said.

                        CROCKETT
             He is saying they had him from the
             gate.  He is saying to my partner
             and I and to his family "goodbye."
             What does that tell you?

   EXT. INDIAN RIVER - WIDE:  THE DEAL - NIGHT

   Three Aryan Brothers in business suits get out of the rear of
   the Escalade and Suburban with a driver in each.  Our two
   "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup
   Cadillac and one driver on the other side.

   CLOSER:  ARYAN BROTHERS.  Friendly.  Hip-hop culture has
   invaded White Supremacist gangs.  Buzz cuts.  Goatees.  A
   couple of diamond earrings.

                        RUSSIAN #1
             ...sample now is okay.  And we want
             sample load when we do deal...

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Sure, man.

                        RUSSIAN #1
             What inventory you can supply...?

                        ARYAN BROTHER #1
             Meth.  Glass, ice, K's, E's,
             Mitsu's, Ames, Ex...whatever you
             need.  Coke?  Tonnage.  And
             Colombian H.  But give us a heads
             up...

   The Aryan Brother pops him a couple of vials.

                        ARYAN BROTHER #1 (cont'd)
             Ice.  Spectra-analyze that shit.
             And party-on with the coke.  You
             are looking at ninety-two percent
             pure...none of that jumped-on
             powder they sell up in New

             Yeah...
                  (beat)
             Now, let's see the green...

   One of the Russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other
   opens up a Nike sports bag.

                        RUSSIAN
             Never seen money before?  This is
             called "money."

   Aryan Brother #1 reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks
   of hundreds.  Flips through a couple, takes one or two at
   random.  Russian nods for him to go ahead.

                        ARYAN BROTHER #1
             Okay.  You got lotsa green.  We got
             all the goodies.  We party.
             Larry'll call you in the AM and
             talk money, quantity, time and
             place...

   WIDEN.  Everybody goes back to their cars.  As the two
   "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the
   running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Hey, Ivan!  I forgot to ask you
             something, my brother...

   He looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a
   Nextel.

                        ARYAN BROTHER (cont'd)
             ...they have a decent death-benefit
             program in the FBI?

   For the Russians in the car, time freezes.  As they start
   to react, they're blown up by .50 caliber rounds from the two
   sniper positions.  The .50 caliber rounds go right through
   car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh,
   bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end.
   Another round goes through the passenger door, through the
   passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into
   the night...

   WIDE

   The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the
   chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash.  The
   Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles.  They load up and
   drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and
   some distant sirens.  Meanwhile...

   INT. MIAMI-DADE CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO - NIGHT

   at 170 knots watching a thermographic image of Alonzo
   Stevens' car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on
   the 95...  SEE Tubbs' Sikorsky beyond Switek + Zito as it
   swoops from a higher altitude right past the Miami-Dade
   chopper, banks and dives for the freeway.

   EXT. FREEWAY

   Tracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front.

   The black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood.  Tubbs
   racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in
   the copilot seat...

   CLOSER:  CROCKETT

   has his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the
   shoulder.  Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's
   Bentley.  Alonzo pulls over.  Tubbs wheels around and lands
   on the shoulder.  They approach...

   ALONZO STEVENS

   exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs.  He
   holds his hand out to keep them at a distance.

   Freeway traffic roars past.  Crockett and Tubbs don't get too
   close, heeding Alonzo's warning...

                        TUBBS
                  (incensed, over traffic
                   noise)
             What the hell did you do?

                        STEVENS
             The Feeb gig was I front a coupla
             undercover, Russian-speakers to
             them.  One's ATF.  And broker the
             deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR
             types...

   Stevens takes a low-resolution E-mailed image from his pocket
   and hands it to Tubbs.  Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to
   Crockett.  Stevens' head rotates loosely on his
   shoulders...his mind's elsewhere...



   CROCKETT'S POV:  IMAGE

   Alonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair
   in a TV room.  On the floor are two young boys bound with
   plastic ties.  Paper bags are over their heads.  Francine's
   eyes are as large as saucers.  Around her neck is a necklace
   of C-4 explosive connected to a detonator.

                        STEVENS (cont'd)
                  (shouts)
             So I gave them up, man!  Gave up
             the Feds!  Gave up everything
             I knew.  Now I got to go home...

                        CROCKETT
             How'd they get onto you?

                        STEVENS
             How do I know?  But it was from the
             get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me
             into them.

             Sonny, I gotta go...!

   INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - TRUDY - NIGHT

   and a Miami PD SWAT team crash through the front door.
   Another team through the back.  Trudy in a tactical vest is
   second in with a 12-gauge.  The house is empty.  Gina and
   other detectives hang in the rear.  First SWAT team "clears"
   the living room, dining room.  Second clears the kitchen,
   maid's quarters...

   INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - DOOR TO DEN - NIGHT

   ...last room to clear...center of the house.  SWAT teams
   appear around corners.  Weapons up.  The looks on their faces
   tell us nobody is here...nobody alive...and what they see
   gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the
   legs of a family and overturned chairs.  Alonzo didn't save
   anyone.

                        TRUDY
                  (after changing channel)
             Hello, Sonny...?

   EXT. FREEWAY - TUBBS

   on police radio listens to a message from Trudy while...

                        STEVENS
                  (to Tubbs)
             I gotta, I gotta go...!

                        TUBBS
             Alonzo...

                        STEVENS
             What...?

                        TUBBS
                  (voice cracks)
             Alonzo, you don't need to go home.

   Now Alonzo knows.

                        STEVENS
             They said they wouldn't hurt them,
             wouldn't hurt them if...

                        TUBBS
             They lied.

                        CROCKETT
             They been known to do that...

   Alonzo Stevens has a strange look in his eyes.  He looks at
   Crockett and Tubbs, as if to say something.  He doesn't.
   Crockett and Tubbs walk towards him, to reach him...to
   console him...

   BUT ALONZO STEVENS

   backs away.  Looks at them sadly.  And before they can stop
   him, he steps out onto the freeway, opens his arms, and
   embraces the front bumper of a 70 m.p.h. 18-wheeler.

   INT. MERCEDES CL-500 - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   Grim, silent, race through Miami traffic to the crime scene

   emergency vehicles a quarter mile ahead.  Death is not
   procedural or casual, not when it's somebody you know, like
   an informant you worked cases with.  Cell phone rings.

             Alonzo only fronted as a broker for
             our guys to make the meet.  He
             wasn't deep into the crew.

                        CROCKETT

             busted back...

                        FUJIMA
             Not anymore.  This is a distribution
             network out of South Florida,
             moving poly-drug loads, crystal
             meth through coke, to Nashville,
             Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And
             computer fraud, identity theft.
             It's like that.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to the point)
             Tell them what you want.

                        FUJIMA
             They knew about Alonzo, before he
             made a move on them.  They had our
             operation.  They've cut into us.

                        CROCKETT
             How?

                        FUJIMA
             We don't know.

             Break your encryption?  Hack your e-
             mail?  Employee databases?
             Somebody on the inside?

                        FUJIMA
             We don't know.  And that's the
             point.  Maybe there's a mole.
             Whatever, it's a disaster.  And	
             it's a Joint Interagency Task
             Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S.
             Customs components in on it.  So
             the penetration could be from any
             one agency.  What we do know is I
             have to suspend operations right
             now from undercover work through
             interdictions 'cause I have to
             assume our Operational Security is
             blown.

                        TUBBS
             As in, your ass is dead in the
             water.

                        FUJIMA
             But Miami PD wasn't part of the
             J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said,
             he didn't give you up.

                        CROCKETT
             So what do you want?

                        FUJIMA
             To recruit you.

   Pause.

             ...I didn't want you around the

             don't know who's straight up, who's
             not...

                        CROCKETT
             Recruit us to do what?

                        FUJIMA
             Get into business with this crew,
             identify them.  Illuminate their
             network.  If you're lucky, discover
             their source, how they penetrated
             us.  We'll indict and take it from
             there...

                        CROCKETT
             How do we do that?  Make a buy?
                  (wry)
             That went well...

                        TUBBS
             Reverse undercover?  WE supply to
             them?

                        FUJIMA
             They got a steady stream of supply.
             So, no...

                        CROCKETT
             From whom...?

                        FUJIMA
             A Colombian producer.  Named
             Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.

                        CROCKETT
             Never heard of him.

                        FUJIMA
             From the North Valle area.  New.
             Low-level, we think.

                        TUBBS
             Aryan brothers are not going to
             change-up suppliers.  So...

                        CROCKETT
             Transpo?  How they bringing the
             loads in...?

                        FUJIMA
             They're not.  They collect in
             Miami.  Montoya, the producer,
             handles deliveries.  That's his
             end, and he varies the routes.  We
             got some FLIR off an AWAC of a
             coupla go-fast boats, on one run,
             that's all.

   Fujima boots up his military-spec laptop to view the FLIR
   video.  Meanwhile...

                        TUBBS
             Track with me, here...
                  (beat)
             They knew the "Russians" were
             undercover Feeb?  They should have
             no-showed.  But, no, these guys
             show anyway, and commit murder upon
             federal officers.  And steal all
             your money...
                  (beat; to Fujima)
             What does that say to you?

                        CROCKETT
                  (speculating)
             It says, "We do not fear you."
                  (to Fujima)
             It says, "Fuck off and die."  It
             says, "We get down for
             recreation..."

   Fujima's Dell laptop glows to life.  Two almost
   indistinguishable boats and their wakes are SEEN.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             Blow that up...

   Crockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots
   about the wake emerging behind each boat.  He exchanges a
   look with Tubbs.  But they say nothing.

                        TUBBS
                  (to Crockett)
             So?

                        CROCKETT
             We could try to run loads into
             these guys.
                  (to Fujima)
             Run a few loads for Montoya into
             South Florida.  Into this group.

                        FUJIMA
             You need to consider a few issues.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to Crockett + Tubbs)
             ...you'd be operating outside
             territorial United States.  Your	
             badges do not count.  You have no	
             authorization to carry weapons.  If
             you're busted, it could take a long
             time to get you re-patriated.  And	
             there's no backup...	
                  (to Fujima)
             And you will share with them all	
             your intel on Montoya...	

                        FUJIMA
             Sure.

                        CASTILLO
             I mean full disclosure.	

                        FUJIMA
             Of course.  From my side, I don't	
             WANT to know anything about what
             you're doing or how you do it...
                  (to Castillo)
             So let me know if we're on...

   Fujima splits.  Castillo waits until Fujima's car pulls away.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to Tubbs)
             About the Stevens family, I'm
             sorry.  I know you were close to
             them.

                        TUBBS
             I was the kids' godfather.

                        CASTILLO
                  (intuits)
             And...?

                        TUBBS
             "And" what?

                        CASTILLO
             I got to know.  There is never any
             room for "personal"...	

                        CROCKETT
                  (for Tubbs)
             He is fine.  And we know the jokes.
             When it gets vengeful, things get	
             messy.  When they get messy the
             wrong people die...
                  (beat)
             Everybody gets it.

                        CASTILLO
             Good.

                        TUBBS
             And the answer is "yes."
                  (beat)
             Before she met Alonzo, once upon a
             time, a long time ago.
                  (beat)
             You bet it was personal.

   ...and is now compartmentalized in the past.

                        CASTILLO
             Okay.
                  (to Crockett)
             What'd you spot...?

                        CROCKETT
             Three wakes off the back of those
             boats.  Who runs three Sterling
             engines off a deep-V hull?

                        TUBBS
             Sal Maguda.

                        CASTILLO
             He any good?

                        TUBBS
             Oh, yeah...

                        CASTILLO
             So what's gonna persuade Montoya to	
             change off Sal Maguda running his	
             deliveries...?

   It's a rhetorical question.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. INDIAN RIVER - THERMAL IMAGE OF TWO DEEP V-HULL GO-FAST
   BOATS - NIGHT

   They're two feet out of the water on their dry dock, next to
   a Marine Shed.

   It's an unlikely location because derelict factories, cheap
   apartments, weeds and marine scrap metal are the
   neighborhood.

   EXT. SURVEILLANCE LOCATION - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   and a SWAT team in the weeds across the river.  They include
   SGT. JEAN-LOUIS BASTIDE, a Haitian in dark sweats.  They all
   are in plain clothes.

                        BASTIDE
             Odile, she say they're pregnant...

   We don't know what that means, yet.

                        TUBBS
             Yeah?  Okay.  Only Jean-Louis and I
             do the talking...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MARINE SHED - DOOR - NIGHT

   Both steel doors EXPLODE as if their molecular structure,
   itself, disintegrated from one BLAST of Tubbs M-40 grenade-
   launcher firing a canister of ball bearings like a king-size
   shotgun on steroids as...

   GUARDS

   react, but Crockett draws down on one with an AK-47.  Bastide
   wounds the second GUARD who had drawn down his H & K.  A
   Third Guard begs to live in French Patois.  They own the
   place.  And Crockett sees...

   800 individually-wrapped bricks of North Valle Colombian
   cocaine are on a table.

                        TUBBS
             Comme on dit...
             (Like they said...)

                        JEAN-LOUIS
             Charger et les recoit d'ici...
             (Load 'em up and get out of
             here...)

                        BAD GUY
             You crazy?  Que fais-tu?

                        TUBBS
             Que faisons-nous?  De qu'a-t-il
             l'air, fou!  Nous voulons tous
             votre drugs.
             (What are we doing?  What's it look
             like we're doing, fool?  We are
             stealing all your dope.)

   Suburban crashes through the wreckage of the door and backs
   to the table.  Jean-Louis and SWAT #1 start throwing bricks
   into the back.  Tubbs with Crockett exit.

   EXT. MARINE SHED - DRY DOCK - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   approach the two deep V-hull go-fast boats with three engines
   off the back.  Tubbs cracks the breech of the grenade
   launcher and loads a 40-millimeter shell, while he strolls
   down the dock...

   CROCKETT

   tosses two Willie Peters (white phosphorus grenades) into the
   boats.  Tubbs fires the M-40 at a third boat, which explodes
   flame, followed by...

   TWO CARNATIONS OF WHITE PHOSPHORESCENCE

   destroy the smuggler's Strykers, which we saw in Fujima's
   video.  Crockett + Tubbs have just put Sal Maguda out of
   business.  They walk away and around the side of the shed,
   disregarding the curious citizens of Little Haiti, come to
   watch the fireworks...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES CL 600 ON A MIAMI STREET - CROCKETT + TUBBS -
   BRILLIANT DAYLIGHT

   drive.  Crockett reaches into a paper bag full of cell phones
   and grabs one.  He dials up a number, grabs another and hands
   it to Tubbs.

                        CROCKETT
                  (in the phone)
             Hey, Sailor...
                  (pause)
             Yeah, I'm good.
                  (beat)
             Got a hole in the

             cash flow.
                  (waits)
             Yeah, later.

   Crockett struck out.  While...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Hey, Nicholas, my ace.  Wha's up?

                        NICHOLAS (V.O.)
             You know.  Same old...

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             We got idle all of an instant.  You
             got something from somewhere that's
             got to go someplace, somewhen,
             which is not too distantly in the
             future...?

   INT. COLLINS AVENUE CONDO - NICHOLAS - DAY

   ...the guy with the white hair.

                        NICHOLAS
             It is fortuitous that you called...

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. LA PERLA DISTRICT OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - TWILIGHT

   Corrosion and decay.  People look coldly at us.  Malevolence
   and malefaction on every corner.  No one's picked up the
   garbage for a month.  Poverty in the Caribbean half-light...

   CROCKETT & TUBBS

   cross the street to CAMERA from their rental car.  The La
   Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates.  It's had
   little civic improvements in 400 years.

   They enter a nightclub - shabby neon.

   INT. NIGHTCLUB - CROCKETT + TUBBS - TWILIGHT

   There are no customers.  They're cautious.  Men stop them
   and frisk them.  They expected that.

                        CROCKETT
             We're from Nicholas to meet José...

   They're waved to the rear.  They start towards a back table.
   A small group of people wait...

   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS APPROACHING:  JOSÉ "COCHI LOCO" YERO

   He's a former right-wing Colombian paramilitary from the
   North Valle near the Pacific coast.  He runs operations,
   communications and security.  He has cold eyes and a corpulent
   face.  He's notorious for using torture to ferret-out
   informants.  Right now he watches these two Americans
   approach.  Security people are on either side of him.

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (extends hand)
             José...

                        CROCKETT
             Sonny Burnett...this is my partner,
             Rico.

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Sit.

   As Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the
   side is a woman.  This is ISABELLA.  Behind glasses, she
   seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in
   subdued Tom Ford and staring at him.  Reading him.  Crockett
   holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business...

                        CROCKETT
                  (to Security)
             Dos café.

   He's security, not a fucking waiter.  But Yero nods.
   Security fetches coffee, anyway.

                        TUBBS
             So lay it out, my brother...

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Nicholas said you okay.  That's
             nice.  But how I know if you any	
             good?

                        CROCKETT
             What...?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Who you run loads for?  Cause other	
             than Nicholas, you knows you?

   Tubbs looks at Crockett.  They thought it was a done deal.	

                        CROCKETT
                  (dark)	
             My mommy and daddy know me.

   Isabella tilts her head imperceptibly.

                        TUBBS
             And we didn't come down here to	
             audition.  Business auditions for	
             us...
                  (beat)
             ...and know who we are and know	
             they want their load run by us	
             before Nicholas calls.

                        CROCKETT
             That way we do not waste AvGas or
             our motherfucking time.

   Yero's security reacts to the tone and raises weapons.  A few
   start up out of their chair as...

   ZITO + SWITEK

   appear at the door, SMGs from shoulder straps.  Zito flips a
   D14 hand grenade which Crockett snatches out of the air,
   pulls the pin and slams on the table.  Everyone FREEZES.

   Only Crockett's hand pressure restrains the clip.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
                  (goes right up in Yero's
                   face)
             You want to "know" shit?  Who the	
             fuck are you?  You got a side deal	
             with U.S. Customs to open up the	
             coast in a few spots...in exchange
             you flip them some gringo runners?
             Like us...?

                        TUBBS
             You wearing a wire?	

   Tubbs rips open Yero's shirt.

                        CROCKETT
             Or DEA?  The Feeb?	

   Yero's shirt...open to the waist.  No wire.  Yero's furious.

   Yero's people have weapons pointed their way.  They outnumber
   Switek and Zito.  Slack's taken up on triggers.  It's on the
   edge.  And the edge is overloaded.  Tubbs reads that, warns
   Yero...

                        TUBBS
             People gonna walk into this place
             and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some	
             crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild!	
             Is that a Jackson Pollack?"

                        CROCKETT
             "No, viejo.  That was José Yero,
             splattered all over his
             motherfucking wall."

                        TUBBS
             So we can close each other's eyes
             right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.
                  (pause)
             But, then, nobody makes any
             money...	

   Yero gestures his security to calm down....one notch.
   Crockett and Tubbs still hold the grenades.

   Then Crockett opens his shirt.  No wires.  So does Tubbs.	

   Pause.

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (flat)
             Equipment?

                        TUBBS
             Slow and low, Adam A-500s...
                  (Yero looks quizzical)
             ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400
             nautical-mile range, thousand ki
             payload...all the way to Caravels
             and 727's from a source country to
             a transshipment point.  Small
             freighters.  We've done
             containers...

                        CROCKETT
             And specialize in very fast go-fast
             boats for coastal runs.

                        TUBBS
             What kind of weight?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             We don't talk weight.  We talk
             logistics.

   Isabella sits, watching this.  She drinks her coffee.

                        JOSÉ YERO (cont'd)
             You get longs and lats for the
             pickup.  Open ocean.  You run it
             in.  On shore, our people receive
             the loads.

                        CROCKETT
                  (interrupts)
             The people on shore who handle a
             load we run are our people, not your	
             people.  No tweakers, dopers, first-	
             timers we don't know.  They didn't
             do time with us, they ain't doing
             crime with us.	

                        TUBBS	
             What you get from us is a date.  A
             place.  "In the parking lot of a
             Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At
             such-and-such time, an eighteen-	
             wheeler will be there.  Keys in the
             ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick	
             it up.  And you drive it...
                  (waves his left hand)
             ...away.

                        CROCKETT	
             Money thing is done in advance in	
             places where there are no guns.	                        
             Because when money and guns get	
             together, there is violence...

                        JOSÉ YERO
             You afraid of violence?

                        CROCKETT	
             I am not John Wayne.  There is no	
             "S" on his chest.  We get down if	
             the play calls for it.  But we are
             into business and making money.	

                        TUBBS	
             And violence is extra.  And
             expensive.  So how much weight you
             looking to move?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Nothing.  'Cause how you do	
             delivery on the beach, I don't
             like.  Maybe this does not work.

                        CROCKETT
             Then it don't work.

                        TUBBS
             What happened to the last
             transporter you had?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             What do you care?

                        TUBBS
                  (to Crockett)
             Do we need this...?

                        CROCKETT
                  (rises)
             Red light, green light, José?

                        JOSÉ YERO

                   back)
             I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That
             means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I
             enforce security and get people to	
             tell me what I need to know.  That	
             part of what I do, you never want	
             to find out about.
                  (pause)
             Other people will negotiate the	
             money and go or not go.  Not me...

                        TUBBS
             Then what were we talking to you
             for?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             I had to lay eyes on you.

                        CROCKETT
             And...?

   Isabella watches Crockett...

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (to Tubbs)
             You seem okay.
                  (to Tubbs re: Crockett)
             But him?  I don't like... how he	
             looks...

   Everything goes from tense to lethal.  Has Yero made them?

                        TUBBS
             What do I care what you think about
             how he looks?  You wanna fuck my	
             partner or do business?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             Wait by the phone.
                  (pause)
             You get a call.  Or maybe you
             don't.  Until then, piss off back
             to where you come from...

   Crockett flips the hand grenade and catches it with his left
   hand...and he drops it in front of José Yero.  It spins on
   the table.  He had reinserted the pin.  And they back out.

   INT. MIAMI SAFE HOUSE - TUBBS IN THE SHOWER - NIGHT

   Contemplative.  Offscreen a door opens.  Entering is Gina
   Calabrese.  She's naked.  She washes his back.  She dumps too
   much shampoo on his head.  He tries to clear it from his
   eyes.  Laughs.  They start to make love under the water, in
   the steam, through the misted glass, offscreen we hear an
   engine rumble...

   CLOSER:  GINA

   Somebody's coming.

                        TUBBS
             ...Sonny can wait.

   Tubbs and Gina are not random lovers, they're in love.  The
   look in her eyes, the openness is pure femininity behind the
   Bronx presentation.  She smiles, touches the side of his
   face.

   EXT. SAFE HOUSE, ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT - NIGHT

   ties up a 75' Sun Seeker.  It looks like a 38' deep-V
   offshore racer on growth hormones.  Crockett's alone, as dusk
   fades over the '60's ranch house on the river.  It's under
   tropical trees, with one strip of white neon utility lighting
   outlining the flat eave.

   INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - CROCKETT

   let himself in.  He's at a kitchen stool at the counter when
   Tubbs enters in sweats.

                        TUBBS
             Anything?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.

   Gina enters in a robe...

                        GINA
                  (beat)
             "Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."

                        CROCKETT
             Hi, Gina.
                  (putting shopping bag on
                   table)
             This is from Frick and Frack.
             Trudy?

                        TUBBS
                  (re:  bag)
             What do we got?

   Crockett pulls out three overly-large cell phones...

                        CROCKETT
             Satellite.  New encryption.
             Supposedly sharper than the G...
                  (to Gina)
             How good's our background?

   Tubbs and Crockett look at the Mac screen as Gina boots it
   up.  Gina's fingers tap dance on the keyboard.

                        GINA
             You're so not the PD, if you got
             busted on a DUI, you're in serious
             trouble...you're bad men back to
             grammar school.
                  (to Tubbs)
             San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.
                  (to Crockett)
             Marine Corps.  Statesville.
             Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked
             up.  Now you're too smart and too
             fast to get jacked again...

                        CROCKETT
             How will it stand up?

                        GINA
             If they ran the rental car or lease
             on this place...even if it's EPIC
             database in El Paso...they'd have
             to work through the layers of
             bullshit three weeks deep.  Then
             they'd find your deeper, hidden
             criminal selves...

   INT. LIVING ROOM - BAD 3 AM TELEVISION - LATER

   No one's watching it.

   INT. BEDROOM - GINA

   asleep.  Tubbs' eyes are wide open, staring...

   INT. SECOND BEDROOM - ECU:  PAGER

   lights up.  Beeps.  Crockett's hand grabs it.  It's the
   summons from José Yero.

   INT. KITCHEN - GINA - PRE-DAWN

                        GINA

             get my nails and hair done...?

                        TUBBS
             Reality TV and stay by the phone.	
             That's what all wives-in-crime
             do...

   He leans over and kisses her.  She holds firmly the back of
   his neck and looks into his eyes.

                        GINA
             Be...careful...  You hear me?

   He winks at her in assurance and he's gone.  Her lazy smile
   drops off.  "Careful"...she's not so sure he will be...

   INT. LEAR 55 JET - TUBBS PILOTS

   Crockett in the copilot seat.  Switek and Zito are in the
   back, barely awake.  Zito hands out coffee.  Switek's
   stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery.  Tubbs is
   clearing US air space as we...

   EXT. SKY - AERIAL:  LEAR JET

   INT. PORT-AU-PRINCE HOTEL ROOM - DOOR - DAY

   Crockett and Tubbs make a careful entry.  Hands on weapons,
   carrying bags...

                        CROCKETT
             What do we got?

                        TUBBS
             Five minutes...

   We see TRADECRAFT.  They clear the room.  They check for bugs
   and external surveillance.  They pull curtains.  Tubbs from a
   bag pulls a scanner.  Under the two beds.  Behind the
   picture.  The lamp.  The telephone.  Meanwhile...

   CROCKETT

   "traps" the room to reveal if it had been searched while they
   were gone.  He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the
   bench.  A matchstick goes against the closed closet door.  A
   ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             ...show time.

   From his bag Tubbs pulls a Smith & Wesson J-frame hammerless
   in .357 Magnum.  He holsters this on his ankle.  A Remington
   780 shotgun with pistol grip, sawed-off to a 12-inch barrel
   gets slung on a bungee-cord shoulder strap under his right
   arm.  .9mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare
   magazines clipped to his belt.

   CROCKETT

   loads a .45 "race" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported
   barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt .45 Para-Ordnance in the
   small of his back.  They're ready.

   INT. CORRIDOR - THEIR DOOR

   opens.  Crockett "traps" that door, too, with a small piece
   of tape.

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   All of it tells us that where they are and where they're
   going is a high wire act without a net.  No backup.  Their
   badges don't work.  There is no law; there is no order.  They
   are in a state of nature where people get killed for their
   shoes.

                                                  DISSOLVE

             watching us waiting for them?  Or

             Who knows...

   Still apprehensive, concluding they're victims of a "no-
   show"...

                        TUBBS
             That's it.

   They split.

   INT. HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - CROCKETT + TUBBS -
   TWILIGHT

   approach their door.  Crockett stops.  The tape "trap" is
   torn.  Weapons appear in their hands.  Someone's been here.

   INT. HOTEL ROOM - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   enter stealthily.  Then, they relax.  They need not have
   bothered being so careful about detecting a clandestine
   surveillance.

   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS

   The room is overtly destroyed.  Not one piece of furniture is
   unbroken.  Walls have been opened.  Pictures ripped.
   Curtains.  Their stuff's strewn all over.  And, then...

   DOORS CRASH

   in.  HAITIAN PARAMILITARY in soccer jerseys and shorts with
   assault rifles...

   BEDROOM DOORWAY - FOUR MORE PARAMILITARY

   AK's are aimed at Crockett and Tubbs' heads.  Crockett's .45
   and his Para-Ordnance are in each hand.  Tubbs' shotgun is
   aimed at the front door, his .9mm at the men streaming in the
   windows.  Frozen moment.  A woman's voice...

                        ISABELLA (O.S.)
                  (to Crockett)
             Put your guns on the table...
                  (enters, sits)
             If we wanted you dead, you would no
             longer be drawing breath in Miami.
             We wouldn't have brought you all
             the way here.

                        CROCKETT
             Really?  So, what is this, a party?

   Crockett + Tubbs put down their weapons.

                        TUBBS
             We'll have room service wipe up the
             furniture...and bring drinks.

   Isabella says something in French.  The Cops ease-up.
   Isabella's personal security frisks Crockett + Tubbs and
   remain.  Paramilitary leave.

                        CROCKETT
             Glad we came.  This place is a lot
             of fun if you're Doctors Without
             Borders.  So...?

   Isabella takes off her glasses.  She's Afro-Cuban.

                        ISABELLA
             I run down the numbers.  Nothing is
             very negotiable.  Small loads?  We
             pay three thousand a ki.
             We pay your fuel costs up front
             plus ten percent.  The next ten
             percent on U.S. landfall.

                        TUBBS
             Define small.

                        ISABELLA
             Two, three thousand a ki.
             Two thousand ki's, your end is
             $6,000,000.
                  (beat)
             Complex transshipments or dealing
             with containers, these have front-

             For this kind of weight, the

             Transactions are offshore.  Dollars

             Right now.

   As she leaves...

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT

   in the back seat on a rural road.  Isabella is not with them.
   One of her Russians is.  In the front seat, his SMG is ready;
   his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs.

   EXT. ROAD - CARAVAN

   A military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her
   security.  Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with
   Haitian paramilitary.

   INT. MERCEDES - TUBBS

   They approach a town.  He nudges Crockett.  A police
   roadblock's ahead.

   CROCKETT

   has seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his
   waist.

   TUBBS' POV:  PAGER - NO SIGNAL

   That's what's surprising.  Tubbs pulls his cell phone.
   Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock.
   Crockett gets tense...

   TUBBS

   watches.  His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to
   zero.

   EXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS

   stop the caravan.  Is this turning bad?

   INT. CAR - CROCKETT

   alarmed.

   EXT. ROADBLOCK - HAITIAN COPS

   check under the vehicles with mirrors.  See all the weapons.
   Salute.  Usher the convoy past.

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   exchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as
   security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances
   towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by
   Haitian military.

   EXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR

   is snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and
   Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
   Mercedes pulls forward...

   CROCKETT

   eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban
   area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over
   Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a
   dope deal.

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   SEE a third circle of security approach.

   PRIVATE-SECTOR TYPES IN BUSINESS SUITS

   carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some
   with night-vision goggles.  The vehicles stop.

   EXT. TOWN SQUARE

   Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.  They're pushed
   around and searched.  A working class Glaswegion Scot, a
   couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and
   shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex-
   SAS).  Russians are ex-KGB.  Languages overheard:  smatterings
   of Russian, Hebrew and English.  Crockett and Tubbs look at
   each other:  they get it.  This is the cream of private
   sector security.  And it says top dollar infrastructure.

   THEY + WE SEE:  EXT. TOWN SQUARE

   Four avenues lead in.  Each avenue is blocked.  The square is
   closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.  Locals have
   disappeared.  In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING
   BLACK SUBURBANS.

   CROCKETT

   gestures to Tubbs to look up.  They see...

   ROOFTOPS:  TWO-MAN TEAMS - SNIPER + SPOTTER

   with night-vision goggles...

   CROCKETT + TUBBS

   are clean.

   CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA

   cross through a no-man's land.  It feels like being in the
   open in Kosovo.

   TUBBS

   checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a
   hydraulic mast.  The rear's converted into computer equipment
   sitting in ruggedized racks...

   INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - WIDE

   Doors open.  The interior has been converted into a
   luxurious, limo-like office with swivel seats.  Isabella
   followed by Crockett and Tubbs enter.  It's occupied by
   ARCHANGEL DE JESUS MONTOYA-LONDONO.  He's not flashy.  He has
   smooth skin, slightly opalescent, black eyes.  His right arm
   is normal length, but shriveled.

                        MONTOYA
             Please take that seat on the
             side...

                        TUBBS
             Thank you.

                        MONTOYA
                  (polite, friendly)
             Excuse me because I am very busy
             and have many things to do, so this
             will be brief.  Yes?
                  (beat; not waiting)
             We will try you on a "run."  One.
             To build trust.  We do a thousand
             kis.  In all matters, when you work
             for us, you must do exactly what
             you say you will do.
                  (beat)
             In this business with me, if you
             say you will do a thing, you must
             do exactly that thing.
                  (beat)
             Then?  You will prosper beyond your
             dreams and you can live in Miami in
             millionaire style.
                  (beat)
             If you are arrested, there will be
             lawyers made available to you in
             the United States.  You will use
             them.  Anything you need, you will
             be provided by me.  It cost you
             nothing.  You will contact and work
             through José Yero on logistics and
             communications.  To do with money,
             you will work through my wife,
             Isabella...

   Crockett notices that Montoya lightly holds her hand.  It's
   confident.  And he sees the slight smile on Isabella's face
   as she watches he and Tubbs...

                        MONTOYA (cont'd)
             More than I, in finance and
             business, she is very dangerous.  I
             look forward to our doing work
             together.  Whether we do or not, it
             is unlikely we will meet again.  So
             I extend my best wishes to your
             families...
                  (to Tubbs)
             Particularly to your beautiful
             wife.
                  (beat)
             Thank you for making this long trip
             to see me...

   Dismissed, they exit.

   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EXTREMELY CLOSE:  TUBBS

   Subterranean alarms are going off.  Tubbs finds himself in
   this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their
   security in the middle of nowhere.  Urgency agitates Tubbs.
   He controls it...

   CROCKETT

   in the town square, now, too.  But Isabella stayed inside
   Montoya's Suburban.  Now, she lowers her window.

   ROADBLOCKS

   break up.  Montoya's Suburbans pull out.  The security cordon
   deforms.  It all disappears around them.  It leaves only the
   Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs...

   CLOSER:  CROCKETT

   looks after the caravan.

   CROCKETT'S POV:  ISABELLA'S EYES

   in the side-view mirror on the passenger side.  She is
   looking at him.

   CROCKETT

   holds that look.

   ISABELLA'S EYES IN THE MIRROR

   holds his.

   CROCKETT

   Sound deadens.  His attention is on the woman in the
   mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell
   phone.

   TUBBS' CELL PHONE

   Signal strength returns.  Tubbs punches in numbers.

                        TUBBS
                  (low)
             ...who did we just meet?

   He waits.  A phone rings.  It's picked up by Gina.

                        GINA (O.S.)
             Hello...?

   Tubbs is relieved...

                        TUBBS
             You okay?

                        GINA
             Yeah.

                        TUBBS
             You sure?

                        GINA
             Yes.  What's up?

                        TUBBS
             Nothing.  Calling to say hi...
             What's up with you?

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

   INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GINA

                        GINA
             Bored.

   To Tubbs, that's good news.

                        TUBBS
             Okay...see you soon.

                        GINA
             ...and thanks for the flowers.

   EXT. HAITIAN TOWN SQUARE - TUBBS

                        TUBBS
             What flowers?

                        GINA
             The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred
             dollars worth of roses...yellow.

   Pause.

                        TUBBS
             There a note?

   Pause.

                        GINA
             You mean with the flowers...?

                        TUBBS
             What's it say?

                        GINA
             "Salutations from the south..."

   A deep chill.

                        GINA (cont'd)
             I...I thought it was from you.
   
   And, now, she gets it.  Gina is in the kitchen.  Alone, in
   their secret safe-house location.  She and Tubbs have nothing
   to say.  He looks to Crockett.  The message from Montoya-
   Londono is clear:  I know you.  I can reach out and locate
   you our yours.  Anytime.  YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

                        TUBBS
             We're on our way...

   INT. KITCHEN - GINA - NIGHT

                        TUBBS (O.S.)
                  (forced casual)
             So why don't you...meet the
             plane...

   We sense this is code.  It means get the fuck out of there
   right now!

                        GINA
                  (cool)
             Okay.

                        TUBBS
             Good idea.
                  (beat)
             We'll grab a bite.

   Gina ends the call, drops to the floor to the wall, kills the
   lights, holds her Sig .9mm at her side as she moves deeper
   into the interior...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. CUBAN CAFE ON CALLE OCHO, MIAMI - TUBBS + GINA - 4 AM

   Close on their two faces.  He's holding her hand under the
   table.  The noise of the surrounding crowd is a ROAR.  That's
   the idea.  They want their words buried under noise...

   PAST GINA:  CROCKETT

   discreetly at the door, watching the street.  Trudy, Switek
   and Zito are at adjacent tables.

                        GINA
             ...the lease, the phones, the
             cars...layers of false ident.
             Would take the FBI weeks.  How long
             did it take them?  Three hours?
             Four?
                  (re:  the note)
             This means, "We can reach out and
             touch somebody."  Like Bad
             Teleflora.

                        TUBBS
                  (cuts in)
             ...even if they could run the
             identities you built to EPIC, all
             they'll find is more cover...
             Trust what you built.  It's
             quality, girl.  We're cool...

                        GINA
                  (leans in; holds his hand
                   tighter)
             ...you are trying to reassure me
             because you know when people get
             anxious, they make mistakes.
             You're worried about me.  Do not
             be.
                  (into his eyes)
             I am careful.  I am cool.  I got
             Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry
             about you.  Because you are the
             ones who are in denied territory,
             not me.  If your focus is on me,
             you'll miss something coming at
             you.  That's how people slip up.
             Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything
             happened.  You worry about you.
             You and Sonny...are in the
             dangerous place.  I'm fine...

   Gina leans back in her chair.  Their eyes still connect
   across the distance between them.  Their hands still touch.

                        GINA (cont'd)
                  (loud)
             Fuck 'em.  They sent us some
             flowers.  Big deal.  Thanks for the
             flowers...

   Gina Calabrese shrugs.  Tubbs laughs, and we are...

   INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - 4 AM

   Low music.  Dark shadows.  Half-light washes the walls from
   passing headlights.  Tubbs are Gina are naked.  It's the
   lovemaking of a man and a woman when they hold precious the
   moments they have because they know that in these moments
   they are safe.  And that the present is fleeting.  And they
   know their time together is about luck.  Because life is
   short.  Departure is imminent.  Nothing lives forever.  It's
   in their faces and their eyes...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. SHACK (GUAJIRA PENINSULA, COLOMBIA) - CROCKETT - DAWN

   A lantern lights his face.  The night is soft.  Crockett's
   with a couple of campesinos, playing poker and drinking beer.

   Whoever's shack this is, is a Tupac Shakur freak.  His image
   is on all the walls.  A diesel truck starts and pulls away
   outside.

   EXT. LANDING STRIP - TUBBS - NIGHT

   checking the cargo tie-downs inside an A-500 Adam aircraft.
   He's sweating.  His shirt's off.  The cargo is ten black
   plastic-wrapped and taped bundles.  Like any good pilot,
   Tubbs trusts nobody but himself to tie-down the load.  The
   rear seats are removed.  There's a plastic bladder holding a
   reserve of 50 gallons of AvGas.

   INT. SHACK - CROCKETT

   wins.  The girls shriek.  Crockett pushes the money towards
   the Campesinos.  They refuse.  Crockett insists.  One will	
   only accept the money if Crockett accepts his Randall hunting
   knife.  He does.  Tubbs is in the doorway.

                        CROCKETT
             We set.

   Crockett kisses the girls, gracious about the gift.  Tubbs
   looks out into the night.

                        TUBBS
             To the limit.

                        CROCKETT
             You worried about the tree line, US
             Customs AWACS, or something else on
             your mind?

                        TUBBS
             Like...?

                        CROCKETT
             Gina in the Miami pad.
                  (no answer)
             You gonna give me phony denials?

                        TUBBS
             No.
                  (beat)
             You gonna give me phony
             reassurances?

                        CROCKETT
             No.

                        TUBBS
             Good.  So let's go...

   They head toward the strange-looking plane.  It's a single
   fuselage with two propellers...one at the nose, one at the
   tail.  Off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear
   wing.  It's a Burt Rutan aircraft design.

   There is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or IF
   to spot.  It does 200 knots at 22,000 feet.  It'll fly,
   forever, 1,000 kilos of flake worth $23 million, and the
   total air weight is less than two Bentleys.  It's the
   smuggler's dream airplane.

   EXT. LANDING STRIP - END OF RUNWAY - A-500 ADAMS

   heads for the tree-line.  It will not make it.  At the last
   moment, Tubbs pulls back the stick and the plane lofts over
   the trees, clipping the tops...

   INT. A-500 - CROCKETT

   throws a look sideways at Tubbs.

   EXT. SKY - A-500

   airborne over the Caribbean, heading north...

                        CROCKETT (O.S.)
                  (into radio)
             Transglobal Airlines flight zero-
             zero-zero...is in the air...

                        ZITO (V.O.)
             Roger that.

   INT. A-500 - CROCKETT - MUCH LATER

   is dozing.  A signal.

   Tubbs points up and to the right.  Crockett wakes, looks.  An
   Aero Commander Turbo Twin is paralleling the A-500's course.
   Now, it slides over them...almost into a collision.  It sits
   right over the A-500, separated by only 75 feet.

   INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER - DAY

   handling a myriad of flights, reacts.  On his radar he sees
   next to the image of the Aero Commander, a ghost image....

                        AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
             Eleven-ten, Sierra, do you have a
             visual on another aircraft...?

   INT. AERO COMMANDER - SWITEK + ZITO - DAY

   Switek is flying and looks down at the A-500 below...

                        ZITO
             Negative, Opa-Locka.

   INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

   keys his radio.

                        AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
             Opa-Locka Air Traffic Control to
             JIT 0-seven-six-Nellie-Charlie...

                        AWAC (V.O.)
             Hello, Opa-Locka.  What's up?

                        AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER
             I've got an Aero Commander coming
             in on a two-seventy-nine heading,
             but I had a double image...like
             there's another plane there, now
             I'm only picking up on one.  What
             do you read?

   INT. US CUSTOMS AWAC - RADAR OFFICER

                        RADAR OFFICER
             Let me see...

   His FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) picks up Switek and
   Zito's Air Commander.  He flips through all the different
   modalities of detection, including thermography, for anything
   else suspicious in the airspace...

                        AWAC RADAR OFFICER
                  (into mic)
             Too many Mai Tais at lunch...
             You're seeing double.  One blip.
             One plane.

   EXT. SKY - SIDE SHOT:  THE AERO COMMANDER LIKE A PANCAKE ON
   TOP OF THE A-500 RIGHT BELOW IT

   We get the joke.  The A-500 with its stealthiness under the
   Aero Commander together like a single footprint.

   AERIAL ANGLE:  TWO PLANES

   piggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into
   Florida.

   From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on
   approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the
   contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane
   and its load into the United States of America.	

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. CIRCLE 6 MOTEL, PARKING LOT - U-HAUL-IT TRUCK - NIGHT

   Alone in the acid-yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights.
   We wait.  We don't know why we're here.

   PARKING LOT PERIMETER - SAWGRASS

   MOVE IN...and we REVEAL staked-out are Crockett, Jean-Louis
   and Tubbs...

                        CROCKETT
             Neptune gonna show?

   We don't know who he's talking about.

                        JEAN-LOUIS
             Oh, he'll show.  This is his kind
             of deal.  Crime on crime.  Who's
             gonna call the cops?

                        CROCKETT
                  (skeptical)
             Usually his thing is street
             dealers.  Torture their families
             until they cough up the stash.
             This...?

                        JEAN-LOUIS
             He's ambitious.

                        TUBBS
             Heads up...

   ESCALADE

   Lights off.  Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul-
   It to the other side and disappears.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's
             worth more than the real estate.
             But no one's supposed to notice his
             drive-by?

                        CROCKETT
             Here's another incognito genius...

   ANOTHER ANGLE:  MALIBU SS

   cruises the other end of the parking lot.  The Escalade
   returns.  All's clear.  Both converge around the U-Haul-It
   truck.  Out of the Escalade steps NEPTUNE - 6'4", narrow-
   shouldered and bald.  From the Malibu and back of the
   Escalade, Four more Haitian ZO POUNDERS with handguns,
   shotguns and shades...

   NEPTUNE

   pops the lock on the U-Haul-It with a crowbar.  He rolls up
   the door expecting millions worth of cocaine.  Instead he
   comes face to face with the barrel of a 12-gauge...

                        TRUDY
             April Fool, motherfucker.

   Trudy whips the butt end of the shotgun around, caving in
   Neptune's cheekbone and nose...

   WIDER - NEPTUNE

   goes down for the count.  Switek - under the truck - rolls
   out.  Crockett, Tubbs with shotguns, Jean-Louis and Zito with
   CAR-15s emerge from the perimeter with bright lights on
   shouting for the Haitians to freeze...

                        TUBBS
                  (Patois)
             Arrete!  Arrete!  Freeze!
                  (to one)
             Et vous, mo-fo!

   A 250-lb. ZO POUNDER brings up his weapon.  Crockett BLOWS
   the guy's legs out from under him.  Zito disarms him.  The
   other two are disarmed.

   NEPTUNE

   is rolled over by Crockett.  He plastic-ties his wrists and
   feet.  Others are manhandled...

                        JEAN-LOUIS
                  (in French)
             Get the fuck in the truck...!

   Zo Pounders, plastic-tied, are thrown into the truck with the
   thousand kilos of cocaine.  But not Neptune.  The gate is
   rolled down and padlocked.

   INT. SAFE HOUSE - CROCKETT - NIGHT

   staring at his satellite cell.  Waiting.  He looks out the
   window at the passing river.  Soft voices from another
   room...probably Tubbs and Gina.  It's five in the morning.
   It rings.  He answers.

                        JOSÉ YERO (O.S.)
             Client got delivery.  But there
             were..."extras" in the back of the

                        CROCKETT
             "Extras" tried to relieve us of

                        CROCKETT
             He tried to..."do business"...with

             there.

                        JOSÉ YERO
             I'll be there.

   EXT. OVERTOWN STREET - JOSÉ YERO IN A TINTED EXCURSION - DAY

   cruises storefront churches, chacouteries, Baptist missions,
   Haitian restaurants and palm trees.  Men in dark trousers and
   white shirts lean in doorways.  The SUV preceding Yero stops
   three houses before us.  The Excursion with Yero stops two
   houses beyond.  Security - very casually - deploys.  NOW,
   Yero approaches...seen through the curtains of the window
   we're looking through.  Reveal Tubbs watching.

   And, he crosses to the door and opens it as Yero cautiously
   enters.

   INT. LIVING ROOM - YERO

   And his face registers surprise.

                        CROCKETT
             Look familiar?

   DOPE

   Carefully stacked in the living room are the PLASTIC-WRAPPED
   BRICKS OF COCAINE THAT CROCKETT AND TUBBS STOLE FROM SAL
   MAGUDA'S WAREHOUSE WHEN THEY BLEW UP HIS BOATS.

   Hog-tied and bleeding all over his clothes, in the corner is
   Neptune.  His mouth is taped.  He's shaking his

                        TUBBS
             This the load you lost a while
             back?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             It is.  He try to take tonight's
             load?

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.

                        JOSÉ YERO
             And what do I do with him?

                        TUBBS
                  (shrugs)
             Whatever you want.  Like we said,
             we're not into violence.

   Yero looks around the corner and sees Switek and Zito in the
   dining room, casually at ease with Galil assault
   rifles...meaning "don't even think about it"...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. AN EMPTY MANSION - JOSÉ YERO - DAY

   The empty mansion is on its own peninsula.  Through the
   windows we see a yacht and Crockett's 48' Stryker, its canopy
   open but without its racing supergraphics.  The mansion
   interior...all Beaumaniers limestone...is devoid of all
   furnishing.  They sit on white plastic garden chairs from
   Sears.

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (suspicious)
             I walk into Neptune's house...very
             nice.  But I also see you... and
             our drugs that got ripped from
             Maguda.

                        TUBBS
             You don't like us finding your
             load?  We can go and lose it all
             over again...

                        CROCKETT
             How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know
             where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op
             sec's got a leak?  Yours?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             What'd Neptune tell you?

                        CROCKETT
             He didn't.  Interrogation's not in
             our skill set.
                  (beat)
             So c'mon, what suspicions have you
             master-minded off these
             associations?

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (whispers in Spanish to
                   Isabella)
             Here's what this is...ask how much
             they want to turn back to us our
             load...

   Yero's certain about their motive.

                        ISABELLA
             We want it back.

                        CROCKETT
             Okay.

                        ISABELLA
             What's the recovery?  How much are
             you looking for?

                        TUBBS
                  (to Crockett)
             How much we looking for?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.

                        ISABELLA
             What's "nothing"?

                        CROCKETT
             Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."

                        TUBBS
             And as an investment in the
             future...

                        ISABELLA
                  (takes off her glasses and
                   looks at Crockett)
             "Future" of...?

                        CROCKETT
             A fine...business...relationship...

   She holds Crockett's look...as she did before.

                        TUBBS
             It's yours cause what's yours, is
             yours.  And what's ours is ours...
                  (to Yero)
             ...like the second ten-percent,
             which is now due, Yero, my ace.

   Isabella gestures.  Yero kicks across the floor a cardboard
   box full of money.  Tubbs glances inside.  Doesn't count it.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
             What's up next?  Or is this a one-
             time deal?

   Isabella decides.

                        ISABELLA
                  (to Yero)
             Give them the shipment on the
             seventeenth...

   Yero doesn't like it.  She gestures "do it."

                        TUBBS
             Conveyance?

                        ISABELLA
             Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.

   And she starts to leave...and sensing Crockett's gotten up
   and follows her.  Meanwhile

                        TUBBS
                  (to Yero)
             Lay it out...

   And Crockett, close behind Isabella, now...

                        CROCKETT
                  (low)
             There is one thing you can do for
             me in recognition of the death-
             defying risks we took to recover
             your product...

                        ISABELLA
                  (low)
             And what is that?

   This is the wife of narcotrafficker Archangel de Jesus
   Montoya-Londono.

                        CROCKETT
             Let me buy you a drink.

   Isabella pauses.  Crockett may get killed right now.  They're
   near the open doors to the patio.

                        ISABELLA
                  (low)
             What do you like to drink?

                        CROCKETT
                  (low)
             I'm a fiend for mojitas.

   Isabella looks over at Crockett's boat.  Back to Crockett...

                        ISABELLA
                  (low)
             How fast does that go?

                        CROCKETT
             It goes very fast.

                        ISABELLA
             Show me...?

   Isabella and Crockett head outside towards the dock, Tubbs
   overtakes...

                        TUBBS
             Can I talk to you for a second,
             partner...?

   They step aside.

                        TUBBS (cont'd)
                  (low, re:  Isabella)
             Wha's up...?

                        CROCKETT
                  (low)
             I know what I'm doing.

   And he leaves to help Isabella board.  Switek unties and
   pushes off the boat.  Looking out the window at them is José
   Yero, as perplexed as Tubbs, who covers...

                        TUBBS
             ...secure satellite comms.
             encrypted e-mail, the longs and
             lats for the transshipment
             point...all that?  It's all cool.
             But I need a vector, not a
             location.  'Cause ships move.
             That's why they call them ships.
             Ship stops?  It's trying to be an
             apartment building.  At sea that
             attracts attention.  That's bad...

   Meanwhile...

   INT. STRYKER, CABIN - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   pulling away from the docks at 12 knots, repressing the
   thunder of the 2,700-horsepower engines.  Crockett leaves the
   canopy slid back.  They're open to the air.  He gives
   Isabella headsets so they can talk over the roar.  The wind
   starts to move her hair.  She's not sure how to put on the
   headset.

   Crockett lets the boat rock over the swells while he arranges
   her headset around her ears.  His fingers brush her hair,
   touch her skin...

   It was not intentional.  But the look in Crockett's eyes is
   as if a small voltage passed through him.

   He plugs her headset into the dash, regains the wheel, shoves
   the throttles forward and...

   EXT. OPEN OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN"

   cuts and then leaps over swells.  In seven seconds they're
   doing over 70 knots.  And Crockett holds it there as...

   ISABELLA

   The wind whips her hair behind her, now.  The two are small
   against the smooth 50' long hull.  Crockett hands her
   wraparound shades for her eyes.  She doesn't want them...

                        CROCKETT
                  (through headset)
             So where's the best place for
             mojitas?

                        ISABELLA
             Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the only
             place for mojitas...

                        CROCKETT
             Where's that?

                        ISABELLA
             Off a little alley with
             cobblestones.  Hemingway went
             there...

                        CROCKETT
             The Keys?

                        ISABELLA
             Havana.

                        CROCKETT
             Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my
             business...

                        ISABELLA
             Are you afraid?
                  (smiles; Crockett shakes
                   his head "no")
             Good.  And you don't need a visa.
             Cause you're with me.

   EXT. OPEN OCEAN - OVERHEAD "BORN TO WIN" - DAY

   rockets from one swell to the next, getting airborne.  Wind
   and salt electrify Isabella.  She turns to Crockett and
   smiles, putting on the glasses, now.  Crockett gestures to
   her knees.  She should keep them bent.  Crockett pushes it to
   75 knots...

   FRONTAL:  CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   in strong light, ripped by wind.  Behind them are ocean and
   sky and twenty-foot plumes which jet from the props and make
   a wake that vectors in diagonals to what each is leaving
   behind them...where they've been...and converge to push them
   to the new places where they're headed.  Behind, the skies
   are leaden.  They're racing a storm.  Sunlight shafts through
   a gap in thunderclouds, turning the clouds yellow.  Now, they
   turn peach against the darkening open water and the grey sky
   behind.  The boat vibrates, the engines scream and...

   CROCKETT

   waves her over to join him behind the wheel.  He holds out
   his left hand to steady her.  He brings her to him.  Both
   lean against his high upholstered chair.  He holds her to his
   side.  Indicates the wheel...

                        CROCKETT
             Light touch.  Everything comes to
             you through the wheel.

   CROCKETT

   stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out
   of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward
   when reentering.  The swells are now four feet.  They launch
   off each, get airborne, cut into the next...

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             How do we get into Cuba?!

                        ISABELLA
             My cousin is the harbor master.
             You must not bring in drugs.  You
             cannot be armed.  If you're
             carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it
             inside.  No one will go near your
             boat...

                        CROCKETT
             You do business in Cuba with your
             husband?

                        ISABELLA
             I never do business in Cuba.
                  (beat)
             And nobody goes to Cuba but me.
                  (smiles)
             And he is not my husband...

   Crockett's surprised.  And he doesn't push it.

                        CROCKETT
             Were you born in Havana?

                        ISABELLA
             Angola.  My mother was being a
             surgeon there.  She volunteered.
             Mozambique and Mali, too...
                  (over the wind)
             ...those days, in those days...she
             was part of Cuba's gift to the
             third world.  She came from a
             bourgeois family with a house in
             Verdado...we still have the house.
             We will go there...

                        CROCKETT
             Where's she now?

                        ISABELLA
             She's dead...

   Crockett looks at her.  Her perspective is that of the '60's
   and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the
   perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon.

                        CROCKETT
             Your father?

                        ISABELLA
             Angolan Military.  Went back to the
             fighting.  Disappeared.  Who
             knows...?

   Isabella looks at the look on Crockett's face.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             Go ahead and ask...

                        CROCKETT
             How's he not your husband?

                        ISABELLA
             I am no one's wife.  I live in my
             own house.  I do not live in a
             man's house.  He has a wife.  We
             are together.  I am free.  Because
             of banking and finance and travel...
                  (looks at him, shouts over
                   wind)
             And I can do anything I want...

   She laughs.  She has that combination of intellect, beauty
   and youth.  Everything is possible...life will never
   end...she can ride this crest eternally.

   And Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to
   peril, makes "right now" too real because she believes she
   will live forever.

   CROCKETT

   can't help it.  He looks right at her.  She lifts her face to
   the spray.  Some clouds part and light strikes her...

   And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.  He wants
   no one else to have her.  He wants no harm to come to her.
   And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who
   he is.  And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn
   away...

   ISABELLA

   sees this.  She's quizzical.  Crockett looks back at her.
   Their eyes connect.

   "BORN TO WIN"

   leaps...

   CROCKETT

   his left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel.
   She rocks back against his body.  They rip across the seas...

   INT. "JAZZ" - A HAVANA NIGHTCLUB JAMMED WITH PEOPLE - NIGHT

   14-piece Afro-Cuban band.  IN THE PRESS OF dancers at a small

                  (shouts over noise)

             Later!  Do you dance?

                        CROCKETT
             I dance...

   They move into the crowd under two-story high windows
   overlooking Meyer Lansky's Hotel Riviera - freeze-dried 1959
   Las Vegas.

   CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   Whatever we knew about Sonny Crockett, we did not know he
   could dance.  Their feet, their knees and thighs, perfectly
   matched, they samba, like lightning.

   He swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as
   their hips and legs parallel each other's, as he turns her
   under his arm, stops her, pulls her backwards into his body,
   her hips into his, the fast beat, the footwork, and he spins
   her back facing him, pressing her closer as it gets faster
   and...

   INT. BEDROOM - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   fall onto a bed, shedding the last of their clothes, making
   love in a house somewhere.  Beyond them is an open window to
   the ocean.  The sky turns red and grey but the water stays
   molten.

   Their eyes are open...because they're locked together the
   whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised
   because this is not language; not a symbol, not a
   representation of a thing.  Jesus Montoya is not here.  Miami
   is not here.  This is discovery.  This is fact.  They have
   discovered each other and have never felt like this about
   anyone before in their lives.

   INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - CROCKETT - MORNING

   His eyes open.  He wakes up.  Light and situation flood in.
   He does not know where he is.  He pulls on his pants.
   Barefoot, he walks to the window.  The interior is high-
   ceilinged with immaculately polished floors.  And Crockett
   looks around, a stranger in a stranger place.

   EXT. THE BALCONY - CROCKETT

   enters.  The paint on the outside of this house is peeling
   and patinaed with stain.  The yard is overgrown.  The stucco
   fence around the streamline deco facade is crumbling from
   weather and time...

   CROCKETT WATCHES THE OCEAN

   from the balcony of the futuristic villa in Verdado...  A
   futurism from 1939, peeling aqua, aging science fiction.
   Wherever we are in the world, this place is out of the
   stream, outside history.  And Isabella, this woman from a
   different world, enters, brings him an oversized cup of
   coffee.  In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her
   shoulders and they stand in the air.

   CROCKETT

   hears voices from the interior.

                        ISABELLA
             My aunt.  She's ancient.  She looks
             after the place...

             This was my mother's family's

   INT. BODEGUITA DEL MEDIO - CROCKETT + ISABELLA - AFTERNOON

   in the funky yellow restaurant drinking mojitas.  They've had
   lunch served to them at the bar.  Frosted glasses have sugar
   on the bottom and are loaded with crushed Cuban herbs.  The
   bartender has been there for 40 years.  Crockett and Isabella
   look like regulars.  They've served chicken and plantains.
   Like any restaurant, the people eating at the bar are the
   regulars.  They sit where Hemingway sat in the slow part of
   the afternoon.

                        ISABELLA
             Tell me everything.

             No.

                        ISABELLA
             I insist.

                        CROCKETT
                  (flip)
             Okay.
                  (beat)
             Macon, Georgia is where I was born.
             Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I
             was 14.  Then the military.  Then
             prison.  Because I was dumb and
             angry.  Then I read.  Then I got
             smart.  Then I discovered what I
             know, now...it's all business...

   Isabella smiles.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
                  (to Bartender)
             My friend, two more.
                  (beat)
             What was your mother's name...?

                        ISABELLA
             Blanca...a rubio like you.
                  (pause)
             I see her in a dress...an old
             photograph from Lucinda somebody's
             wedding...everybody is with
             couples.  Husbands and wives.  They
             all pose.  My mother is alone
             because my father had to go back to
             the fighting.
                  (she points)
             ...she looks right into the camera.
             She is the most beautiful woman in
             the room.  By herself.  In a party
             dress.  And she looked like she
             knew she would die alone...
                  (beat...remembers)
             She spoke many languages.  We were
             in Luanda when she died.  I went to
             her friends in Mali.  They sent me
             to the Ecole Polytechnique in
             Geneva to study mathematics, where
             I met Montoya in the discos.  He
             had banking there...I was seventeen
             and very much into the clubs.  And
             he sent me to University for an MBA
             in Finance.
                  (pause)
             Your mother?

                        CROCKETT
             Died in childbirth, having me...

                        ISABELLA
             To mothers.  And all that we owe
             them...

   Isabella looks at Crockett and smiles and puts on her
   sunglasses.

                        CROCKETT
             You know how improbable this is...?

                        ISABELLA
             "Probable"...applies to an event
             that may be real.  Doesn't apply
             here.

                        CROCKETT
             ...'cause we have no future...are
             of today and not tomorrow.

                        ISABELLA
                  (laughs)
             That's right.

                        CROCKETT
             ...and therafore there is no
             consequence?

                        ISABELLA
             Exactly.

   Crockett's hand is around her waist and slips down her hip as
   he pulls her closer and takes off her glasses and she puts
   down her drink and kisses him at the bar and Crockett's eyes
   dwell on her and she looks back at him and, now, knowing what
   he's thinking...

   INT. THE STREAMLINE HOUSE IN VEDADO - LEADEN SKIES - LATE
   AFTERNOON

   The water is like sheet metal as clouds allow only a sliver
   of light to illuminate the sea while rain greys-out most of
   it.  Minute crimson is a freighter heading to the stone
   harbor.  Fabric billows in the wind.  PULL BACK into the room
   to Crockett and Isabella...

   TWO NAKED BODIES

   ...one light skinned, the other brown, intertwine in the
   opiated moments after sensuality.  The afternoon half-light
   drapes parts of their bodies, making a relief against which
   their eyes hold each other's...

   event of her in memory so she'll sustain there, because he
   compels himself to a different place, now.  Then, the shower
   curtain parts.  It startles him...

   ISABELLA

   enters.  She touches his back.  He turns to her with a smile.

                        CROCKETT
                  (soft)
             Let's talk deliveries.

   Isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce.  She
   merely goes there, too.  After all, this is their subject.
   Soft smiles.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             ...and a different kind of deal.

                        ISABELLA
             Like...?

                        CROCKETT
             Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's
             nice.
             And I can supply the transportation
             into South Florida and the Gulf,
             more reliable and on-time than
             FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK
             for openers.

                        ISABELLA
             And why should continuing
             excellence cost more?

                        CROCKETT
             Cost less.  That's the point.

                        ISABELLA
             Is it December?

                        CROCKETT
             What do you mean?

                        ISABELLA
             Did Christmas come early this
             year...?

                        CROCKETT
             Better than that.
                  (beat)
             We become partners.  Only in this
             territory and only on loads we run.
             And you don't pay us three thousand
             a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we
             get is thirty percent of the load.
             Product or cash.  "And why," you're
             thinking, "would I be crazy enough
             to out in these gringos like that?
             Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love?
             Too many mojitas?"  And the answer
             is, "of course" but also "no.  It
             is because Sonny can deliver what
             no one else can."

                        ISABELLA

             Zero risk.

                        ISABELLA
             'Cause you don't lose loads?

                        CROCKETT
             'Cause we guarantee every load.
                  (beat)
             Anywhere, for any reason, it comes
             up short, we make good.  Your
             operations will, from now on, run
             risk-free.

                        ISABELLA
             And you're our thirty-percent
             partner?

   Her knowing smile speaks of experience beyond her years.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
                  (deadly seriously)
             What if I tell you that your ideas
             are too big for your skin?
                  (beat)
             That merely to propose this is a
             dangerous thing?

                        CROCKETT
             Then I would say to you, this has
             been fun...

   There's a long pause.  This is business.  This is what is.

                        ISABELLA
             The range should be between fifteen
             and seventeen-point-five percent of
             the P.O.E....to even consider it.

                        CROCKETT
             I need thirty.  Calculate in, also,
             the cash you don't have to front...

                        ISABELLA
             Available cash is not an issue for
             us...

                        CROCKETT
             Twenty-eight-point-five.

                        ISABELLA
             What if I pushed to twenty-one...?

                        CROCKETT
             I would say you're...
                  (hesitates; holds up four
                   fingers)
             ...four percentage points away from
             a deal...

                        ISABELLA
             Maybe I'm only one.

   And she slides into his arms.  And smiles...

                        CROCKETT
             We'll do it at twenty-two...

   Isabella laughs.  She kisses him under the shower water.  And
   it's tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the
   edge.

                        CROCKETT (cont'd)
             ...and now what?

                        ISABELLA
             And now I make you breakfast
             again...

   Her breathing is heavier as she buries her head in his neck.

   Crockett disconnects.  He pushes it.  It launches from one
   swell, airborne, and knifes into the next.  It's violent.
   Crockett's thoughts and expression are about Isabella.  They
   are criminal conspirators, a woman cheating on her
   narcotrafficker "husband," an outlaw smuggler who's really an
   undercover cop...

   methods, nevertheless...

                  (to Fujima)
             Change the mission statement.
             Crockett stays in.  He keeps
             working up the ladder.  The
             local importers get a pass for the
             time being.

                        TUBBS

   This is the answer Crockett needed to hear.

   small forest of satellite dishes.  A ribbon of white-sand and

   futuristic at the same time.

   sweatsuit is Isabella, delivering a financial report.  It's
   from memory.  Nothing is written down, in the tradition of
   the elite section of Swiss private banking in which clerks
   commit portfolios to memory.  There are no documents.

                        ISABELLA
             ...and we're looking at Nigerian
             crude...

             They've been targeted.  And
             Pakistani registry is too
             vulnerable to search and seizure
             right now.

                        MONTOYA
             José doesn't like the deal in South
             Florida...

   Montoya's referring to Crockett.  Alarm bells go off.

                        ISABELLA
                  (cuts in)
             Burnett?
                  (shrugs)
             They want 22% of the value on loads
             they run into South Florida.  It's
             the Juarez cartel model.
             They guarantee the loads.  The
             upside is our risk goes to zero.
             That frees-up capital.

                        MONTOYA
             But what does your intuition tell
             you...?

   Is he suspicious?  Does he suspect Isabella and Crockett are
   lovers?

                        ISABELLA
             My "intuition"...?  My intuition
             made him breakfast the other
             morning in Havana.

   Her lieson with Crockett is the last thing we expected to
   hear from Isabella.

                        MONTOYA
             And...?

                        ISABELLA
             They're serious.  They're cautious.
             They'll forgo a deal over a
             technicality of how a delivery's
             handled...they'd walk away, rather
             than compromise operational
             security...that's good.

   Montoya's thoughtful.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             But they have to be watched
             closely...

                        MONTOYA
             Why?

                        ISABELLA
             A good deal, like this with us, for
             Burnett will be good only
             temporarily.  He'll get restless
             because he believes nothing is
             forever.  Life is dust, make it
             while you can.  He's ambitious.

   Montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             So I predict a few good runs.  Then
             there'll be a renegotiation.

                        MONTOYA
             That's my girl...

   Montoya uses Isabella and her sexual allure to gather insight
   into the people he does business with.  That's part of their
   deal.

                        MONTOYA (cont'd)
             On the next load, José wants to
             front them silver.  But they them in

             He thinks they are wrong.  What do
             you think?

                        ISABELLA
                  (revealing nothing)
             I think José suspects anybody he
             doesn't intimidate.  And people,
             who are good at what they do?  They
             have egos, too...

                        MONTOYA
                  (careful)
             What would you do...?

                        ISABELLA
                  (equally careful)
             I like the diminished risk.  It
             frees up capital reserves.  I like
             working with self-interested
             businessmen who are competent.  You
             can predict their behavior....

   Montoya looks at her very carefully.  She stares right back
   at him.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             On the other hand...if what you
             wish, mi corazon, is la
             plumba...the lead?  Then let's do
             that.  Accept their deal.  After
             the load is received...we will
             close their eyes forever...

   She looks at Montoya squarely.  It hangs in the air.  In his
   strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a
   conclusion...

                        MONTOYA
              Let's try a few runs with these
              partners, I think.  I will tell
              José...

   If Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it.  Montoya
   continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in
   stone.  He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes.

   He reaches for her hand and brings her to him.  She kisses
   him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his
   neck, and she runs her hands down him...

   searches, looking for someone as she descends the ramp.
   Then...

   CROCKETT

   emerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane.

   ISABELLA'S

   expression changes, but she masks it.

   Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac.  There are two
   Suburbans.  One for her; one full of security.  Crockett and
   her meet.  No show of affection.  Her Secretary, carrying her
   briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban.

   INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - DOOR - NIGHT

   opens.  Crockett and Isabella climb in.  The rear is
   customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and
   a divider.  As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she
   takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride
   in the front vehicle.  Doors close.  Windows go up.  Air
   conditioning comes on.  She raises the divider, blocking the
   driver and locks the doors.  They are sealed in the back.
   Alone.  And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's
   desperate...as if making love to him puts her world back in
   balance.  Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses...

                        CROCKETT
             Hola, chica.

                        ISABELLA

   He touches the side of her face.

   Yero shakes Gina's hand.  He indicates to the bartender that

   an office.  Cobalt blue light illuminates his face, and his
   fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality.

   He watches them, too.  His yellow eyes are lit by strobes.

   with Switek and Zito.  Trudy's in a tank top.  José looks at
   Trudy appreciatively...

   TRUDY

   returns the look with a stare that says, "Don't fuck with
   me".  José raises his eyebrow and after noting the two
   handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers...

   INT. LONG CARGO SHED - JOSÉ YERO + EL TIBURON

   walk.  Cochi Loco's security leads and tails behind as...

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (to El Tiburon)
             You know what Escobar used to do?

                        EL TIBURON
             What?

                        JOSÉ YERO
                  (goes on)
             In the '80's, air routes came into
             favor.  It required many pilots.
             The best were American.  Former
             crop-dusters.  They didn't fly by
             the book.  Tell one:  "Put that 747
             down on this fifteen-hundred-foot
             runway."  Somehow, he'd do it.
             Great pilots.  But Pablo had a
             rule.  After they flew six
             loads...this good pilot who
             facilitates so much good
             business... he would come back to
             Medellín or Barranquilla to pick up
             the next load?
                  (beat)
             And no one would ever see him
             again.  He'd disappear.
                  (imitates Pablo)
             "You a good pilot?
             Make a lot of money for Pablo?
             Thank you very much."  And then
             Pablo would kill his ass.  After
             six loads.
                  (pause)
             And who was Pablo Escobar?  A
             provincial who got busted-out by
             the white collars from Cali.  When
             the gringos got him, he was nobody.
             We're three times better than Pablo
             Escobar.
                  (beat)
             The means we kill these
             sonsabitches three times sooner.
                  (beat)
             And do you know why Pablo Escobar
             did that?

                        EL TIBURON
             Why?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             He didn't like pilots.

   EXT. BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, CARGO SHED - JOSÉ YERO + EL TIBURON

   YERO POV:  GINA

   passes by, driven by Switek.  They're en route to pick up
   Tubbs.

                        JOSÉ YERO (CONT'D)
             And put eyes on her.  Put eyes on
             her twenty-four hours a day...

   EXT. BARRANQUILLA BEACH - CROCKETT + ISABELLA, TUBBS + GINA -
   NIGHT

   Isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around
   cooked rice and barbecued pork.  Gina and Tubbs walk away
   down the beach towards phosphorescent waves.

                        ISABELLA
             I forgot the napkins.

                        CROCKETT
             And the chopsticks and fortune
             cookies?

                        ISABELLA
             What's the best fortune you ever
             got?

                        CROCKETT
             They're all the same.  "Financial
             security is around the corner."
             "Your friends love you."

                        ISABELLA
             In Kowloon, once, I got one that
             said, "Live now because life is
             dust."

   Crockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the
   ebb tide.

                        CROCKETT
             Do you have assets somewhere else?
             Bank accounts?

                        ISABELLA
             Why?

                        CROCKETT
             ...to fall back on.  You know, a
             fail-safe.  Insurance.

                        ISABELLA
             Do I need it?

                        CROCKETT
                  (shrugs)
             Everybody needs it.  Ask
             Prudential.  Or Allstate.

                        ISABELLA
                  (laughs)
             'Cause whatever can go wrong,
             will...?

   The Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the
   Fourth of July.

                        CROCKETT
             Something like that.  The odds
             catch up with you.  The odds are
             like gravity.  You can't negotiate
             with them.
                  (then)
             So...at some point, you should cash
             out, take your money and run...

                        ISABELLA
                  (smiles)
             Really?

                        CROCKETT
             Sure.  As far away and as fast as
             you can.

                        ISABELLA
             When?

                        CROCKETT
             Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe
             sooner.

   What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her?

                        ISABELLA
             Would you find me...?

                        CROCKETT
             Of course.

                        ISABELLA
             Where would I go?

                        CROCKETT
             Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands.
             Somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
             There's twelve-hundred islands
             there...

                        ISABELLA
                  (smiles)
             Is this the protective male talk?

                        CROCKETT
                  (deadly serious)
             This is the talk of a man...if he
             were your husband...he would never
             put you at risk.  He would never
             put you within a thousand miles of
             anything that could hurt you.

                        ISABELLA
             And if I were in the Comoros, in
             the Indian Ocean, where would you
             be...?

                        CROCKETT
             A few more moments, still in this
             business.  Then I'd find you.

                        ISABELLA
             Would you?  Because if you
             couldn't, I would be very lonely...
             I would have left the only world I
             know and have known since I was
             seventeen.
                  (smiles, touches Crockett)
             But none of this will happen.  So
             it doesn't matter.  Because we are
             on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all
             you see around you...look around...
             is Archangel de Jesus Montoya-
             Londono.  He is my man.  And you are
             a smuggler moving a load...

   Her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will
   disregard them.  Life is dust.  Meaning is in the moment, and
   that's right now.

   The intensity is because it's impossible.  Because it's
   impossible, they've been free to imagine.  And that's made
   the heat of it stronger...

                        CROCKETT
             ...in the morning.

                        ISABELLA
             I'll be on board by noon.

   Crockett didn't expect that.

                        ISABELLA (cont'd)
             What did you think?  This deal with
             you is my deal.  I am responsible.

   She vouched for him.  She has to stand behind it.  He puts
   his arm around her waist.

   INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER, BRIDGE - TRUDY + CROCKETT - DAWN

   The Freighter is anchored a half mile offshore.

   Magenta breaks the horizon.  Trudy looks at Crockett, looks
   away...

                        CROCKETT
             Go ahead.

                        TRUDY
             Too fast.  Too many moving parts.

                        CROCKETT
             Switek?

   Zito joins them.

                        SWITEK
             Same.  But it's your call, boss.

   Tubbs joins them.

                        CROCKETT
             What's your take?

                        TUBBS
             What's the point?  It's going down.

                        CROCKETT
             Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and
             arrest our ass."
                  (beat)
             And Switek resumes romancing Miss
             Ukraine...

   Crockett looks at Trudy.  There's a connection between
   Crockett and Trudy.  It's filial.  Crockett has a special
   regard for her judgment.

                        TRUDY
             If we were for real, and knew our
             shit, we'd fade this one...

                        CROCKETT
             Then you should.

                        TRUDY

   EXT. SAFE HOUSE ON THE INDIAN RIVER - GINA - NIGHT

   drives up.  Parks.  She approaches along the sidewalk, down
   the walkway under the banana trees and birds of paradise.

   Motion sensors trigger exterior lights.  Gina cocks her ear,
   waiting to hear...  Then, offscreen, Tommy the dog barks.
   Reassured, her left hand on her .380, she reaches for her
   keys, opens the door...

   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GHETTO BLASTER

   A finger pushed the stop button.  The dog stops barking.

   OVERHEAD:  ENTRY WAY - GINA

   enters.

   FROM BEHIND HER - WE MOVE CLOSER AS...

   a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left
   shoulder, paralyzing her arm.  Other arms grab her, push her
   head down.  The same sap backhands with massive force across
   the back of her neck...

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - ECU:  GINA - NIGHT

   slowly comes to consciousness.  She looks around,
   disoriented.  Her eyes roll back in her head and she slips
   into dreamland for a moment.  She rouses and opens her eyes
   again, blinks, disoriented...

   WIDE PAST GINA TO WHICH SHE SEES:  AN EMACIATED WOMAN IN A
   PLAID HOUSEDRESS

   stares at her from the back corner of the double-wide
   trailer.  With her is an overweight autistic Boy of about 11.
   He plays in the corner and watches a small TV with a coat
   hanger for an antenna.  The Old Woman pays Gina no attention
   On her face is zero affect.  There are other sounds in the
   room.

   WIDER:  GINA

   and we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor.
   Her clothes are disheveled and ripped.  She tries to focus.
   Then somebody's thick arms are fitting something around her
   neck.  A blindfold goes over her eyes.  Around her neck is a
   C-4 "necklace" like the one we saw on Stevens' wife in the
   beginning of the film.  The arms and back belong to the deep-
   chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and
   Coleman's double-wide.  MOVE IN ON GINA.  He reaches below
   the frame and does something.  Gina writhes away from him in
   the chair.  He laughs.  He backs away from her to
   camera...and holds something in his hand.

   A CAMERA

   He takes a digital picture.

   A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the
   road.  Neighbors are double-wide trailers.  The house has
   some sophisticated radio antennas as well as a twelve-foot
   satellite dish.  On the driveway are two Escalades and a
   Bentley.  Out the back, off the dock is a two-million dollar
   sports/fishing boat.  Someone's entering numbers on a cell
   phone.

   INT. HOMESTEAD FLORIDA TRACT HOUSE - COLEMAN

   waits.  The guy working the cell phone is the buzz-cut Aryan
   Brother we saw in the Stevens kitchen in the opening.
   Coleman's shirt open in the Barcalounger watching ESPN.  His
   watch is loaded with ice, and a four-carat diamond in his
   ear.  He is all white bling.  Coleman's tattooed up.  Not
   with "cool" Celtic symbols...his tats are neo-Nazi, white
   supremacist, hard-core prison stuff.

   CELL PHONE

   in the hands of the deep-chested Aryan Brother.  Three girls
   in cutoffs and halters are making sandwiches and laughing in
   the b.g..  Then:

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             El Tiburon.

   Coleman takes the satellite phone, attached to a laptop.  He
   enters a number.  A frequency-response graphic displays in
   the computer.  His conversation with El Tiburon is encrypted

             I confess I have succumbed to my
             weaknesses.  An inability to see
             another's point of view.
                  (beat)
             I've discussed it with

   Crockett puts him on speaker.

             So I want you to deliver my

   Isabella walks in.  Crockett gestures for her to be quiet.

             Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She
             is safe.  To insure that, I am
             keeping her close to me.  It's
             always good to keep people your
             friends care about close to you.

   Tubbs reaches for the phone.  Trudy intercepts him.

   Crockett turns it away and goes off the speaker...

                        JOSÉ YERO (cont'd)
             So, I will tell you when you're 10
             minutes out where to drop the load
             into the hands of my people.  You
             have 35 minutes to enter Government
             Channel.  Head up the River...  We
             will watch you.  Then I will call
             you.
                  (beat)
             And you can reach out for La Senora
             in Barranquilla or wherever 'cause
             I don't give a shit...

   José Yero does NOT know Isabella's on board.

                        CROCKETT
             Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs.
             Rico's alive?

                        JOSÉ YERO
             'Cause she will tell you.

   He hangs up.

                        ISABELLA
             That sonofabitch!

                        TUBBS
                  (turns on Isabella)
             You set this up!

                        ISABELLA
                  (sarcastic)
             Of course!  That is why I placed
             myself here, with you, knowing Yero
             would pull this crap.

                        CROCKETT
             Yero doesn't know she's here!

   Crockett looks at Isabella, who's distracted in calculating
   what's really happening.

                        SWITEK
                  (entering)
             Cigarette and the two Starkeys are

             What...?

                        TRUDY
             They grabbed Gina...

   Isabella punches numbers into a satellite phone.  No results.

                        ISABELLA
             It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of
             communication in Fals de Iguazu.
             José knows that...  Whatever he's
             going to do, he has to do it fast
             because he's acting on his own.
             And he will need a story.

                        TUBBS
             Meaning...?

                        ISABELLA
             They will kill you.  And then they
             will kill your wife, too.

                        CROCKETT
             Yero, by himself?

                        ISABELLA
             Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy
             whites.

   Zito enters, makes the situation...

                        ZITO
             We're half loaded...

                        TRUDY
             Gina.  Like Alonzo's wife...  Cochi
             Loco's got her.

                        CROCKETT
             Dump the rest.  Let's get the boats
             up that river.

   Crockett picks up the phone and dials.  His eyes contact with
   Tubbs has Tubbs take Isabella out of the Captain's Bridge.
   She pulls her arm away.  As they head down from the
   bridge...we see...

   EXT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - DOPE-ON-A-ROPE

   lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.  The fuel
   bladders with crampons slide down the rope into the smaller
   "cigarette" boats..."dope-on-a-rope."

   WIDER:  ONE STARKEY

   loaded, takes off into the night, no lights.  A second one
   pulls away as the third boat's being loaded; Switek and Zito
   climb into a cigarette.  Meanwhile...

             Yeah?

                        CROCKETT
             José Yero changed-up the drop plan
             on us.  He's grabbed Gina.

                        CASTILLO
             Where's the new drop point...?

                        CROCKETT
             They'll have surveillance on us.
             We'll know only at the last
             moment...

                        CASTILLO
             What do you think?

                        CROCKETT
             It's a rip and a hit.

                        CASTILLO
                  (to someone else)
             Get me Air Support...
                  (to Crockett)
             We'll be airborne and assault the
             ambush...

                        CROCKETT
             You can't.

                        TUBBS
             They'll kill Gina.

                        CASTILLO
             They may have already, so we
             protect the living.  Proof she's
             alive?

                        CROCKETT
             Supposedly it's coming.

   INT. SCARAB - SWITEK, ZITO + TRUDY

   rip from one swell to another, airborne, in between their
   load.  Trudy's on the comms.  Switek drives with night-vision
   gear.

   INT. STRYKER - CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA

   Crockett drives.  Tubbs is on the throttles.  Isabella's
   between them.  Then, Tubbs is sent a page.  Reads the number.
   Picks up the satellite phone.  Crockett takes control of the
   throttles, too.

                        TUBBS
                  (into phone)
             Hello...?

   And Tubbs hears..."And weather on the southeast throughout
   today and looking into the weekend is broken clouds, humidity
   78%, small chance of rain.  And coming up in four minutes at
   5:45 is Lou Dobbs with Friday's market previews..."

                        LOU DOBBS (O.S.)
             Welcome, folks.  Today's Friday,
             the three-hundredth-and-fourteenth
             day of the year...

                        TUBBS
             They're proving it's right now.
             And that she's alive right now...

                        GINA (O.S.)
             ...nice friends you got.  Trailer
             trash with a bad smell...

   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - GINA - NIGHT

   The phone is ripped away from her.  It's disconnected.

             She's allergic to diethylene...she
             in a meth lab?

   Crockett takes the phone, dials Castillo.

                        CROCKETT
             Just came in.  She's still alive.

                        CASTILLO
             Safe house is empty...
                  (beat)
             Air Support's set to jump when we
             know your drop point.  Gina?

                        TUBBS
                  (takes phone)
             She's sending a message.  Meth Lab.
             Trailer park.  Anything with
             interesting antenna arrays...?

                        CASTILLO
             There's three between Miami
             International and the glades.  I'm
             gonna try for her, but this is
             triage.  Protect the maximum number
             of lives.  You need to know that...

   Crockett knows the Sophie's choice Castillo may have to make.
   And it may cost Gina.  Crockett glances at Tubbs.  Crockett
   pushes the throttles forward...

   EXT. GOVERNMENT CHANNEL - TWO BOATS:  THE SCARAB + THE
   STRYKER

   jam over the swells into Government Channel, NOT SLOWING this
   time, even though the limit is 15 knots.  Barely missing
   sport fishing boats, slower recreational craft.

   INT. SCARAB - SWITEK

   slams the Scarab sideways, spewing a huge wake, driving it
   through a circle to slough off speed as he pulls into a dock.
   Crockett's Stryker does the same.  Tubbs transfers into this
   boat with Trudy and Zito.  Switek gets into the Stryker with
   Crockett and Isabella.  As they speed up Government Channel.

   RAGES INTO THE MIDDLE GROUND, CALLING DOWN JOSÉ YERO.
   BLOCKED BY AN ARYAN BROTHER, SHE PUSHES, HE SLAPS HER, SHE
   SHOOTS HIM IN THE LEG.  ALL SIDES DRAW DOWN IMPENDING CHAOS.
   CROCKETT + COLEMAN COOL IT.  COLEMAN WANTS HIS LOAD.  THE
   LURE OF EASY MONEY HAS A VERY STRONG APPEAL.

   the wall.

   EXT. TRAILER PARK, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - OVER TRUDY

   And Trudy and we SEE in fish-eye a long-haired Nazi Low-Rider
   and the bulked-out Brother with the Hefty garbage-bag apron.
   Deeper in the trailer, her clothes torn, blindfolded, is Gina
   with the C-4 necklace.  Beyond her, the woman in the house
   dress and her large, retarded son.

   Too late.  Door's opened.

   EXT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - TUBBS,

   holding the bag of Chinese for the Long-Haired NLR.  He
   reaches and...

   TUBBS

   rips Long-Hair through the door, down the stairs, where two
   SWAT slam him into the ground.  He struggles.  A baton slams
   twice across the back of his neck.  He's out.  Handcuffed,
   and Tubbs and Trudy are in the interior...

   INT. METH LAB, DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER

                        TUBBS
             HOLD IT!!

   Bulked-out Aryan has a handgun in one hand, detonator in the
   other.  Eyes wide.  Standoff.  The Old Woman in house dress
   is SCREAMING...  Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat
   to his mother...grabs butcher knife...rushes forward
   during...

                        TRUDY
             PUT DOWN THE DETONATOR!

   FROZEN.  Aryan doesn't move.  The FARQ-like necklace of C-4
   around Gina's neck.

   GINA

   struggles against plastic ties, to hear, to see, as...

   OBESE SON

   shouts, surges past bulky Aryan, heading for Tubbs...

   TUBBS

   prepares for the autistic son, not seeing behind him...

   ARYAN BROTHER #3

   rising from a bare mattress with an aluminum baseball bat,
   coming up behind Tubbs.

   WIDE - TUBBS

   slips the Autistic Son, rotating his right arm around the
   kid's right arm, getting slashed on the back of his forearm,
   but grabbing the Son's wrist as the momentum propels him past
   Tubbs, who torques the wrist back.  Screaming, Son's ruined
   wrist, Tubbs took the knife, and as the Aryan Brother swings
   the bat...

   LOW ANGLE:  TUBBS

   ducks the bat.  It dents the faux-wood paneling.  Tubbs slams
   the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving
   the AB Brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10-inch butcher
   knife through his kidney into his right lung...  AND Tubbs'
   gun in his left hand has never moved off-target of the Aryan
   brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until
   right now:  he snaps a ROUND into the wounded Aryan Brother's
   head.  And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target.

   AND THE FIERCE EYES OF BULKED-OUT BROTHER

   A nihilistic smile dawns there.

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Shoot me, she dies.  Hey, fuck it,
             man.  We can all go.

             between your upper lip and the

                        ARYAN BROTHER
             Fuck...

   BLAM.  That's all he gets out.  Trudy does exactly that.
   Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree.  Tubbs retrieves the
   detonator.  Trudy unties Gina.  Carefully, Tubbs pulls the
   sensitive remote detonator from his hands.

   TUBBS

   puts his coat over Gina.  As she half leaves, turns to the
   fallen AB...

                        GINA

   She kicks him in the head.  Tubbs grabs her to pull her off.

   BRIGHT LIGHT freezes it...heavy rounds slam into the engine,
   crack the block, stream sprays, it seizes up.  Suburban
   crashes into a car at the curb.  Yero bails out.

   EXT. SKY - HELICOPTER - TUBBS

   half out of his seat, a Galil in full auto on his shoulder,
   hovering above Yero and the Suburban.

                        PA
                  (loud hailer)
             Freeze!  You're under arrest.  Down
             on your knees.  Put your hands on
             your head...

   CLOSE:  YERO

   does none of that.  Enraged, he pulls up a 9mm H+K SMG to
   fire up at the helicopter

   ON TUBBS

   aiming down at CAM.  The assault rifle unloads in three-shot
   bursts.

   OVER TUBBS DOWN TO YERO IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT

   The pavement, the car and Yero are cratered by the 7.62mm
   rounds.  Yero goes down.  Dead.

   EXT. STREET - WIDE:  HELICOPTER

   lands.  Tubbs bails, grabbing his duffle bag and the rifle and
   turns down the street towards the firefight and Crockett...

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. JETTY - CROCKETT

   holding Isabella down, FIRES past a Toyota.  It's turned into
   a sieve.  He tells Isabella to stay behind the engine block.
   Then he ASSAULTS the ambush.

   SWITEK

   is shot in the calf, spins, goes down, gets up, limps to
   cover, keeps firing.

   EXT. SCRAP FREIGHTER - COLEMAN

   ...taking and returning FIRE from Crockett and Zito and from
   his left flank from the SWAT team on the bridge...knows every
   moment more he's here, more MPD assets are coming in.  He
   wants to finish it faster.

   LOW + WIDE:  COLEMAN

   bails off the freighter onto the dock.  DARK-HAIRED ARYAN
   BROTHER with a full auto AK is with him.  They move from
   cover to cover, their heavy Kevlar body armor absorbing
   rounds.  And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are
   outgunned.

   CROCKETT + ZITO

   run for cover, fire three-shot bursts, run and cover.  But...

   ISABELLA

   runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the
   crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero.  She's shouting
   in Spanish.  It's insane.

   CROCKETT

   sees Isabella, moves.

   COLEMAN

   sees Isabella, swings his assault rifle onto her as...

                        CROCKETT
             Isabella!!

   CROCKETT RUNS

   and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs
   and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under
   him.  Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to
   kill Isabella.  Dark-Haired NLR is pulling the trigger on
   Crockett when BOOM...

   TUBBS

   fires the M40 grenade launcher loaded with shot.  Dark-Haired
   NLR is nearly cut in half.

   CROCKETT + ZITO

   FIRE at the prone Coleman.  Coleman's dead.

   WIDER:  THE FREIGHTERS - THE FIREFIGHT

   continues as other NLR battle Miami SWAT.  Meanwhile...

   CROCKETT

   goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from
   dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police.
   OK, how will they get out of here?

   OVER CROCKETT + ISABELLA:  TUBBS

   approaches from the left.  Tubbs and Crockett's eyes connect.

   CLOSER:  TUBBS

   sees his partner with this woman.  The frozen moment.
   Isabella doesn't understand the changed expression on Tubbs'
   face.  We do.

   CROCKETT EYE TO EYE WITH HIS PARTNER

   50 yards away.  All meaning is transmitted.  And Tubbs
   nods...and the nod means:  "get her out of here..."

   As Tubbs speaks into his radio, his right arm belted where it
   was slashed, heading towards the diminished firefight, now
   under MPD control, as...

   CROCKETT RACES ISABELLA AWAY

   through the weeds and scrap, away from the firefight, away
   from the freighters, AWAY FROM THE POLICE.  Beyond them, we
   hear the gunfight diminishing.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. STREET - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   enter from the rubble-filled industrial lot.  Cars have
   stopped, their occupants seeking cover behind them.  Crockett
   hesitates not at all.  He grabs a late '80's Mercedes left
   with its door open.  Its owner, a middle-aged man at the
   curb, starts to object.  Crockett raises his gun.  Owner
   demurs.  Crockett steals away in it down the street into the
   night, its lights off.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + ISABELLA

   breathing.  She's hyperventilating.  He steadies her.  Then,
   Crockett sees something and she does, too.

   CROCKETT'S POV:  A ROADBLOCK

   appears around the corner.  Rearview mirror:  flashing lights
   on his tail.  Nowhere to go.  Crockett stops.

   ISABELLA

   thinks this is it.  She's dead.  SWAT, shotguns and assault
   rifles, approach.

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT

                        CROCKETT
             Touch the windshield with your
             hands.  Let 'em see your hands are
             empty.  Steady.

                        SWAT SERGEANT
                  (approaching)
             Don't move!  Don't move!  Keep your
             hands where I can see them...

   They do.  Then the SWAT Sergeant stops...

                        SWAT SERGEANT (cont'd)
             ...Sonny?

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.  Hey, Robert.

   The police relax, turn away.

                        SWAT SERGEANT
             Are you okay?!

                        CROCKETT
             Yeah.  Going to Miami General.
             Check out Gina.  Everybody's okay.
             Everybody's fine...

   Crockett nods and drives through the roadblock.  He drives
   away into the night.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT

   does not look at Isabella.  He shoots up the on-ramp onto
   I-95.  His eyes at the moment are world-weary and street-
   wise.  It's all out.  All is in the open.  Finally, he looks
   over his right shoulder at her.

   ISABELLA

   stares at him.  Incredulous.  For the first time she realizes
   he's the police and has been undercover.  And now she hits
   him...

   EXT. HIGHWAY - MERCEDES

   swerves across three lanes, up on two wheels, almost rolls,
   cuts off a semi, which barely recovers, and spins out onto
   the shoulder, off the shoulder, down into the gravel.  It
   comes to a stop and...

   INT. MERCEDES - ISABELLA

   tries to bring her .380 around.  Crockett overpowers her.
   Takes the gun.  She slams him in the face with a closed fist.
   He grabs her wrists, spins her around, pushes her at the
   door, handcuffs her behind her back.

   EXT. HIGHWAY

   He floors the Mercedes.  It spins through 270 degrees,
   scattering gravel and dust, and pulls back onto the freeway,
   driving out of the city, away from Miami, out, into the
   night.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MERCEDES - LATER

   She won't look at him.  She won't reply.  She's frozen,
   immobile, withdrawn deep, darkly into herself.

                        CROCKETT
             Isabella...?

   No reply.  Isabella wonders where he's taking her, what will
   happen to her, but she won't ask.

                                                  CUT TO:

   EXT. TWO-LANE BLACKTOP THROUGH CYPRESS - NIGHT

   Nothing.  The cypress are silhouettes against a lighter mauve
   sky.  Engine sound.  Then, the Mercedes enters and speeds
   down the empty two-lane blacktop.  And at the end, the trees
   open up and there's the open ocean and, beyond that, the
   Florida Keys.  We see a house.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - WIDE:  NIGHT

   Door opens.  Crockett leads Isabella in.  He uncuffs her.
   She rips away from his hand holding her arm.  She walks to
   the other end of the large room with the picture windows
   overlooking the water and the jetty and a boat tied up there.
   Low furniture.  Sparse, it was built in the '60's.  She walks
   to a restroom, slams the door.  Offscreen, a faucet runs.

   Suddenly, the door opens.  She comes out, glaring, shouting.

                        ISABELLA
             What are you going to do with me?
             Are you taking me to jail?  You
             think I will turn into your
             informant, is that it?

                        CROCKETT
             No.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. MONTOYA COMPOUND, GUAJIRA PENINSULA - COLOMBIAN MILITARY
   + DEA TYPES - DAY

   in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows.
   It is a police action, an assault.

   REVERSE:  EMPTINESS

   It's as if no one had ever lived there.  A few papers flutter
   in the breeze from the light wind entering through the open
   doorways.  White papers against white marble against white
   walls.  A profound statement of nobody is home.  Wherever
   Montoya is, he is not here.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - CROCKETT - LATE AFTERNOON

   staring out the window at the narrow jetty.  Isabella sits,
   distantly, alone at the end.

   CLOSER:  ISABELLA

   Crockett joins her.  She's withdrawn into herself.

                        CROCKETT
             No part of it wasn't real.

                        ISABELLA
             I know.
                  (quietly)
             And now?

                        CROCKETT
             It still is.  I'm so in this, I
             don't know which way is up... All I
             know is I won't let anything bad
             happen to you.
                  (beat)
             Just like I said.
                  (beat)
             And I know we can't ever see each
             other again.  And we never will.

   Isabella sits there for a moment.  She glances at him, looks
   away.  Then...

                        ISABELLA
             You said time is luck...

   Meaning, who can tell?  There may be a time for them
   somewhere else.

                        CROCKETT
             Luck ran out.
                  (beat)
             This was too good to last.

   He touches her hand.  And she leans all her weight against
   his arm.

                                                  CUT TO:

   INT. CYPRESS HOUSE, BEDROOM - CROCKETT - LATER

   asleep.  The moonlight is silver tinged with green.  Someone
   else had been in the bed with him, but he is there alone,
   now.  Crockett wakes up.  He looks around.  She was there and
   now she's gone.

   He gets out of the bed and looks out to the ocean and the
   jetty.  The boat's gone.  She's gone.  Sonny Crockett looks
   out the window.

FADE IN:

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

A Susskind-type MODERATOR is speaking into camera:

			MODERATOR 
	Tonight we'll discuss a subject
	most of us seem to consider either
	bad taste or frivolous or funny.
	But if our experts are right, we
	face what might be called a
	masculinity crisis. Every fourth
	American man uptight, threatened by
	the increasing sexual demands of
	American women...

EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY

An IRATE WOMAN speaks into camera:

			IRATE WOMAN
	They always put it that way, but
	well, all it means, you know, is
	every fourth American woman's never
	satisfied. That's it. I never am --
	have been, you know...

EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY

A COOL WOMAN speaks into camera:

			COOL WOMAN
	This, this image of the, the man
	eating woman. It isn't our
	increasing demands. I think it's
	the shrinking American male...

EXT. SIDEWALK INTERVIEW - DAY

A SAD WOMAN speaks into camera:

			SAD WOMAN
	No, I never had, well, whatever it
	is you call it. But the hours he
	works, I can't blame him...

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY (TEXAS) - DAY

Full frame -- a scandal sheet picture of a sex-starved wife,
naked while her husband sleeps, captioned I BUY WHAT MY
HUSBAND CAN'T GIVE.

			SAD WOMAN'S VOICE 
	... but it's a problem. A big
	problem. With so many women I
	know...

Camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of
women -- rich, beautiful or naked, but all blonde -- steam
wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine. JOE BUCK grins
at the wall as he scrapes garbage.

			JOB 
	Just keep your pants on, ladies...

MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN

A LADY COMMENTATOR, gradually surrounded by lonely women...

			LADY COMMENTATOR
	Before World War One -- American
	men outnumbered women by over six
	percent. Today American women not
	only outnumber men, but live five
	years longer -- leaving them in
	control of vast corporate wealth
	and seventy-five percent of
	America's purchasing power...

The Lady Commentator is replaced by Joe, stacking dishes,
surrounded by frustrated ladies. He laughs tolerantly.

			JOE
	Y'all,line up and take your turn...

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

The Moderator smiles into camera.

			MODERATOR 
	My question is this -- will
	American know-how come up with a
	marketable male to replace all the
	men who are worrying themselves
	into an early grave over women's
	increasing sexual demands?

INT. STALL SHOWER - DAY

Joe sings as he soaps himself, "Whoopee ti yi yo, git along
little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home!"
Sound and image freeze on Joe's open mouth.

SUPERIMPOSED MAIN TITLE AND CREDITS

TITLES follow as indicated, sound and action continuing after
each credit.

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

Joe's song continues over a sweating WAITRESS, glancing up.

			WAITRESS 
	Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Wrapped in a towel, singing in front of his dresser mirror,
Joe sprays himself with deodorant, aiming a last playful
blast at the unseen crotch -- freezing song and image as
CREDITS continue over...

... a calendar girl on the wall blushing orange, mouth frozen
in a tiny O, staring wide-eyed. Joe's song continues as...

... Joe rips the wrapping from a new Stetson and sets it on
his head, freezing song and image as CREDITS continue.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

RALPH, an aging black man, faces a mountain of dirty dishes.

			RALPH
	Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Singing as he buttons his new cowboy shirt, Joe interrupts
himself to answer Ralph...

			JOE
	Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

... continuing his song as he pulls up and zips his tight
thighed black slacks, freezing song and image for CREDITS.

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME

SALLY BUCK, a pretty middle-aged blonde, smiles down at
camera,

			SALLY BUCK
	You look real nice, Joe baby...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joe sings as he pulls on his new cowboy boots, arranging his
cuffs to show off the yellow sunburst at the ankle, freezing
song and image for CREDITS.

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

The pink MANAGER scowls at his pocket watch.

			MANAGER 
	Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joe hums as he piles a complete wardrobe of cowboy clothes,
still in their wrappers, into a shiny new suitcase of black
and white horsehide.

			JOE
	Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

Holding his watch, the Manager wags a finger at camera.

			MANAGER 
	You're due here at four o'clock.
	Look at those dishes, look!

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Joe laughs as he locks his suitcase.

			JOE
	Know what you can do with those
	dishes? And if you ain't man enough
	to do it yourself, I'd be happy to
	oblige...

Joe picks up his suitcase, a portable transistor radio, walks
away from the mirror, then pauses to run a comb through his
hair, hook a cigarette at the corner of his mouth and strike
a match on his thumbnail before he turns back for one
admiring glance at himself in the mirror -- proud, exultant,
ready -- freezing the image as CREDITS END.

EXT. TEXAS TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

Joe leaves the hotel, carrying his suitcase.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

The pink Manager points at his watch angrily.

			MANAGER 
	Four to midnight, understand?

Angle widens to include Joe, holding his suitcase and radio.
Ralph stares at him curiously, stacking dishes.

			JOE
	Say, look, uh, I gotta have a word
	with you, if you got a second.

			MANAGER
	Later. Later maybe.

The Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes.

			RALPH 
	You ain't coming to work?

			JOE
	Don't guess. Just come for my day's
	pay owing and to tell you I'm
	heading East.

Joe tilts his Stetson as the Waitress appears at the door...

			WAITRESS 
	Cups!

... but she disappears without noticing Joe. Ralph offers his
hand. Joe takes it, holds it.

			RALPH 
	What you gonna do back there, East?

			JOE 
	Lotta rich women back there...

			RALPH
	Yeah?

			JOE 
	Men, they mostly faggots.

			RALPH 
	Must be some mess back there.

			JOE 
	Well, ain't no use hanging around
	here.

			RALPH
	Ain't gonna collect your pay?

			JOE 
	I got me two hundred twenty-four
	bucks of flat folding money... 
		  (slaps hip)
	He know what he can do with that
	chicken-shit day's pay. And if he
	ain't man enough to do it for
	himself, I be happy to oblige!

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

The door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY swings open and Joe appears,
measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow
employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room,
observing the drab details of the life he has left behind -
garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays,
coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on
formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping
suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke
glasses. O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this
valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the
sunshine..."

EXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

The song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria "... that
brightened our pathway a while."

			JOE 
	Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your
	chance.

From a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus
depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to
urbanize itself. The click-clack-click of his boots is loud
but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices
on the Commodity change. Joe's pace slows as he passes...

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

... a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the
sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted.
Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete
flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl
giggling sexily -- "Keep your meat hooks off my beauty
operators, sugar" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor 
- Sally Buck singing "Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird..."

... a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a
broken mirror, a FOR RENT sign in the window. Joe turns
toward the bus depot, radio pressed to his ear.

			ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	Benson and Hedges One Hundreds
	makes special awards from time to
	time for anything that's longer
	than anything...

			JOE 
	Care to get out your yardstick,
	gentlemen?

At the same moment, a recognizable variant of the "Big
Country" theme blares loud.

INTERCUT WESTERN FILM CLIP

Gary Cooper (or John Wayne) walks a frontier street.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - DAY

High angle of the departing bus, intercut "Big Country"
fashion, alternating high shots with close-ups of the bus
wheals.

EXT. FREEWAY CLOVERLEAF - DAY

Through the bus windshield -- a dizzying montage of traffic
lines, arrows and signs as the bus sweeps around and up onto
the freeway.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum
as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him
power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right
breakfast food, hair oil or automobile. Joe listens to the
humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.

			JOE
	This is a powerful mothah, ain't
	it?

Ignored by the driver, Joe rises and walks back to his empty
double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made
on his immediate fellow travelers -- an OLD LADY in front of
him -- a hostile young sailor with acne behind him -- two
teeny-boppers flirting with Joe hysterically -- a PALE BLONDE
directly across the aisle, smiling at Joe weakly.

			PALE BLONDE 
	Do you have a stick of gum?

Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick.
He watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth.

			PALE BLONDE (CONT'D)
	Thank you.

			JOE 
	Plenty more where that came from.

			PALE BLONDE 
	Thank you, no, it's just till the
	Dramamine works. I get carsick.

			JOE 
	I only get carsick on boats. 
		  (waits, then)
	But seems to me that's more the
	fish smell than the bouncing...

Joe realizes that her eyes are closed. Mildly depressed, he
stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio,
finds only static and snaps it off. Further depressed, he
examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black
head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of
tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the
flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out
match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary
cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks
apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the
roadside, watching the bus pass. Through this, leading into
the next scene, Sally Buck sings softly "... if that mocking
bird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck, relaxing in the middle of a busy day, eyes closed
wearily, while little Joe massages her neck. Her song
continues over the noises of the busy beauty parlor "... if
that golden ring turns brass, Grammaw gonna buy you a looking
glass..."

			SALLY BUCK
	No, a little lower, sugar, yeah,
	yeah, that's good. Grammaw's beat.

			SALESMAN'S VOICE 
	You gotta sell yourself, that's the
	whole trick...

INT. BUS - DAY

A seedy TRAVELING SALESMAN with badly-fitted dentures and a
frayed collar has taken the aisle seat next to Joe. As he
lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a
worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes
unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure.

			SALESMAN 
	It ain't the product and it ain't
	the price, no sir, and it ain't
	what you sell, it's personality,
	pure and simple. I ain't shined my
	own shoes or shaved my own face in
	forty years, how's that? Not bad
	for a kid that didn't pass the
	eighth grade, right?

			JOE 
	Yeah, hell, yeah.

			SALESMAN
	And that's my golden rule. Make 'em
	love you. Put yourself over and you
	can sell them anything. If they
	like you, they'll buy horsemeat for
	prime beef...

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

A gawky, adolescent Joe sits sprawled on the couch, leafing
through a magazine while Sally Buck bleaches the roots of a
young woman's hair.

			SALLY BUCK 
	You get him to the church, honey.
	He ain't gonna find out you ain't a
	real blonde till after you're
	married, then's too late.

Sally Buck turns, pretending to be stern as Toe laughs.

			SALLY BUCK (CONT'D)
	You getting too big for your
	britches, sugar.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign, painted on
the slant roof of a barn: JESUS SAVES.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Joe is alone again. The Salesman has disappeared. The bus is
dark, most-passengers trying to sleep. Only one reading light
still burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead
of Joe. Joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to
sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the
radio.

			SALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
	Don't forget to say your prayers,
	honey...

Joe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling
with the release button on her seat. She scowls as Joe leans
over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her
and turns away from him. Joe switches off her reading light.

			OLD LADY 
	I want it on.

Joe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles
back with his radio, aware of an OLD COWHAND seated opposite
him, replacing the Pale Blonde. The Old Cowhand is appraising
Joe's wardrobe curiously. He looks away when he sees Joe
watching him. Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to
open a conversation.

			EVANGELIST'S VOICE
	Oh, my friends, I say unto you,
	invest with Jesus, put your dollars
	to work where they'll pay off at
	compound interest. The Good Book
	says money answereth all things...

The Old Cowhand has rolled-himself a cigarette. Joe quickly
lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle.

			JOE 
	Light?

The Old Cowhand's "thanks" is lost in a fit of coughing as he
inhales his first drag. He settles back, wiping his watery
eyes on a faded bandana.

			EVANGELIST'S VOICE 
	... everyone who sends a dollar to
	the Evangelical Congregation of the
	Air will get free gratis a genuine
	leatherette hymn book so you can
	sing along with Sister Rosella and
	the Evangelical Choir...

			JOE
	You throw in Sister Rosella and you
	got a deal, right, old timer?

Joe glances across the aisle. The Old Cowhand manages a
faint, humorless smile.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Going far?

			OLD COWHAND 
	Up the line. Not far.

			JOE
	I'm bound for New York City.

The Old Cowhand reappraises Joe's wardrobe even more
curiously.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Ever happen to come across a cowman
	name of Woodsy Niles? Friend of my
	grammaw Sally Buck...

The Old Cowhand considers, shakes his head. Joe leans back,
laughing to himself.

INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to
the one worn by the old Cowhand. Sally Buck smiles on WOODSY
NILES -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair --
who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new
Stetson.

			SALLY BUCK 
	Like it, honey? Does it fit?

			WOODSY 
	You do me good, Sal, you do me real
	good. You know what I gonna give
	you for that Stetson?

Woodsy grabs Sally Buck, lifting her off her feet, carrying
her to the bed. Struggling, they fall across the covers
together, Little Joe laughing with them.

			SALLY BUCK 
	Woodsy Niles! The boy!

			WOODSY 
	He don't know what makes little
	apples by now, it's time he found
	out.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Joe shakes his head, grinning, offering the old Cowhand a
cigarette.

			JOE
	Smoke?

The old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette
Joe lit for him. Joe nods, still bemused.

INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe is cuddled in Sally Buck's arms, under the covers,
watching Woodsy, sitting cross-legged on the bed, naked
except for his Stetson and guitar, singing drunkenly.

			WOODSY
	... git along little dogies!

EXT. MIDWEST TOWN - MORNING

From a high angle -- the bus slows to a stop.

INT. BUS - MORNING

Joe awakens, stiff-necked, momentarily confused. He
straightens in his seat as he sees the old Cowhand lifting a
sweat-stained saddle down from the overhead rack, starting
toward the front of the bus. Joe calls after him.

			JOE
	Nice talking to you, old timer.

Joe stuffs a stick of gum in his mouth, turns to wave at the
Old Cowhand through the window as the bus pulls away.

			WOODSY'S VOICE
	She-dogs squat, boy. He-dogs stand
	up and lift their leg...

INT. REMEMBERED MEN'S ROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Woodsy, in his new Stetson, watches Little Joe in his beat-up
cowboy hat, trying to balance on one foot, one leg lifted in
front of the trough. Woodsy roars with laughter.

			WOODSY 
	... but he-men stand and shoot from
	the hip.

INT. BUS RESTROOM - DAY

Joe laughs, flushes, checks his hair in the mirror.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bus streaks past a brightly-colored billboard -- IN NEW
YORK, A WELCOME AWAITS YOU AT THE TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe is now sitting in the wide rear seat, between two young
MARINES and a group of VETERANS wearing campaign caps and
convention buttons, passing a bottle, singing "From the Balls
of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli..." Joe follows the
conversation between a VETERAN and a MARINE, participating
only because he's sitting beside them, adopting a remembered
military stance.

			VETERAN
	Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those
	Florida chicks...

			MARINE 
	Instant V-goddam-D.

			VETERAN 
	This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail
	bait -- but built? Ten bucks she
	wanted. Three of us made a deal
	for, twenty-five, see, big goddam
	bargain?

			MARINE 
	Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain,
	right?

			VETERAN 
	You got it.

			MARINE 
	No. You got it.

			JOE 
	Jesus goddam Christ, I ain't
	laughed so hard since I was out at
	Fort Benning, Georgia.

			MARINE
	Did you make the Viet?

			JOE 
	What? Oh, hell no. Motor pool
	mostly...
		  (shakes his head)
	Kee-rist...

INT. REMEMBERED WHOREHOUSE - ANOTEER TIME

A plump, aging PROSTITUTE laughs up into camera.

			PROSTITUTE 
	Hey, hey, what you try to do to me?
	You gonna cost me money, soldier!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe laughs as he passes the bottle, trying to sing along
without knowing the words as the Veterans segue into "Over
hill, over dale, we will hit the dusty trail, as the caissons
go rolling along..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck fondly wipes lipstick from Joe's lips.

			SALLY BUCK
	Keep your meat hooks off my
	operators, sugar, hear?

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe slaps one of the Veterans on the back, trying to follow
the song into "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder..."

INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME

ANASTASIA clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping.

			ANASTASIA 
	You're the only one, Joe, the only,
	only one ever!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe is leaning across the two Marines, staring out of the
window as the Veterans switch to "Anchors aweigh, my boys,
anchors aweigh..."

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY

A stunning view through the bus window past Joe's reflection.

			JOE'S REFLECTION 
	Gonna swing my lasso and rope that
	whole goddam island, yeah!

EXT. BROADWAY PARADE - DAY

Drum majorettes leading the parade -- ticker tape and
confetti -- girls at skyscraper windows.

INTERCUT NEWSREEL CLIP

Charles Lindberg (or James Stewart) waving at the crowd.

EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

Girls lining the piers -- flags, banners, bunting -- ship
horns, whistles, bells.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe crowded as the veterans prepare to leave the bus, lifting
down banners and flags.

EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEEL - DAY

The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns
honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square.

EXT. MARQUEE - DAY

Flag draped, reading: WELCOME VETERANS.

EXT. STREET - BANNER - DAY

Flapping in the wind -- WELCOME VETERANS!

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY

The marquee announces TRANSIENTS WELCOME. O.S. a singing
radio station break blares "W-I-N-S NEW YORK..."

EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY

The sign flashes WINS "... ten-ten on your dial!" A torchy
woman's voice sings from a lonely echo chamber -- introducing
a love theme which will haunt Joe throughout the film.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed,
then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his
Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television
set. Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter.

... the love song continues over a television talk Show
featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against
a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, "...well, I perform a real
service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really
live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their
feeling is real. They want to lavish as much love, give them
as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human
children or whatever..."

			SALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
	There's a TV dinner in the fridge,
	lover boy...

INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe stares sullenly at an antique TV box while Sally
Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror. There is a
framed picture of Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

			SALLY BUCK 
	You be okay, won't you? Maybe I
	bring you a treat if you're a good
	boy...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe watches the Panel Host, "... you're a nut case, fella, a
real nut case..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe massaging Sally Buck's neck -- continuing the
earlier scene.

			SALLY BUCK 
	I'm so beat, no point you waiting
	round, toots, think I'll stop in
	for a beer or two...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe sits on the edge of the bed, watching the poodles primp.

INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTEER TIME

Little Joe stares unblinking at the TV screen as Sally Buck
kisses him on the forehead, dressed for the street.

			SALLY BUCK 
	Expect me when you see me. Looks
	like I got me a new beau, lover
	boy, how's that for an old grammaw?
	I'll leave you movie money...

Sally Buck tucks a dollar bill under a framed picture of
Jesus, who has replaced Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

As a fairy godmother's magic wand removes sticky hair spray
from a pretty model's head, Joe's quarter runs out and the
screen goes blank. At the same moment, the love song is cut
off by a singing station break "W-I-N-S NEW YORK" Joe rises,
flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice
reading "...the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan
Vandercook. Up your income with sound investment
counseling..."

			JOE 
	Up yours, lady.

... but Joe leaves the lady on, savoring the expensive sound
of her voice reading the stock quotations. Joe seats himself
at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the
hotel. He picks up a ballpoint pen, counts ten floors up from
the street and marks a huge X -- THIS IS ME, then turns the
card over, pen poised over the address blank.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

Ralph stares at the card, surrounded by dirty dishes.

			RALPH
	Hell, he know I can't read...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe's pen wavers, starts to write and stops.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY

As we saw it last, deserted, a FOR RENT sign in the window.
Joe's reflection appears, staring at himself, dressed in his
dishwasher's clothes.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	After all them dishes are washed,
	what?

			JOE'S REFLECTION 
	Then they bring some more dishes
	and I wash them and then I, uh,
	sleep some and then wash some more
	dishes and then I...

			JOE'S VOICE
	Say it, lover boy!

			JOE'S REFLECTION 
	Die.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe stares at the postcard, bemused,

			JOE'S VOICE
	Well, you better just shake your
	tail, lover boy, and root, hog or
	die.

Joe rises abruptly, rips up the postcard and tosses it out
the window.

			JOE
	Goddam if I came to this town to
	write postcards.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

The torn fragments flutter down on the crowd -- a woman
brushing irritably at her hair -- a man grimacing, glancing
up -- a cop removing his hat to examine it.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY

From a low angle -- identical with the postcard photograph --
an unseen hand scrawls a huge X--- THIS IS ME. Camera zooms
up to a close-up of Joe at the window.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

From on high -- as though Joe were watching himself -- the
Stetson moves through a crowd of Fifth Avenue shoppers...

EXT. GLASS BUILDING - DAY

... passing a glass bank, lady tellers counting money...

EXT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY

... passing a display of imported luxury cars...

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

... passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing
as horns blast O.S. and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car
motions to Joe -- she needs a push. Joe grins, glances at
himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then
turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde. 

EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury
apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's
love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a
fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he
hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy
click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive
at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's
eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his
Stetson over his heart.

			JOE
	Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in
	town, just in from Houston, Texas,
	and looking for the Statue of
	Liberty.

The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows
her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she
stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile. 

			RICH LADY
	Were you looking? About the Statue
	of Liberty?

			JOE 
	Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean
	business!

			RICH LADY 
	I'm sorry. I thought you were --
	never mind -- I've never actually
	been there, but let me see, you
	take the Seventh Avenue subway, I
	think, to the end of the line...

			JOE 
	You sure are a pretty lady.

The Rich Lady tries to frown, taken aback, blushing.

			RICH LADY
	You're not looking for the Statue
	of Liberty at all.

			JOE 
	No, ma'am, I'm not.

			RICH LADY
	Why, that's perfectly dreadful.
	Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

A twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at
the corner of her eyes. Then she continues on quickly, just
as the light turns. Joe's view is blocked for a moment by
traffic, then he sees...

... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs
the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key. Still
from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and
follow the Rich Lady up the steps. The love theme swells O.S.
as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the
door...

... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island,
surrounded by towering wealth. The love theme continues
over...

EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

... a pair of high-heeled pink slippers, walking a miniature
poodle -- slowing slightly, reacting to Joe's cowboy boots as
they pass, pause and turn back.

			CASS'S VOICE 
	Hurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods
	for Mama.

Joe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches
CASS TREHUNE, a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the
look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food.

			JOE 
	Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand
	spanking new to this town, come 
	from Houston, Texas, and hoping to
	get a look at the Statue of
	Liberty...

			CASS 
	You're hoping to get a look at
	what?

			JOE 
	The Statue of Liberty.

			CASS 
	It's up in Central Park, taking a
	leak. If you hurry, you'll make the
	supper show. Now get lost.

But as she turns, Cass winks, dimpling the corners of her
mouth, signaling Joe to follow her.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cass holds the DOOR OPEN button till Joe enters the elevator,
then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh
and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl...

			CASS 
	Hi.

... her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at
their feet. Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden
dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a
pinball machine rings O.S.

INT. CASS'S APARTMENT - DAY

A princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk.
Cass runs to grab it...

			CASS 
	Hello?

... as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto
Cass's penthouse. Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger
into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while
she talks on the phone.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Morey? Hi-ee, honey...

Cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's
garrison belt.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	I'm just out of breath, honey,
	running to catch the phone.

As her fingers reach for Joe's zipper, cut to...

... Joe's hand unzipping her dress.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	I was walking Baby. Him got to do
	him goody-goods, right?

The poodle tugs at Joe's slacks until they fall. Cass steers
her ear to Joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Oh God, oh stop. I can't stand
	that. I just die...
		  (quickly into phone)
	It's Baby, Morey. Him trying to say
	hello. Say hello to Morey, Baby.

Cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting
herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing
the phone from one hand to the other.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when
	do you want me to meet you?
	Whatever you say. I'll take a nap,
	watch TV, you know, kill time.
	Okay, but just one, a big wet one.

Cass hangs up. The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling
himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch 
glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes
O.S.

INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY

The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to
establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin
coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass
explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily...

... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full
flesh of Cass's hip, activating...

... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full
volume...

... Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed...

			CASS 
	Ye gods...

... the images and sound of the television set flicking
joyfully from channel to channel...

... Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance...

... Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame...

... a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking
into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the
frame...

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY

... the Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY!

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Holy shee-it, this is a goddam
	penthouse you got here, Cass, a
	real goddam penthouse.

INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt,
glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower. He
flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring
the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a
pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing
animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz --
flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and
perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table.

			CASS'S VOICE
	Don't look, baby...

Joe turns to look as Cass comes from the bathroom, holding a
towel around her as she runs behind the closet door.

			JOE 
	Say, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed
	being here. Believe it's as fine a
	time as I've had in my life!

			CASS'S VOICE 
	Me, too, lover.

			JOE
	That's good, it is, cause, well I
	guess I didn't tell you why I came
	to New York, did I?

A tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door.

			CASS
	Zip this thing, will you, Tex?

Joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where
she sprays her hair with lacquer.

			JOB 
	Truth is, Cass, I'm, well, I'm in
	business.

			CASS 
	Oh, poor you. Morey's got terrible
	ulcers.

Cass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears
it with, orange lipstick.

			JOE 
	Don't know what line Morey's in,
	but myself now, fact is -- I'm a
	hustler.

			CASS 
		  (lips stretched)
	Hers'n zodda meg a livig.

			JOE 
	Beg pardon, ma'am?

			CASS 
	Said, a person's gotta make a
	living.

			JOE 
	You sure you heard what I said?

			CASS 
	Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half
	here. Maybe you oughta run on
	along. But why don't you take this
	phone number?

Joe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and
opens it. He frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Darn! I didn't get to the bank --
	Tex -- could you let me have a
	little coin for the taxi-waxi?

Joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand,
seductively.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	You're such a doll. I hate money,
	don't you? God, it's been fun.

			JOE 
	Funny thing, you mentioning money.
	I was just about to ask your for
	some...

Joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks
-- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joe's chin.

			CASS 
	You bastard! You son of a bitch!
	You think you're dealing with some
	old slut? Look at me! You think
	just cause you're a longhorn bull
	you can get away with this crap?
	Well, you're out of your mind. I am
	a gorgeous chick, thirty-one,
	that's right, you said it!

Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. Joe stands
bewildered by the vastness of her grief.

			JOE 
	Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I
	meant that? Christ, would I be
	asking you for money with a wad
	like that riding on my hip?

Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. He
hands her a kleenex. She clutches it to her face, wailing.
Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear:

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Hey. You are a gorgeous-looking
	piece, Cass. Guy gets horny, just
	looking at you. It's a fact. How
	much you need for that taxi? Ten?
	Twenty? There you go.

Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his
Stetson and starts out. Cass blows her nose, looking after
him. O.S. chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are
going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile..."

EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house,
chorus continuing O.S. "... they say you are taking the
sunshine that brightened our pathway a while."

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - DAY

Joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the
mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types
hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon, waiting for
night to fall.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	Excuse me, I'm just admiring that
	colossal shirt...

RATSO studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly,
child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an
empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front
of Joe.

			RATSO 
	That is one hell of a shirt. I bet
	you paid a pretty price for it, am
	I right?

			JOE 
	Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah,
	I'd say this was an all right
	shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know,
	have a lot of cheap stuff on my
	back.

Ratso spits as JACKIE leans on the bar next to Joe -- a
feminine young person, heavily made-up, hair teased, wearing
earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink  levis.

			JACKIE 
	Got a cigarette, cowboy?

			RATSO
		  (a stage whisper)
	More goddam faggots in this town.

Reaching for a cigarette, Joe glances at Jackie, startled as
Jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away.

			JOE
	Shee-it...
		  (shakes his head)
	Kee-rist, you really know the
	ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into
	you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas
	and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what
	do you say to that?

			RATSO 
	Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't
	mind if I do.

			JOE
		  (slaps bar)
	Same all around! For my friend,
	too!

The TV screen over the bar features a mating game program as
Jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked
eyebrows. The TV HOST points to three young men, visible only
from the shoulders up, from whom a pretty DATE GIRL in
blindfold must choose an escort.

			TV HOST 
	... and for the losers, who don't
	get the girl, we'll give as
	consolation prices -- a six month
	supply of underarm deodorant...

In a booth now -- the TV screen in the background, continuing
the game -- Joe is refilling Ratso's beer glass as he speaks,
loud over the laughter of the TV audience.

			JOE 
	... you see what I'm getting at
	here? She got a penthouse up there
	with color TV and more goddam
	diamonds than an archbishop and she
	busts out bawling when I ask for
	money!

			RATSO 
	For what?

			JOE 
	For money.

			RATSO 
	For money for what?

			JOE 
	I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you
	know that?

			RATSO 
	How would I know? You gotta tell a
	person these things 
		  (shakes his head)
	A hustler? Picking up trade on the
	street like that -- baby, believe
	me -- you need management.

			JOE 
	I think you just put your finger on
	it, I do.

			RATSO 
	My friend O'Daniel. That's who you
	need. Operates the biggest stable
	in town. In the whole goddam
	metropolitan area. A stud like you 
	- paying! -- not that I blame you --
	a dame starts crying, I cut my
	heart for her...

			JACKIE'S VOICE 
	I'd call that a very minor
	operation...

Ratso grabs the neck of a bottle, sliding back in the booth.
Joe scowls as Jackie appears with the tall farm boy.

			JACKIE 
	... in fact, you just sit comfy and
	I'll cut it out with my fingernail
	file. You won't even need Blue
	Cross, Ratso.

			RATSO 
	The name is Rizzo.

			JACKIE 
	That's what I said, Ratso.

			JOE 
		  (suddenly)
	Hey now, you heard him.

On the TV screen -- the Date Girl announces:

			TV DATE GIRL 
	I pick Number Two! He's cool!

			RATSO 
	That's okay, Joe. I'm used to these
	types that like to pick on
	cripples. Sewers're full of 'em.

			JACKIE
	May I ask one thing, cowboy? If you
	sit there and he sits way over
	there, how's he gonna get his hand
	into your pocket? But I'm sure he
	has that all figured out...
		  (to Ratso)
	Good night, sweets.

			TV HOST
	May present your chosen mate!

The TV host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the
lower half of the three young men. Number Two, her chosen
mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool. The girl's
spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically,
including the dwarf.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe has difficulty keening up with Ratso, who swings himself
along with surprising agility, his half skipping little gate
favoring one game leg.

			RATSO 
	Look, with these chicks that want
	to buy it, most of 'em are older,
	dignified, right? Social register
	types. They can't be trotting down
	to Times Square to pick out the
	merchandise. They need a middleman,
	right? That's O'Daniel.

Joe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red
light, yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts
his horn. Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi
fender with his fist, pretending to be hit, falling into
Joe's arms. The taxi stops, halting traffic. Ratso, recovers,
strolls casually in front of the cab, biting his thumb at the
driver.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	It is a crime, a stud like you
	passing out double sawbucks to a
	chick like that. With proper
	management you should be taking
	home fifty, a hundred bucks a day.
	More if you wanta moonlight...

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

At,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a
young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired
matron who puffs on a small cigar. Ratso waves jauntily at
the young man, raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle,
leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on.

			RATSO 
	Him I placed with O'Daniel just two
	weeks ago. And look. Not much of a
	stud either, what I hear...

EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - COCKTAIL HOUR

Ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone
booths they pass. Walking the park side of the street,
looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside
luxury hotels and apartment buildings.

			JOE
	Hey, listen, how about you take me
	to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird
	right now?

			RATSO 
	Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and
	I'd be doing you both a favor, but
	why? What'm I dragging my bum leg
	all over town for? It's no picnic
	and what for, for me myself, what?

Ratso stops opposite the Plaza hotel, pointing across at an
aristocratic blonde stepping out of a Rolls Royce.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Tomorrow when some piece like
	that's scratching your back in a
	Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll
	your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.

			JOE 
	Hold it, just hold it. You think
	I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name
	your cut, whatever you want, you
	got it right now. Five? Ten, how's
	that?

Joe peels a ten from his wallet and offers it to Ratso.

			RATSO 
	Joe, please. You know what I'd ask
	anyone else? Oh hell, tell you what
	I'll do, I'll take the ten...
		  (he does)
	... but when I hand you over to Mr.
	O'Daniel, I'll have to have another
	ten, Joe; just to like cover
	expenses...

INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso is on the phone. Joe holds the door open, listening.

			RATSO 
	This boy is just your meat, Mr.
	O'Daniel, believe it, I'm telling
	you -- what? -- Enrico Rizzo from
	the Bronx. The point is he needs
	you. Right now. Tonight...
		  (aside to Joe)
	I got his tongue hanging out...

EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK

Camera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel,
following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits.

			RATSO'S VOICE
	Name's Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in
	from Texas, don't know the ropes,
	new to the city, but very promising
	material, sir, and ready, if you
	get what I mean. Fabulous. Right
	away. What's that room number there
	again? 

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ELEVATOR - DUSK

As ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in
preceding shot. Joe grins excitedly at Ratso, who nods but
glances significantly at the elevator operator. Ratso follows
Joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop.  

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK 

Ratso steps out with Joe, gesturing to the corridor...

			RATSO
	Hold it a second...

... but the operator slams the door and starts on up. Ratso
leans heavily on the down button, glancing at Joe.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Nine-oh-one, got it?

Ratso glances up the elevator shaft nervously, rings again
and turns back to Joe. 

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Let's see how you look. Fine. You
	look fine. Now I'm gonna have to
	have that other ten...

			JOE
		  (digs in wallet)
	Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take
	that...

			RATSO
	Oh hell, forget it. 

			JOE
	Now take it. Go on. 
		  (gives it to him)
	Listen, where can I reach you?
	Cause I'm gonna make this right
	with you soon's I get me set up...

			RATSO
	Forget it.

			JOE
	I mean, dammit, where you live?

Ratso leans on the DOWN as the cage grinds slowly down into
view and stops. 

			RATSO
	Sherry-Netherlands Hotel. Now get
	your ass in there. He's waiting!

Ratso steps into the elevator as the door opens then closes,
leaving Joe alone, repeating "Cherry Neverlin" as he starts
along the corridor looking for 901. 

EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK 

Ratso bursts from the hotel, almost running as he disappears. 

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK

Joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor, knocks
confidently, hearing a few bars of his love theme as he
stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth. Then the door is
thrown open by O'DANIEL -- for an instant appearing to wear a
diamond-studded skull-cap, the naked overhead light bulb
bright after the dark corridor, halating in Joe's eyes like
the earlier dollar sign. 

			O'DANIEL
	You must be Joe Buck. Come in. 

O'Daniel, fat in a worn-out bathrobe, examines Joe like a
prodigal son as he leads him into the room -- as anonymous as
Joe's own room. 

			O'DANIEL (CONT'D)
	Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come
	on in and let's get a look at you.
	Turn around. Good strong back.
	You'll need it. So you want help --
	take a seat, relax, tell me about
	yourself. Cowboy, huh?

			JOE 
	No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but
	I'm a first class stud.

			O'DANIEL 
	Take it,easy, boy... 
		  (laughs)
	Seems to me you're different than a
	lotta boys that come to me. Most of
	'em seem troubled, confused, but
	I'd say you knew exactly what you
	want.

			JOE
	You bet I do, sir.

			O'DANIEL 
	But I'll bet you got one thing in
	common with them other boys. I'll
	bet you're lonesome.

			JOE 
	Well, not too, I mean, a little.

O'Daniel rises suddenly in a fury of self-righteousness,
pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically.

			O'DANIEL 
	I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a
	drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope
	fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief,
	a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop,
	I say, poop! I've heard it all and
	I'm sick of it, sick to death.

			JOE 
	Yessir, I can see that.

			O'DANIEL 
	Lonesomeness is something you take.
	You bear? Dammit, you take it and
	go about your business, that's all.

			JOE 
	Well, uh, I'm raring to go.

			O'DANIEL 
	Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy,
	huh?

			JOE 
	Uh, yessir.

			O'DANIEL 
	Ready for hard work, son?

			JOE
	Ready for anything.

			O'DANIEL 
	I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna
	be easier for you than most.

			JOE 
	Gonna be like money from home.

			O'DANIEL 
	Money from home, see, there's your
	strength, you put things in earthy
	terms any man can understand, son.
	I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm
	gonna run you ragged!

Joe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air.
O'Daniel laughs with him.

			O'DANIEL (CONT'D)
	You're a wonderful boy. You'n me
	gonna have fun, dammit, it don't
	have to be joyless. Say, why don't
	we get right down on our knees now?

			JOE
	Get down -- where?

			O'DANIEL 
	Right here, why not? I prayed in
	saloons, I prayed in the street, I
	prayed an the toilet. He don't care
	where, what He wants is that
	prayer.

O'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an
electric cord. He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off
the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic
Jesus glows on the dresser. O.S. a revivalist congregation
sings. And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns
and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner
evangelist.

			JOB 
	Shee-it...

			O'DANIEL 
	That's the ticket, just open your
	heart and let it flow. It ain't the
	words, it's the love beyond 'em!

EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned
preacher stands in the river, preparing to immerse little
Joe.

			O'DANIEL'S VOICE 
	Don't fight it, boy!

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

O'Daniel tries to pull Joe down beside him.

			O'DANIEL 
	Pray and you shall be heard!

EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME

Camera becomes little Joe, glimpsing the fevered faces of
Sally Buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank,
just before being plunged under the river. O'Daniel's voice
reechoes, filtered through water.

			O'DANIEL
	Don't be frightened, son!

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued
by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation.

			O'DANIEL
	Don't run from Jesus!

Joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a
newsstand. There is a picture of Joe being led away by two
deputies, under a headline ALABAMA MURDERER SHOTGUNS ELEVEN.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly
as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a
large convertible. Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but
stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the
front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand.

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull. The
BARTENDER doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe
approaches.

			JOE
	Say, you know that runty little
	bastard I was with?

			BARTENDER
	I don't know nothing.

Joe tenses as he sees the . tabloid picture of himself on the
back of the bartender's paper. Joe's hand closes around an
empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the
surface. O.S. women scream.

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Reflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing
bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women
screaming O.S. -- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which
shatters the mirror and his own image.

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The empty beer bottle stands where it was. Joe has
disappeared. On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out
by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph,
revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Colorful lights still flash seductive promise. The vertical,
lights on the MONY tower reach bottom and freeze momentarily.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe at his hotel window staring out blankly. Gun fire O.S....

INT. SHOOTING GALLERY - DAY

The radio at Joe's ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat,
shooting alone in the gallery.
Two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks. Joe
moves on, unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay
phone.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his
radio on the night stand. O.S. his love theme, remote,
hollow...

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe's radio is at his ear "... never too late to look great,
Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a.m., miles and
miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks
and nobody walks." For the first time, Joe is aware of the
other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways, the cruising
queens, the middle-age men in sport shirts. Joe moves on self
consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously
massaging his night stick. Camera holds on a window display
of gag buttons, featuring NEW YORK WILL BREAK YOUR HEART,
BABY.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe soaking in the tub, eyes closed.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE DANCE HALL - DAY

Joe's radio promises job opportunities for young men eighteen
to twenty-five in the U.S. Air Force. He stands with a crowd
staring up at a girl go-go dancing in the window of SERGEANT
PEPPER'S LONELY HEART CLUB.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe staring in the mirror. O.S. static over his love theme.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

By work-light, the tarrier in metal helmet leans on a jack
hammer, beyond the sign DIG WE MUST, drowning out Joe's
radio.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe flexing his muscles in his jockey shorts while -- LIVE ON
TV SCREEN -- a physical culture personality finishes push-ups
and starts pitching his own extra protein bread.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry
cook flips flapjacks in the window.
But Joe's eyes are on a sign DISHWASHER WANTED. Joe looks up
and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage
behind the counter. It's Joe.

			JOE 
	Shee-it.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street,
unable to concentrate on his comic book. On two-way radio, a
woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When I can't sleep,
well, I just dial the time and listen to those old seconds
clicking by like, you know, counting sheep?"

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

Joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady,
at the same corner where Ratso waved to another young man.
The woman's predatory eyes linger momentarily on Joe before
she leads the young man into the Cafe. The two-way radio
continues over, "... that's what I do about insomnia."

			JOE 
	Well, now, ma'am, next time you got
	that feeling coming on, you dial
	Joe Buck. I'll show you what to
	do...

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe straddles a chair, staring at a blank TV screen.

			SINGING COMMERCIAL 
	Need a little easy money? It's E-Z.
	Want a little easy cash? It's E-Z.

E-Z LOAN COMMERCIAL

As the jingle continues, we follow Joe and his radio into the
loan office, the depressing reality photographed and edited
in the style of a TV commercial:

			JINGLE 
	Easy locations to get to 
	Easy ladies to greet you 
	Easy chairs to seat you 
	Easy payments to meet 
	Let E-Z set you 
	On Easy Street 
	Joe arrives confident      
	Harassed E-Z receptionist     
	Lines of uneasy customers       
	Desperate, angry faces	
	Reams of E-Z forms to fill  
	Clerk's sneer, says		
	Joe has to be kidding

INT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT

Joe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph -
standing at the desk, waiting for his key.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Key to 1014...

Action continues as the DESK CLERK hands Joe a folded paper
instead of a key. Joe opens it, deeply perplexed.

			DESK CLERK 
	Looks like you been locked out of
	your room, buddy. Till you pick up
	your tab.

			JOE
	Uh, what about my things'n all?

			DESK CLERK 
	We keep them nice and safe till you
	get this straightened out.

INTERCUT

Room 1014 warm and inviting, Joe's suitcase on the bed.

			JOE 
	Listen, tell you what, you can keep
	all the rest of the goddam junk if
	you let me have just the suitcase.
	That suitcase means a lot to me.

INTERCUT

The postcard photograph marked X -- THIS IS ME.

			DESK CLERK
	We keep everything. House rules.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Joe stands outside the hotel, stunned, seeing the bright
colored lights turn suddenly grey. The film continues in
black and white as Joe walks into the crowd.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

The FOR RENT sign flapping in the wind.

INT. BAR - DAY

Joe nurses a short beer, like the regulars. He looks up as a
crippled panhandler approaches, vaguely reminiscent of Ratso.

			JOE 
	Screw off.

INT. ROOM 1014 - NIGHT

The bed turned back, clean sheets, a soft night light.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Joe is stretched on a bench, his Stetson over his eyes. A
loud speaker announces a bus "departing for Texas" but Joe
does not move. A policeman taps Joe's boots with his night
stick. Joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and
apprehension.

INT. PUBLIC MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Two matching Ivy Leaguers exchange a glance as they see Joe
washing his feet in the basin. Joe stares back with a
belligerent grin.

			JOE
	Any objection, gentlemen?

INT. ALL NIGHT CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Joe balances a cup of coffee, walking past the other solitary
night people, avoiding each other's eyes. Joe spots what he's
looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her
ten year old son, both freaked out, erratically touching
things, themselves, each other in a futile effort to make
contact with reality. But Joe is only concerned with the
plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls.

			JOB
	Y'ain't gonna eat them?

The woman stares at Joe blankly. The boy runs a toy mouse
across the table, up his mother's arm and around her face.
With a polite nod, Joe opens the crackers and squirts one
with ketchup. Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup
spills onto his pants...

			JOE
	Shee-it.

... glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only
one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick.
Joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water
dispenser, wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the
stain. But the water has only spread the stain across his
pants and down his leg. He blushes as a blonde young
streetwalker giggles.

			SALLY BUCK'S VOICE
	Wet your britches, lover boy?

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

Joe tries to hide the stain with his jacket as he checks the
coin boxes of vending machines, wary as he passes a burly
policeman, abstractedly snapping his handcuffs in front of a
bakery window display of bride-and-groom wedding cakes. Joe
barely glances at a confused MIDDLE-AGE LADY.

			MIDDLE-AGE LADY
	How do I get to Grand Central?

			JOE
	Shuttle. Follow the green light.

Automatically,checking the trough of a gum vending machine,
Joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror, the eyes
staring at him tired and hopeless. His hand reaches
unconsciously for a cigarette, The package is empty. He
crumples it in his fist but holds it.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Alright, cowboy. Enough of this
	shee-it. You know what you got to
	do? 
		(nods)
	Then go do it.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe hurls the crumpled package into a DON'T BE A LITTERBUG
basket as he emerges from the subway, his radio at his ear.
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street
noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a
policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for
the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising
but threatening, clashing, warning as...

... from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other
midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers. His figure
is momentarily obliterated by traffic then...

... zooming in, we see Joe self-consciously trying to hide
the stain on his pants, embarrassed as a large sedan slows
then moves on to stop in front of a motorcycle freak. Joe is
briefly obliterated again by a passing police car...

... the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in
close conversation with a frightened young FAT BOY, whose
eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe's black and white suitcase gleams on the bed.

			JOE'S VOICE
	Twenty-three bucks, I got to have
	twenty-three bucks...

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

From an apparently empty balcony -- an old science fiction
film grinds endlessly through the night -- a lost spaceman
trying to make contact with a tantalizing Martian maiden
across an invisible time barrier, theremin voices calling,
"Earthling, where are you?"

			FAT BOY'S VOICE 
	Okay. Sure. I got twenty-five...

At the top of the balcony, Joe leans back, turning his face
away as the Fat Boy embraces him, kissing Joe's cheek and
neck, his head moving down out of frame to show -- on the
screen -- the spaceman and Martian maiden meeting, arms
outstretched. But the Martian maiden moves right on through
the spaceman, crying, "Earthling come back, however many
centuries it is, I'll wait!" Joe closes his eyes, forcing his
memory back...

INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME

... repeating the remembered image of Anastasia and a younger
Joe, behind the movie screen...

			ANASTASIA 
	You're the only one, Joe, the only,
	only one ever!

... the remembered passion continuing, mounting -- intercut
with flash impressions, like flipping pages of a nudie
magazine -- naked, half-draped blondes gazing into camera
with sultry eyes, including one comic strip sexpot and the
calendar girl in Joe's Texas hotel room...

			ANASTASIA'S VOICE
	You're the best, the very best,
	yes, yes, kiss me, oh God please
	kiss me, Joe, now, now, now!

... Joe's face in extreme close-up, sounds of both movie
houses merging, confused, dominated by the voices of
adolescent boys...

			BOYS' VOICES 
	Hey, Joe, give someone else a
	chance! What's he doing for
	chrisake? He kissing Anastasia? You
	better swallow a whole goddam
	drugstore, man!

... an adolescent ratpack waiting in line behind the screen,
laughing in coarse whispers, watching Joe and Anastasia. O.S.
theremin voices call "Earthling, where are you?"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

On screen, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman,
crying, "Earthling, come back, however many centuries it is,
I'll wait!"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE RESTROOM - NIGHT

Joe watches the Fat Boy doubled over, retching.

			JOE
	I'm awful damn sorry you're sick,
	kid, but you gonna have to gimme
	that money like you said.

			FAT BOY 
	I was lying. I don't have it.
	What're you going to do to me?

			JOE 
		(controls fury)
	What you got in your pockets?

Eagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway
token, a dirty handkerchief. Joe grabs his wrist, revealing a
watch.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	How much's that worth?

			FAT BOY 
	I can't go home without my watch!
	My mother'd die! She'd die! Take my
	books! Not my watch! She'd die!

But Joe has already kicked open the door. Theremin voices
drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you?"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

Joe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail,
the radio at his ear. On screen, once again, the Martian
maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the
voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio. As she speaks, a
policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his
night stick.

			DESPERATE VOICE 
	Bill, can I call you Bill, Mister
	Bonner? I feel like I know you from
	listening. What I called about,
	Bill, I'm gonna kill myself...

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle, only Joe's Stetson and radio can be seen
above a passing bus, its side panel advertising BILL BONNER'S
STRAIGHT LINE, A STRAIGHT TALK SHOW.

			BONNER'S VOICE 
	Why call me, baby? If you want to
	do it; just do it, don't talk about
	it. Are we drunky? Feeling a little
	sorry for ourselves maybe?

Joe appears in full figure as the bus passes. He stands
looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window.

			DESPERATE VOICE 
	Well, Bill, what I got thinking, I
	didn't want the neighbors to have
	to find me, this young couple with
	the boy I want to have my cat, see,
	Bill?

INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

BONNER, tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone.

			BONNER 
	Okay, baby, now listen, just hold
	on while I leave the line for a
	minute. And think about all the
	kids that are dying overseas for
	you, okay, baby? Got that? I'll be
	back in exactly sixty seconds.
	After this message from...

A taxi born blasts, interrupting the sponsor's message.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake
injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street
toward...

EXT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of
lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe
outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their
conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic
-- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something
like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend...

INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.

			RATSO 
	Don't hit me, I'm a cripple.

Joe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder.

			JOE 
	Oh, I ain't gonna hit you, I'm
	gonna strangle you to death...

The cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip. He jerks
spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the
butt and drops it in his coffee cup.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	... only first I'm gonna turn you
	upside down and shake you out right
	here and now.

Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the
counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of
gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and
two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe
kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer.

			JOE 
	What's in your socks?

			RATSO 
	Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear
	on my mother's eyes.

Ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the
counter man. His socks don't even conceal his toes.
Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	You keep the sixty-four cents. I
	want you to have it.

			JOE 
	It's sticky. What you do, slobber
	on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.

Joe should leave -- Ratso obviously has nothing tangible to
offer -- but Joe hesitates, lighting a cigarette as Ratso
pulls on his loafers.

			RATSO 
	How do you like that O'Daniel,
	flipping out like that? I wanted to
	get in touch with you when I heard,
	but I been laid up with this
	cold...

Ratso touches his chest, forcing a cough which continues
itself beyond his intention.

			JOE 
	You want some free medical advice,
	shut your goddam mouth about that
	night.

			RATSO 
	Okay, right, right, okay. Another
	subject. Where you living? Still at
	the hotel?

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

The black and white suitcase lies open on the bed.

INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

Joe turns abruptly and walks away.

			JOE 
	Shee-it. I got better things to do
	than talk to you.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe strides north, pretending he doesn't hear...

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	Hey, wait up, for crissake!

... Ratso hop-skipping to overtake Joe at the traffic light.

			JOE 
	Listen, keep away from me, hear?
	You come near me again, I snatch
	you bald-headed!

			RATSO 
	I'm inviting you. I mean if you're
	not located, I got a place. I'm
	inviting you, goddamit.

			JOE 
	You inviting shee-it.

EXT. TENEMENT STREET - DAY

A contractor's sign announces LUXURY APARTMENTS AVAILABLE in
high-rise co-op, under construction beyond a raw of tenements
with X's taped on the windows. Ratso's voice continues over
the click-clack-click of Joe's boots and the flip-flap-squeak
of Ratso's loafers as camera moves toward a condemned
building.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	The X on the window means the
	landlord can't collect rent --
	which is a convenience, hey? -- on
	account of it's condemned.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Footsteps climb past rubbish piled outside empty flats.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	The electric's off. Another
	convenience.
	I don't mess with Con Edison, hey?
	What the hell, I got candles,
	right?

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as
Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely
furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a
burnt-out mattress.

			RATSO 
	I got no heat, but by that time,
	you know, cold weather, hey, I'll
	be in Florida. Stretch out. Make
	yourself comfortable. You hungry?
	I'll put up some water for coffee.

Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno
stove. Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to
test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him
suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to
restrain a large, comfortable yawn.

			JOE
	Comfortable, kee-rist, I slept on
	subways softer than this.

Joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily.
The sounds of the city recede. Joe's love theme plays softly
on a distant radio. Joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of
him elf.

INT. REMEMBERED CAR - ANOTHER TIME

A vintage dashboard, radio dial glowing, Anastasia's face.

			ANASTASIA
	Love me, Joe?

EXT. DEMOLITION SITE - DAY

A huge metal ball arcs on chain, demolishing a brick facade.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Ratso's face seems to radiate evil as he lights a Sterno can.
Joe forces his eyes half-open.

			JOE
	Smart thing for me to do is haul
	ass outta here.

			RATSO
	Whatsa matter now?

Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but
the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back.

			JOE 
	You don't seem like no fag...

			RATSO 
	What's that supposed to mean?

Joe's eyes close, his voice continuing out of half-sleep.

JOE 

Want me to stay here, y'after something. What y'after?

INT. REMEMBERED CAR - NIGHT

Joe's thumbnail flares a match, exposing Anastasia on the car
seat with Joe, both nearly naked. Anastasia butterfly-kisses
Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette.

ANASTASIA

Say you love me. Just say it.

JOE

Okay. I love you.

Anastasia purrs as her lips find Joe's breast, trying to
nurse. A flashlight flares suddenly through the car window.

NIGHTMARE - MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN

... Sally Buck shocked, hand still on switch...

... Ratso laughing as police beat Joe...

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe awakens in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets, wild-eyed
as he sees Ratso at the table, examining Joe's radio by
candle-light. Joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio
from Ratso's hands.

			RATSO
	For crissake!

Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet.

			JOE
	Where's my boots -- ?

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

Joe facing the crowd, naked except for his boots.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Ratso points to the boots on the floor by the mattress.

			JOB
	How'd they get off me?

			RATSO
	I took 'em off.

			JOE
	What for?

			RATSO
	So you could sleep! I mean Christ!

Joe inspects the boots, seats himself on a battered Army cot 
- which has been added while he slept -- swinging a boot by
its strap, considering whether to stay or go.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	I drug in a cot, if you want to
	stay.

			JOE 
	Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you
	something for your own good, only
	first gimme a cigarette.

Ratso offers a cigarette from his crushed package, Joe
strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up, staring at
Ratso.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	You want me to stay here tonight,
	is that the idea?

			RATSO 
	I ain't forcing you, like, I mean,
	who's forcing you?

			JOE 
	Oh. Guess I got the wrong
	impression.

Joe makes a slow move to pull on one boot.

			RATSO 
	I want you to stay, okay? I goddam
	invited you, didn't I?

			JOE 
	Well, I hope you know what you're
	in for. I'm a very dangerous
	person. Someone does me bad like
	you. If I caught up with you that
	night, there'd be one dead Ratso
	long about now. Hear?

			RATSO 
	I'm impressed. You're a killer.

			JOE 
	So if you want me to hang around
	for a few days, I thought you
	should know.

Joe yawns, picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the
cot. He puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Property of the YMCA. You make me
	wanna puke sometimes, Ratso.

Ratso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets.

			RATSO 
	Joe -- do me one favor -- this is
	my place, am I wrong? You know, in
	my own place my name ain't Ratso. I
	mean it so happens my name is
	Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

			JOE 
	Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.

			RATSO 
	Rico then, at least call me Rico in
	my own goddam place.

			JOE 
	Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?
		(then)
	And keep your meat hooks off my
	radio.

EXT. VEGETABLE MARKET - DAY

Ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several
sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk
vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies,
testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back --
till the GREENGROCER spots him.

			GREENGROCER 
	You! Out! Out! I told you, I calla
	cops!

The other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding
involvement. As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into
the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile.

			JOE 
	Hey, looka here, that ain't nice,
	picking on a cripple...

Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then
ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury. Camera
holds on a tray of coconuts.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the
fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of
rusty tools in an old cigar box.

			RATSO 
	The two basic items necessary to
	sustain life are sunshine and
	coconut milk. That's a known fact.
	If I can find the goddam hole the
	milk squirts out.

			JOE 
	This is an okay setup you got here,
	but I'd say you ain't just exactly,
	uh, flush, is that right or not?

			RATSO
	I been sick. Hold this, will ya?

Joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso
tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	In Florida, they come smooth, ready
	to eat.
	Down there, your only problem is,
	diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to
	wipe warm milk off your chin.
	Tough, hey?

			JOE 
	I think finding you's the smartest
	thing I ever did, for both of us.
	You just the crooked kinda sneaky
	little sidewinder I need to get me
	hustling in this town. Hey!

Joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick.
The coconut bounces on the floor. Ratso picks it up, holds
it, while Joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a
hammer.

			RATSO 
	Miami Beach is the only place for a
	real hustler. Florida has more rich
	chicks per square yard than any
	resort spot in the world. They lie
	out in their pagodas and pergolas
	waiting to grab the first jockstrap
	that passes.

			JOE 
	What's all this sweet talk about
	Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a
	stable down there now?

Joe swings violently. Ratso yelps, hopping on his one good
leg, sucking his thumb.

			RATSO 
	Cowboy killers! Break my finger,
	Christ! I got news for you, baby,
	no chick with any class buys that
	big dumb cowboy crap...

Ratso holds his thumb under the tub-sink faucet.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	... the cowboy bit's out, except
	among fags of a certain type, which
	take a certain, type hustler to
	exploit. Like I could handle it --
	being a stealing operation
	basically -- but take your average
	fag, very few of them want a
	cripple.

Joe holds the coconut like Yorick's skull, thinking hard.*

			JOE 
	Well, I am dumb, that's for sure. I
	don't talk right. I can't think too
	good. Just only one thing I ever
	been good for's loving. Women go
	crazy for me. Fact. Crazy Annie.
	Had to send her away. So I don't
	cash in on that, what am I? I'm
	shee-it. May's well flush me down
	that hole with the dishwater.

Joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands
while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	That's why you gonna stop crapping
	about Florida and get your skinny
	butt moving to earn twenty bucks
	worth of management you owe me...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

The suitcase lies open, displaying Joe's wardrobe.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Make that twenty-three bucks.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe slams his heel down. The coconut shoots out from under
him and he lands on his ass.

			RATSO 
	Look at yourself, Joe, no offense,
	but frankly, you're beginning to
	smell. For a stud in this town
	that's a handicap.

			JOE 
	You talk like a man with a tin
	twat.

Ratso sets the coconut on the window sill, balancing it as he
raises the X window.

			RATSO 
	You ain't got a chance in hell. You
	need threads and glitter, baby. A
	front, hey?

			JOE 
	Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage
	all that crap, or else he gonna get
	a coconut up his flue.

Joe slams, the window down. The coconut flies down to crash
O.S. on the sidewalk below.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

An alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY

Joe stands naked in the middle of traffic. A siren shrills.
Anastasia, catatonic in a hospital smock, moves toward Joe
like a sleepwalker, passing through him.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Wearing only his boots, Joe sits like an Indian chief,
wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso,
spotting Joe's jacket, slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid --
his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady. As she starts to
load a coin cleaning machine, Ratso intervenes solicitously,
speaking in Italian...

			RATSO 
	A woman in your condition shouldn't
	do that. Let me help...

... adroitly slipping Joe's cleaning in with her load as she
turns to seat herself beside Joe.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	It ain't right, stealing from a
	pregnant lady.

INT. HAT CLEANERS - DAY

Joe and Ratso stand waiting at the counter.

			RATSO 
	What did it cost her? The
	laundromat syndicate lost a couple
	coins. I'm crying.

The owner brings Joe's clean and blocked Stetson from the
rear of the shop. Joe sets it on his head and examines
himself in a mirror as the owner hands Ratso, the bill.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Where's mine? The black homburg? I
	brought it in the same time.

The owner glances at the slip, puzzled, returns to the rear
of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg. Ratso
quickly drags Joe away from the mirror and out of the shop.

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso 
- checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach
a shoeshine stand, locked for the night. They loiter till a
young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the
padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and
Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise,
flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz
drummer.

			JOE 
	Hey, you're good! I bet you could
	pick up a living at this if you
	tried.

			RATSO 
	And end up a hunchback like my old
	man? You think I'm crippled? You
	shoulda caught him the end of a
	day.

Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk. Joe laughs. Ratso turns
back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe. Ratso
is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging
his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his
night stick. Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken
padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all
three customers at the same time.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	You think it's funny?

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe is seated in a straight-back chair near the X window, a
towel tucked around his neck as Ratso trims his hair, almost
as expert a barber as shoeshine boy.

			RATSO 
	Stupid bastard coughed his lungs
	out breathing that resin all day.
	They buried him with gloves on.
	Even the fag undertaker couldn't
	get his nails clean.

As if by conditioned reflex, Ratso chokes on the cigarette in
his mouth, coughing painfully. He crushes it out, opens the
window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to
remove the towel from Joe's neck.

			JOE 
	Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever
	for a skimpy little gimp.

			RATSO 
	You like it? Take a look.

			JOE 
	Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I
	get myself primed, like I was
	turning on the charm for some
	pretty little blonde lady, then
	kinda mosey away slow and easy and 
	- swing around! -- and there you
	are, you handsome devil.

Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed,
faintly laughing at himself with Ratso. The wall mirror has
been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless
overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions, a tasselled table
cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new Florida tourist
posters, Ratso moves to Joe's side, arranging the
neckerchief, nodding.

			RATSO 
	Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're
	okay, you're okay.

			JOE 
	What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a
	cowboy outta you, kid. How about
	that? Build you up a little, teach
	you couple little tricks'n turn
	y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.

Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's
thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of
Ratso's mouth. Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one
instant, self-consciously, mimicking Joe -- then removes the
hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Okay, you got yourself one
	handsome, sweet-smelling cowboy,
	strut your stuff...

EXT. CONVERTED TOWN HOUSE - DAY

Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into
the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE --
endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering
discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any
language. A large-busted matron, on a French phone, fills out
a memo and hands it to an immaculate young ESCORT, who slips
the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office
and hails a cab. Ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly,
holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the
Escort's topcoat. The young man waves him away with out a
tip. Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab,
unfolding the memo as he joins Joe on the sidewalk.

			RATSO 
	How do you like that? Cheap
	bastard...
		(reads, then)
	I think we struck gold. This is one
	high-class chick. The Barbizon for
	Women!

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DUSK

The Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY.

INT. CORNER PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone.

			RATSO 
	Mr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss
	Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for
	Women. She won't need you
	tonight...

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

A doorman helps a young lady into a limousine.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	Would you believe a whole goddam
	hotel with nothing but lonely
	chicks?

Joe and Ratso watch from across the street.

			RATSO 
	Score once in that setup, the way
	chicks talk, Christ...

Joe cracks his gum, tilts his hat, starts across the street.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Get the money! Remember Cass
	Trehune? Cash! These rich bitches
	write a check at night, call the
	bank and stop payment in the
	morning. Get the cash!

In Ratso's eyes -- as Joe enters the hotel -- its facade
suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting
in every room.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe starts up the stairs, two at a time. A BELLHOP grabs him.

			BELLHOP 
	Hey! No men upstairs!

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Ratso warms his hands at a chestnut vendor's cart, seeing...

... zoom close-up, a lady in a window grabbing Joe.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe picks up a house phone, watched by the Bellhop.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Ratso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

The lobby watches Joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator.

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

Staring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's
imagination soars, seeing...

EXT. FLORIDA BEACH FRONT - FANTASY

... Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport
shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels...

... Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating
while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg...

... Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a
posh casino, flicking a coin...

... Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the
beach, at peace in the sun...

... the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe faces MISS BEECHAM, a reserved and rather plain young
lady in evening dress, She tries to speak softly.

			MISS BEECHAM 
	I'm afraid there's been a terrible
	mistake...

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

Ratso leans against the window, flipping a coin.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Miss Beecham is flushed with humiliation, the entire lobby
watching Joe in the hands of two bellboys.

			JOE 
	I want my money, goddamit, you owe
	me my money whether you get laid or
	not, lady, shee-it!

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out
Florida. Ratso glances toward the growl of a siren O.S.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

A police prowl car slows in front of the hotel. Ratso swings
across the street with incredible speed to meet Joe as he's
tossed onto the sidewalk. Ratso picks up the Stetson and
brushes it off, then helps Joe to his feet.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

From a high angle -- the two figures move slowly along the
deserted avenue, their rhythmic musical duet growing more and
more faint in the distance, a broken grasshopper and a six
foot tarnished cowboy -- passing a tuxedo rental store, next
to a lighted sign -- TEMPERATURE IN MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA 89
DEGREES -- their pace slowing to a dead stop...

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

... Joe and Ratso frozen -- rain on the X windowpane freezing
into sheet ice. O.S.
a radio commercial plays warm, sentimental music while a cozy
voice explains how easy it is to heat with Humble oil.

EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY

Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching
the huge metal ball demolish the building next door. O.S. a
radio announcer sells FROZEN SUNSHINE ORANGE JUICE.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe and Ratso frozen, staring significantly at Joe's radio.
O.S. a singing commercial, "Don't wheeze and sneeze the
winter away! Drink Frozen sunshine every day!" 

EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

Through the window -- Joe and Ratso watch the pawnbroker
examine Joe's radio, "Be healthier, wealthier, life can be
fine, when you drink Frozen" -- Sunshine is clicked off by
the pawnbroker.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe and Ratso frozen, wrapped in blankets as...

... the canned heat dies with a faint puff...

... water dripping in the tub-sink freezes into an icicle...

... the candle burns down and out, leaving the screen dark.

EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY

Joe and Ratso warm themselves on the smoke and steam rising
from a subway grating -- watching two officials in fur
collared coats inspect the front of their X flat building.
Reading their doom, Joe and Ratso, continue on, disappearing
into the subway.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe stands alone, watching the midnight cowboys ply their
trade. Camera pulls back as Joe turns away and enters a store
front blood bank, offering ten dollars to blood donors.

INSERT

A huge hypodermic fills the frame, sucking Joe's blood. O.S.
Ratso coughs uncontrollably.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Ratso leans over the tub-sink, dry-heaving while he coughs,
wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him. He controls
the cough with effort -- hearing the door open and close O.S.
-- wipes his mouth and turns to grin at...

... Joe, trying to light the empty Sterno can, deliberately
ignoring Ratso. Ratso shrugs, washes his mouth at the faucet,
finds a cigarette butt and lights it, careful to avoid
inhaling the first puff.

			JOE 
	Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out,
	then light a fag, a goddam fag. You
	make me puke. Where'd you steal it?
	In the movies?

			RATSO 
	The coat? A guy I did a favor once
	gave it to me. Christ.

			JOE 
	Who'd you ever do a favor for? You
	just let some poor bastard freeze
	to death, wouldn't you?

Joe slams ten dollars on the table. Ratso glances at Joe with
curious concern.

			RATSO 
	Where'd that come from?

			JOE 
	Forty-second Street. Where'n hell
	you think it come from?

			RATSO 
	You wanna know the truth? You dumb
	bastard, I got it for you. Look at
	it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too
	big for me.

Ratso pulls off the coat and throws it at Joe.

			JOE 
	Wear it yourself. I wouldn't put it
	on my back.

Joe throws it back at Ratso.

			RATSO 
	Goddamned if I'll wear it!

Ratso hurls it in a corner. Joe shoves the ten at Ratso.

			JOE 
	Go get your medicine. Before you
	die on my goddam, hands...

EXT. EAST RIVER BRIDGE - DAY

High angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind,
neither wearing the sheepskin coat. The Queens riverfront and
factories appear cold and bleak, deserted on Sunday.

EXT. LONG ISLAND CEMETERIES - DAY

Camera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent
housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated
by crumbling boundaries.

			JOE'S VOICE
	Shee-it. I hate boneyards.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	So split. He ain't your goddam,
	father.

EXT. PROTESTANT CEMETERY - DAY

Ratso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances
around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone
and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a
low dividing wail and swings himself over into...

EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY

... an endless section of plain stone markers. Joe touches
his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at
ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves
except for the name on the headstone. Ratso places the floral
piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity. Joe laughs.

			JOE 
	Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty
	little bastard, Ratso.

			RATSO 
	The name's Rico, at my own father's
	grave, a man deserves some respect.

			JOE
	Respect shee-it! You even steal
	flowers for his grave.

			RATSO
	Can he smell the difference, eh?

Joe reads from the ribbon on the floral display.

			JOE 
	Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't
	'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

			RATSO
	He can't read. Even dumber than
	you. Couldn't write his own name. X
	-- that's what it ought to say
	there on that goddam headstone. One
	big lousy X like our flat.
	Condemned. By order of City Hall.

Joe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily
depressed with an undefined sorrow.

			JOE 
	My Grammaw Sally Buck, she died
	without letting me know.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

Through the window, past the FOR RENT sign, the tarnishing
driers are lined up like tombstones.

EXT. JEWISH CEMETERY - DAY

Joe frowns, puzzled, as Ratso pulls out a black skullcap,
leading Joe toward a group of professional mourners,
whispering:

			RATSO 
	Just keep your hat on and cry a
	little. They tip you when it's
	over.

Joe and Ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the
grave, Ratso mouthing an authentic double-talk...

... Joe standing self-consciously, aware of the covert
glances of the other mourners, automatically reaching up to
remove his hat, remembering when Ratso elbows him in the
ribs...

... Joe scowling, tight-lipped, embarrassed by the tip that
is thrust in his hand.

INT. LUNCH COUNTER - EVENING

A weary Santa Claus, in a rented beard and over-large
costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup.
Joe and Ratso are arguing farther down the counter.

			JOE 
	Just ain't right, cheating someone
	dead and can't cheat back.

In the background, as Ratso speaks, HANSEL and GRETEL
MACALBERTSON enter the lunch counter, inspecting the
customers one by one. Both wear black turtlenecks and jeans,
dressed as twins, both blond and pretty.

			RATSO 
	You and my old man. Same kinda
	mind. Putting me down till the day
	he died...
		(mimics)
	... why can't you be like your
	brothers? Sons a father could be
	proud of. Yeah, sure. My brothers.
	Too goddam busy making something of
	themselves to show up when the old
	man's dying!

Conditioned reflex, Ratso starts to cough. Joe sees the
MacAlbertsons in the mirror, standing behind him, studying
him. Gretel nods, Hansel hands Joe a large black card,
smiling vaguely, then moves on.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	What was that all about?

Joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly
smiling, turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons, but
they are disappearing around the corner. Joe hands the card
to Ratso.

			JOE 
	You wanna read something, read
	this. I been invited somewhere.

Shocking pink letters on the black card read YOU ARE INVITED
TO HELP US BURY LOVE -- TONIGHT AT BROADWAY AND HARMONY LANE 
- HANSEL AND GRETEL MACALBERTSON.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	They picked me. The only one in the
	whole goddam place. You see how
	they looked me over, up and down
	before they give me that?

			RATSO 
	So?

Joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter. Joe
shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the
mirror.

			JOE 
	Well, this thought just struck me.
	It wasn't too long ago I was
	washing dishes way the hell
	somewhere in Texas.

			RATSO 
	Yeah, well, so?

			JOE 
	Now I'm here. I'm in New York City.
	Getting picked for things. Don't
	you see what I'm driving at?

			RATSO 
	What you're driving at, you want me
	to get lost so you can go to your
	fancy-ass party.

			JOE 
	Did I say that? Did I? 
		(studies card)
	It don't say nothing about you...

			RATSO 
	Don't say nothing about you either.

			JOE 
	But they picked me, right? So what
	I'll do, I'll just say, now look,
	you want me? Well, I don't go
	nowhere without my buddy here.

			RATSO
		(shrugs)
	Well, what the hell, I got nothing
	better to do.

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as Joe and Ratso
run, heads lowered, turning into...

INT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

... a drab entrance hall, dimly lit -- signs identifying
various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading
MACALBERTSON, TWO FLIGHTS UP. Joe has started up before he
notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the
stairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are
wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue.

In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in
Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak
or offer reassurance.

			JOE 
	Better dry your hair some. You
	sweating all over the goddam place.

Joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs
his head dry.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	You got a comb?

			RATSO 
	Don't need a comb.

			JOE 
	Few dozen cooties won't kill me,
	don't guess.

Joe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled
hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the
comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in
place, then looks back into Joe's eyes.

			RATSO
	Okay? I look okay?

In a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a
siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an
electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a
quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling
himself on the bannister.

INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT

A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter --
electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a
step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing
a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the
murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters,
LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the
amplified music.

			JOE 
	Better get a hold of someone and
	tell them I'm here.

Ratso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe
across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random
selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an
underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons
merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with
cameras strategically placed to record the happening...

... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera 
drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a
detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe
and Ratso as they approach.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Well, I made it. This here is Ratso
	Rizzo and I...

			RATSO 
	Rico. Rico Rizzo.

Gretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely.

			HANSEL 
	Do you need anything? I mean
	there's beer and so forth. Whatever
	your thing is...

The twins move away together, pausing to confer with the
operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower
girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a
sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed.
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE!

			RATSO
	If you want the word on that
	brother and sister act, I'll give
	you the word. That Hansel's a fag
	and Gretel's got the hots for
	herself. So who cares, right? Load
	up on the salami...

Ratso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him
but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a
light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies
projected against abstract currents of color and strobe
light...

... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at
a low table, rolling joints for the guests.
She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to
watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what
it is...

			JOE 
	Shee-it, this is one helluva party!

... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques
-- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air -
the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist
who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils
-- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at
the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action
around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a
veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming
her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's
head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face,
spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand,
grinning at...

... a serious young technician handling the light show,
scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh...

... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back
to the crowded loft, fascinated to see...

... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end
of the loft, photographing the scene below...

... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the
style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle,
predatory eyes searching the crowd...

... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the
buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware
of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he
steals, turning away casually, disinterested...

... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black
girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming...

... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant,
reappearing...

INT. MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT

... her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way
-- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be
embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror,
unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly
meeting Joe's eyes.

			SHIRLEY 
	I can tell, can't you?

			JOE 
	Yeah, oh yeah.

			SHIRLEY 
	What'll we do? Leave now or what?
	Your place or mine? Oh God, the
	second I looked at you I knew. Did
	you?

Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her
in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice.

			RATSO'S VOICE
	She's hooked...

INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT

Joe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering
hoarsely.

			RATSO
	... I'd say she was good for ten
	bucks, but I'll ask for twenty...

But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and
Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus.

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
	Did you know? We were going to make
	it?

Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley.

			RATSO 
	You really want to do business?

			SHIRLEY
	Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you
	two are a couple -- ?

The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped
in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs.

			HANSEL'S VOICE
	Why are you laughing, Joe?

Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at
Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body.

			HANSEL
	Are you for real, Joe?

			JOE 
	Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but
	I'm one hell of a stud!

Shirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear.

			RATSO 
	A very expensive stud. And I happen
	to be his manager.

The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly
confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and
out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the
center of attention in his own blown mind...

... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body,
lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...

			SHIRLEY 
	It's too much -- to come face to
	face with a walking talking sex
	fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God!

... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to
remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera...

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE
	I can't wait to tell my man Monday.
	I should be taking notes. Look at
	my arm!

... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh
on her tanned arm...

			RATSO'S VOICE
	I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower
girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing
one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction...

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE
	Eat it -- a man in your line of
	work has to keep his strength up...

... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate,
watching him bite into it...

			SHIRLEY 
	It's fantastic, now I know,
	everything you do has sexual
	implications.
	If I you know, bought it -- could I
	take pictures of you naked? That's
	part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda
	things?

... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to
promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically,
working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to
two girls dancing together...

			HANSEL'S VOICE
	We want you, Joe. You've been
	chosen.

... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors,
two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be
pallbearers. Joe joins them. All lights and cameras are
turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower
girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses".
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
	I had a thing for him. Before I
	knew. Why should knowing make it
	more of a thing?

... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral.

			SHIRLEY 
	Naturally I'll have to ask myself
	why a cowboy? And why a cowboy
	whore? But not tonight.

INT. MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT

Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister.

			SHIRLEY 
	Incidentally, how much is this
	going to cost me anyway?

Joe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats.

			JOE 
	Tell her, Ratso.

			RATSO 
	Twenty bucks...

			SHIRLEY 
	Sold. Let's go.

			RATSO 
	... and taxi fare for me.

			SHIRLEY 
	Get lost.

			RATSO 
	I agree. And for that service I
	charge one dollar taxi fare.

She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso,
takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs. Ratso lingers,
starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose
change.

INT. LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently.

			SHIRLEY 
	Your name's Joe. Which is fabulous.
	Joe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe,
	move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's
	just perfect.

They glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on
the bannister. He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall,
unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself. Shirley
and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the
stairs.

			SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
	He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is
	he all right?

			RATSO
		(rises, mimics)
	Is he all right!

			JOE 
	Well, if you're awright, why you
	hanging on the bannister. Can you
	walk or not?

			RATSO 
	Walk? Naturally I can walk.

			SHIRLEY 
	He's got taxi fare.

			JOE 
	Sure you're all right?

			RATSO 
		(shouts)
	I said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT

Joe and Shirley are kissing. Shirley rolls away, flushed,
fanning herself. Joe rolls down the window.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT

Joe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson,
bellowing at the snow.

			JOE
	Whoopee ti yi yo...!

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb,
whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab. The cab
slows to a stop. Then the driver sees Ratso, shifts into gear
and drives on. Ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for
a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his
way along the deserted street.

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile
hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly.

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE
	That happens. Don't worry about
	it...

Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically,
fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh. Still
avoiding Shirley's eyes, Joe finds a cigarette on the side
table, searches for matches.

			JOE 
	Well, that's something never
	happened to me before, you can bet
	your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the
	matches, ma'am?

			SHIRLEY 
	Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't
	call me ma'am, things would work
	out better.

Joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at
the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at Shirley.

			JOE
	First goddam, time it ever quit on
	me. Fact.

The repressed laugh finally breaks through. Shirley stifles
it quickly as Joe sits up, looking at her.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	You think I'm lying!

			SHIRLEY
		(controls herself)
	No. Of course not. Just something
	struck me funny...

Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely, reacting.

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
	I just put myself in your shoes. I
	had this image of a bugler without
	a horn, a policeman without a
	stick, etcetera, etcetera and I...
		(giggles)
	I think I'd better shut up, I'm
	making it worse.

Shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch Joe. But
that doesn't help either. He reacts sharply.

			SHIRLEY 
	Maybe we should take a little nap,
	see what happens?

			JOE 
	I ain't sleepy.

			SHIRLEY 
	I know. Scribbage!

Extreme close-up of Joe -- frowning, puzzled...

			JOE 
	Shee-it...

... camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game,
spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on
all sides, the object being to build as many words as
possible, Scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the
seconds. Shirley watches Joe's efforts to think with
sympathetic amusement. The only word Joe has composed so far
is MAN.

			SHIRLEY 
	That's pretty Freudian, Joe.

			JOE 
	What? It's a perfectly good word,
	ain't it. How much time I got?
		(glances up)
	Goddam sand thing drive you crazy.
	Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very
	strong point with me. Even in
	school.

			SHIRLEY 
	If you didn't talk so much, maybe
	you could think more.

			JOE 
	Talking helps. Don't talk, you get
	muddled in your head. Hey! Now you
	just look at this here!

Joe spells out MONY, down from the M in MAN.

			SHIRLEY 
	There's an E in MONEY. If that's
	your word.

			JOE 
	M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just
	exactly how they spell it up there
	on that big building, bet you could
	see it from here. M-O-N-Y.

			SHIRLEY 
		(stifles giggle)
	Okay. Never argue with a man.

			JOE
	Y -- what in hell starts with Y?

Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joe's
chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly
into his ear as she speaks.

			SHIRLEY
	It can end in Y day, pay, lay --
	hey, pay lay!

One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident -
disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his
thigh.

			JOE 
	Cut it out. That's cheating,
	teasing me so I can't think.
	Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna
	beat you!

			SHIRLEY 
	You gonna beat me, Joe?

			JOE 
	Beat your butt, you don't lemme
	think!

			SHIRLEY 
	Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that --
	gay fey -- is that your problem?

			JOE 
	I show you what problem --

But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking
his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal
noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat
wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved. Joe's love theme
swells triumphant. At the same time, Shirley half-rises,
trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top. The issue is
joined. Shirley has named the game. Her objective is to force
Joe onto his back. Joe's objective is to retain his
initiative. Camera ignores the classic action on the central
front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical
maneuvers...

... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders...

... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge...

... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth...

... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm...

... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly...

... Shirley laughing triumphantly...

... his hand closing on her wrist...

... her talon-nails clawing the air...

... her toes walking up his calf...

... her legs suddenly locking around his knees...

... her free hand grabbing his hair...

... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back...

... her lips pressing down on his...

... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh...

... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe...

... his hand catching her ankle...

... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams...

... her foot appearing upside down beside her face...

... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood...

... his head rearing back, roaring...

... both rolling to the floor, out of view...

... her feet suddenly flying up into view...

... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket...

... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back...

... her ankles locking spasmodically...

... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping...

... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as
her arm flings itself around Joe...

... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her
ascending shrieks.

			JOE'S VOICE
	Whoopee ti yi yo...

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine-to-five role as
a Madison Avenue career girl. Half-dressed for work, she is
talking on the telephone, her eyes on the open door to the
bathroom, through which Joe's voice continues singing.

			SHIRLEY
	Well, I really can't talk now, if
	you know what I mean, but believe
	me when I say, Myra, it's an
	experience every emancipated woman
	owes herself. I'm not. I'm not
	exaggerating. Well, what's Phil's
	poker night?
		(yells off)
	Joe -- are you available next
	Thursday, eight-thirty?

INT. SHIRLEY'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Thoroughly shaved, bathed and groomed, Joe is sprinkling an
expensive cologne into his boots. He yells back
enthusiastically.

			JOE 
	Well, lemme think now, Thursday,
	eight-thirty, yeah, I guess I could
	be available. Hell, yeah.

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirley turns back to the phone. Joe appears, grinning.

			SHIRLEY 
	Why don't you just come here? I'll
	be working every night this week.
	I'll leave a key with the super...

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Well, ma'am -- Shirley -- I sure
	hate to trouble you, but...

Shirley opens her purse, savoring the moment. As she places
the money in Joe's hand...

INT. MEN'S STORE - DAY

... Joe slaps a bill on the counter, admiring a fine new
cowboy shirt in the mirror, wriggling new white socks into
his boots. Suddenly remembering, he goes to the sock rack and
buys two pairs, one large and one small. Gradually
dominating, Joe's love theme recurs, continuing over...

INT. CHAIN DRUG STORE - DAY

... Joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of
medicine.

INT. CONDEMNED TENEMENT - DAY

Joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on...

INT. X FLAT - DAY

... Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the
stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets, his teeth
chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead. Joe stops
abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition.
They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns
away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove. Joe tosses one
of his paper bags onto Ratso's lap...

			JOE 
	See what you think of that crap.
	I'll pour your soup. Got some of
	that junk you like to swill, too.
	Mentholatum. Aspirin. All that shee
	it...

Ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering,
pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear. He sees
Joe watching him for a reaction. The best Ratso can do is a
slight shake of his head.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	They wrong?

			RATSO 
	No. But while you was buying the
	underwear, I could have lifted the
	socks.

			JOE 
	You couldn't lift fly specks from a
	sugar bowl. Can you hold this?

Joe hands Ratso the soup. Ratso seems steadied by the warmth
in his hands. He nods, sipping the soup.

			RATSO
	But thanks.
		(hesitates, then)
	Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this
	or anything. You promise?

			JOE 
	Yeah.

			RATSO 
	Well, I don't think I can walk.
		(embarrassed)
	I mean, I been falling down a lot
	and, uh...

			JOE 
	And what?

			RATSO
	I'm scared.

			JOE 
	What of?

			RATSO 
	What'll happen. I mean what they do
	to, you know, do with you -- if you
	can't -- ah, Christ!

			JOE 
	Who?

			RATSO 
	I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how
	should I know?

Ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop
over. Joe takes it and sets it on the table.

			JOE 
	Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see
	the doctor. I got nine bucks and
	twenty more Thursday and I gonna be
	riding high before you know it. So
	you gonna get you the best goddam
	doctor in this town and get
	yourself straightened out, that's
	what.

			RATSO 
	No doctors. No, sir. Not me.
	Doctors are like goddam auto
	mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug
	another. Operate for piles and
	while they're there, they unscrew
	your liver. My old man, for God's
	sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when
	he went to the doctor.

			JOE 
	Well, just exactly what the hell
	you think you're gonna do? Die on
	me?

			RATSO 
	I'm going to Florida, that's my
	only chance.

			JOE 
	You know what's wrong with you? You
	got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug.
	How you gonna get to Florida?

			RATSO 
	I'll find the money. If you just
	get me on the bus, that's all I
	ask.

			JOE 
	Just when everything's going my
	way, you gotta pull a stunt like
	this.

			RATSO 
	I don't even want you to go.
	Whaddya think of that? I got other
	plans for my life than dragging
	around some dumb cowboy that thinks
	he's God's gift to women. One
	twenty-buck trick and he's already
	the biggest stud in New York City.
	It's laughable.

Joe sets his Stetson on his head.

			JOE 
	When I put you on that bus down to
	Florida tonight, that'll be the
	happiest day of my life!

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl
away while he waits, hearing a phone ring. Then the phone is
answered by a woman's voice.

			JOE 
	Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah,
	well, when will Missus Gardner be
	home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a
	goddam good friend... Shee-it, I
	can't wait till then...

Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still
talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away.

INSERT

Headline -- WALTER P. BOX TAKES NEW YORK BY SURPRISE.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK

Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes
following a man in homburg and chesterfield.

EXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK

Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a
jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup.

INT. ARCADE - DUSK

Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal
cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me!" as
the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite
applause...

			TOWNY'S VOICE
	Bravo...

... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand
between both of his own, like an old friend.

			TOWNY 
	How are you?
		(more quietly)
	Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
	Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a
	paper manufacturers' convention
	and, frankly, to have a little fun,
	dammit...

Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away.

EXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK

Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder.

			TOWNY 
	This is my first night in town and
	I'll consider it a ghastly omen
	clouding my entire ten days, if you
	don't consent to have dinner with
	me. Anywhere you like...

Towny's mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate, but
his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a
sanitation truck, chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with
tinsel clinging to it. Towny is still talking when they've
passed the truck.

			TOWNY (CONT'D)
	... never mind how you're dressed.
	They know me. I'll say you're with
	the rodeo. There's always a rodeo
	in New York, dammit. Besides, you
	look very elegant...

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

Joe hardly notices O'Daniel on a far cornet, his whining
scarcely audible.
"Ye are the salt of the earth, Jesus said, but if the salt
hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted?"

			TOWNY 
	But, dammit all, I just remembered,
	we'll have to eat in my room
	because I have this phone call
	coming at nine-thirty...

INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

An ancient open cage lift.

			TOWNY 
	What I like about you, you're such
	a wonderful conversationalist. So
	won't that be nice to have dinner
	sent up?

INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A threadbare, carpeted but spacious hallway.

			TOWNY 
	Fifty years ago this was the only
	hotel in Manhattan. My mother
	always calls me at her bedtime, so
	I've got to be there.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The room has little to recommend it except its size and large
French window, through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual
tower flashes MONY. Towny waves Joe toward the couch, quickly
slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee
table onto a shelf beneath.

			TOWNY 
	A drink? I've got some nice gin. If
	you'd prefer something else,
	they'll send it up...

			JOE
	Gin's okay.

			TOWNY 
	It's so exciting. New York. The mad
	forward thrust of everything. My
	sense of time here is completely
	altered.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Joe carries Ratso down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese
food, soaked through with brown sauce. Joe finds the last egg
roll and eats it as Towny's voice drones on.

			TOWNY 
	Sometimes it seems to me time
	stopped twenty years ago. There was
	this war, there was this handsome
	young man with quite black hair and
	he was supposed to die. But he
	didn't. Isn't that amusing?

			JOE 
	What?

Towny's dialogue moves out of sync. Towny's eyes seem to look
into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it.
The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe
glances around the room, looking for something to steal,
losing personal contact with Towny, viewing him as an object
to be used for a specific purpose.

			TOWNY 
	Enough about me. I'm through
	talking for the evening. Now I want
	to hear about conditions in the
	West. The romance of the West holds
	a tremendous power over me. Mother
	was actually a pioneer woman, can
	you believe it? When she calls,
	I'll introduce you and she'll be so
	thrilled.

EXT. TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ratso sits an a stoop while Joe hails a cab.

INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Towny's voice is only a shrill monotone from here, Joe
searches with increasing desperation for something of value.
An old electric razor is too bulky for Joe's pocket, probably
worthless anyhow. Towny's array of medicines merely recalls
Joe's purpose.

			TOWNY'S VOICE 
	Mama, a coincidence. Guess who was
	being discussed. Discussed. Not
	disgusted. Discussed! Do you have
	that thing turned up? Why aren't
	you wearing it! This is impossible!

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe lifts Ratso from the taxi and carries him inside.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Listen, Towny, did I mention I got
	a sick kid?

INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Joe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror.

			JOE 
	Well, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it.
	And I've gotta get him South quick
	as I can...

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe stands in a long line, glancing impatiently at the clock
while Ratso waits on a bench, wrapped in his blanket.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Towny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely.

			TOWNY 
	I was so childish with her.

Joe moves into frame past camera, standing in front of him,
so that we can see the scene from behind Joe's waist.

			JOE 
	What d'you want?

			TOWNY 
	What?

			JOE 
	What you got me up here for?

			TOWNY 
	Oh, difficult, it's so difficult.
	You're a nice person, Joe -- I
	should never have asked you up -- a
	lovely person. Oh, how I loathe
	life. I loathe it. Please go.
	Please.

			JOE 
	You want me to leave?

			TOWNY 
	No, yes. No, I mean yes please go.
	Help me to be good. Come back
	tomorrow. Promise.

			JOE
	I'm going to Florida.

			TOWNY 
	This is terrible. I meet someone
	who -- then -- wait, I want to give
	you a present. For your trip.
	You'll let me please...

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe's face is expectant, next in line at the ticket window.
He nods reassuringly toward Ratso.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint
Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe. His eyes
are looking past Joe, his speech out of sync.

			TOWNY 
	Please take it. You don't have to
	be Catholic. Saint Christopher is
	the patron saint of all travelers.
	I want you to have it. For helping
	me be good.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

It's Joe's turn. The clerk looks at him expectantly.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe's voice is angry.

			JOE 
	Listen, I gotta have money.

			TOWNY 
	Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have
	thought. You shouldn't have to ask.
	That was thoughtless of me. Yes.
	Wait here...

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside
the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman
wearing a hearing-aid.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet
from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back
and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost
knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed
against the table, protecting but calling attention to his
wallet, Towny holds out the bill.

			TOWNY (CONT'D)
	Here. Don't even thank me.

			JOE
		(takes the bill)
	I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta
	have fifty-seven dollars.

			TOWNY
	I simply don't have it, Joe.

			JOE
	Get outta my way.

			TOWNY 
	You're wasting your time. There's
	nothing in there.

Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head
like a bad little boy. Joe backhands him angrily. Trying to
duck the blow, Towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but
grabs the table in his arms, watching Joe out of the corner
of his eyes, whimpering. Joe grabs his hair, turning his face
up.

			JOE 
	Let go. Let go of the table.

Joe slaps him, but Towny clings more fiercely to the table as
Joe tries to jerk it free. Joe strikes him with his fist.

			TOWNY 
	I deserved that, I know I did.

But he clutches the table wildly. His mother's picture falls
unnoticed. Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill
the role Towny has assigned him.

			TOWNY (CONT'D)
	I brought this on myself. I'm
	bleeding, my nose is bleeding,
	isn't it?

Towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood
trickling from his nose. Suddenly Joe jerks the lamp free of
its socket.

			JOE 
	You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars
	or you wanna busted skull?

Towny simply stares at the lamp.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Please let go of that table.

Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of
hitting Towny. Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls
limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed,
laughing and crying hysterically. Joe has to step over him to
reach the wallet in the drawer. He takes all the money --
probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the
room.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe carries Ratso up the steps onto the bus.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Towny's shrill little whisper says...

			TOWNY 
	Thank you, Joe.

... provoking Joe to glance back. Towny is reaching for the
telephone, his eyes on Joe with wild brightness, holding his
hand on the receiver. Joe knocks the phone from his hand,
hits Towny in the mouth, jerks the cord from the wall as
Towny falls -- gagging -- finally dislodging his dentures on
the carpet. Joe stands sick and confused, holding the useless
phone in two hands...

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

The bus driver revs the powerful engine, shifting gears.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

... Joe is about to hang the dead receiver on its hook when 
on sudden impulse -- he shoves the small end of the receiver
into the toothless mouth of the man on the floor.

EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - DAY

The bus roars into the tunnel.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso sit near the rear of the bus. Ratso's teeth
chatter, wrapped in the blanket.

			RATSO 
	Thirty-one hours.

They ride a few moments in silence.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	The trip is. Nine-thirty in the
	morning we get there. Not this
	morning but the next one at nine
	thirty.

Both nod for a moment in silence.

			JOE 
	These guys're good drivers.

			RATSO 
	They gotta be.

			JOE 
	Yeah.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bus tires sing as it speeds South.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have reversed places, putting Ratso by the
window. Joe watches a middle-aged couple try on their new
straw hats, unaware that Joe is watching them.

			RATSO 
	You get your first palm tree in
	South Carolina.

			JOE 
	How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like
	you know that?

			RATSO 
	I read it.

			JOE
	Shee-it. You believe all you read?

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

The metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

Two aging young ladies in brand-new resort wear are casually
examining Joe, along with the other men on the bus, but Joe
is frowning at Ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun.

			JOE 
	If you have to shiver, why don't
	you pull the blanket up more?

			RATSO 
	I been thinking. I hope we're not
	gonna have a lotta trouble about my
	name down there. Because like
	what's the whole point of this trip
	anyway?

			JOE 
	Keep the goddam blanket on.

			RATSO 
	I mean New York's one thing, but
	can you see this guy, imagine it,
	running around the goddam beach all
	suntan and he's going in swimming,
	like, and then somebody yells 'Hey,
	Ratso' -- how does that sound to
	you?

			JOE 
	Sounds like they knew you.

			RATSO 
	Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm
	not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the
	time, okay, do you blame me? That's
	agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all
	these new people my name's Rico?

Joe nods. Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

The bus passes a Florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAWN

Joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see
Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes.

			JOE
	Hey -- whatsa matter?

			RATSO
		(barely audible)
	I'm wet.

			JOE 
	You're what?

			RATSO 
	I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

			JOE 
	Hell, don't cry about it!

			RATSO 
	Here I am going to Florida and my
	leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest
	hurts, my face hurts, and like that
	ain't enough, I gotta pee all over
	myself.

Joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	I'm falling apart, that's funny?

			JOE
		(nods, laughing)
	You just -- just -- what happened,
	you just had a little rest stop
	wasn't on the schedule.

Ratso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest
thing they'd ever heard. Then Ratso's face pales as he starts
to choke and cough. Joe pats him on the back.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Hey, what size pants you wear?

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET - DAY

The bus is parked in the distance. Joe comes from a clothing
store, bare-headed, wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt. He
carries the boots, Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a
bundle under his arm. He dumps his cowboy regalia in the
trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the WAITRESS.

			JOE
	Couple crullers'n coffee to go.

The Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers.

			WAITRESS
	Where you from?

			JOE
	New York.

Joe pays. She smiles, gives him change. Joe smiles, starts on
toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished
something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human
contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday
happening.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider
than the others. Joe blocks the view of the other passengers
as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a
Florida shirt. In the middle of the operation, Ratso dozes
off. Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues,
lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist.
Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly.

			RATSO 
	Hey, what the hell you doing?

			JOE 
	I'm zipping your fly, what the hell
	you think I'm doing?

They both smile. It isn't funny enough to laugh at. Joe
arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes,
glances at Ratso and puts it away.

EXT. TRAVELING SHOT WITH BUS - DAY

Palm trees are streaking past the window. The sun is glaring
hot. A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the
bus as it passes.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep. Joe leans across
to pull down the shade. He hesitates a moment, watching...

... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to
work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now
dressed...

... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods
slightly, his voice practically inaudible.

			RATSO 
	Thanks, Joe.

			JOE 
	Shee-it, you know, I got this thing
	all figured out, Ratso. I mean
	Rico. When we get to Miami, what
	I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta
	do that, 'cause see, I ain't no
	kind of a hustler. I ain't even any
	goddam good as a bum. I'm a
	nothing, that's what I am. So
	reckon I'd better go to work and
	get me a goddam job. Okay?

Joe glances at Ratso, but there is no response.
Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face
away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand
as he smokes.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Yeah, guess that's what I'm gonna
	do.

They ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking
at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades
down. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing
that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward
position. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking
our view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning,
thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises
slowly, starting forward in the bus...

... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with
straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he
reaches...

... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the
Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.

			DRIVER
	Yes, sir?

			JOE,
	My friend's dead in the back seat.

			DRIVER
	Your friend's what in the back
	seat?

			JOE
	Dead. Dead as a doornail.

			DRIVER
	Is this some kind of...

He glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	Okay, folks, everything's fine.
	Nothing to worry about.

The passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to
the rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring
ahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches
Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	Is he kin to you?

Joe nods no.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	Don't you want to close his eyes?

			JOE
	Close them?

			DRIVER 
	Just reach over and close them.
	That's all.

Joe closes Ratso's eyes.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	I guess we'll just drive on, right?
	Nothing else to do.

			JOE 
	No, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see
	to burying then.

The Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.

			DRIVER
	Just a little sickness, folks,
	nothing serious. We'll be in
	Miami...
		(looks at watch)
	... in forty minutes.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. Then
he glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it
around Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.

A Susskind-type MODERATOR is speaking into camera:

	Tonight we'll discuss a subject
	most of us seem to consider either
	bad taste or frivolous or funny.
	But if our experts are right, we

An IRATE WOMAN speaks into camera:

Camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of

wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine. JOE BUCK grins
at the wall as he scrapes garbage.

INT. STALL SHOWER - DAY

Joe sings as he soaps himself, "Whoopee ti yi yo, git along
little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home!"
Sound and image freeze on Joe's open mouth.

SUPERIMPOSED MAIN TITLE AND CREDITS

TITLES follow as indicated, sound and action continuing after
each credit.

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

Joe's song continues over a sweating WAITRESS, glancing up.

			WAITRESS 
	Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Wrapped in a towel, singing in front of his dresser mirror,
Joe sprays himself with deodorant, aiming a last playful
blast at the unseen crotch -- freezing song and image as
CREDITS continue over...

... a calendar girl on the wall blushing orange, mouth frozen
in a tiny O, staring wide-eyed. Joe's song continues as...

his head, freezing song and image as CREDITS continue.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

RALPH, an aging black man, faces a mountain of dirty dishes.

	Where's that Joe Buck?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Singing as he buttons his new cowboy shirt, Joe interrupts
himself to answer Ralph...

			JOE
	Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

... continuing his song as he pulls up and zips his tight
thighed black slacks, freezing song and image for CREDITS.

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME

SALLY BUCK, a pretty middle-aged blonde, smiles down at

song and image for CREDITS.

	Where's that Joe Buck?

Joe hums as he piles a complete wardrobe of cowboy clothes,
still in their wrappers, into a shiny new suitcase of black
and white horsehide.

			JOE
	Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

Holding his watch, the Manager wags a finger at camera.

			MANAGER 
	You're due here at four o'clock.
	Look at those dishes, look!

Joe laughs as he locks his suitcase.

			JOE
	Know what you can do with those
	dishes? And if you ain't man enough
	to do it yourself, I'd be happy to
	oblige...

Joe picks up his suitcase, a portable transistor radio, walks
away from the mirror, then pauses to run a comb through his
hair, hook a cigarette at the corner of his mouth and strike
a match on his thumbnail before he turns back for one
admiring glance at himself in the mirror -- proud, exultant,
ready -- freezing the image as CREDITS END.

EXT. TEXAS TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

Joe leaves the hotel, carrying his suitcase.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

The pink Manager points at his watch angrily.

			MANAGER 
	Four to midnight, understand?

Angle widens to include Joe, holding his suitcase and radio.
Ralph stares at him curiously, stacking dishes.

			JOE
	Say, look, uh, I gotta have a word
	with you, if you got a second.

			MANAGER
	Later. Later maybe.

The Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes.

			RALPH 
	You ain't coming to work?

			JOE
	Don't guess. Just come for my day's

Joe tilts his Stetson as the Waitress appears at the door...

			WAITRESS 
	Cups!

... but she disappears without noticing Joe. Ralph offers his
hand. Joe takes it, holds it.

			RALPH 
	What you gonna do back there, East?

			JOE 
	Lotta rich women back there...

			RALPH
	Yeah?

			JOE 
	Men, they mostly faggots.

INT. SUNSHINE CAFETERIA - DAY

The door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY swings open and Joe appears,
measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow
employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room,
observing the drab details of the life he has left behind -
garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays,
coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on
formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping
suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke
glasses. O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this
valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the
sunshine..."

EXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

The song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria "... that
brightened our pathway a while."

			JOE 
	Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your
	chance.

From a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus
depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to
urbanize itself. The click-clack-click of his boots is loud
but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices
on the Commodity change. Joe's pace slows as he passes...

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

... a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the
sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted.
Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete
flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl
giggling sexily -- "Keep your meat hooks off my beauty
operators, sugar" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor 
- Sally Buck singing "Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird..."

... a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a
broken mirror, a FOR RENT sign in the window. Joe turns
toward the bus depot, radio pressed to his ear.

			ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	Benson and Hedges One Hundreds
	makes special awards from time to
	time for anything that's longer
	than anything...

			JOE 
	Care to get out your yardstick,
	gentlemen?

At the same moment, a recognizable variant of the "Big
Country" theme blares loud.

INTERCUT WESTERN FILM CLIP

Gary Cooper (or John Wayne) walks a frontier street.

EXT. BUS DEPOT - DAY

High angle of the departing bus, intercut "Big Country"
fashion, alternating high shots with close-ups of the bus
wheals.

EXT. FREEWAY CLOVERLEAF - DAY

Through the bus windshield -- a dizzying montage of traffic
lines, arrows and signs as the bus sweeps around and up onto
the freeway.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum
as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him
power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right
breakfast food, hair oil or automobile. Joe listens to the
humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.

			JOE
	This is a powerful mothah, ain't
	it?

Ignored by the driver, Joe rises and walks back to his empty
double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made
on his immediate fellow travelers -- an OLD LADY in front of
him -- a hostile young sailor with acne behind him -- two
teeny-boppers flirting with Joe hysterically -- a PALE BLONDE
directly across the aisle, smiling at Joe weakly.

			PALE BLONDE 
	Do you have a stick of gum?

Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick.
He watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth.

			PALE BLONDE (CONT'D)
	Thank you.

			JOE 
	Plenty more where that came from.

			PALE BLONDE 
	Thank you, no, it's just till the
	Dramamine works. I get carsick.

			JOE 
	I only get carsick on boats. 
		  (waits, then)
	But seems to me that's more the
	fish smell than the bouncing...

Joe realizes that her eyes are closed. Mildly depressed, he
stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio,
finds only static and snaps it off. Further depressed, he
examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black
head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of
tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the
flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out
match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary
cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks
apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the
roadside, watching the bus pass. Through this, leading into
the next scene, Sally Buck sings softly "... if that mocking
bird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck, relaxing in the middle of a busy day, eyes closed
wearily, while little Joe massages her neck. Her song
continues over the noises of the busy beauty parlor "... if
that golden ring turns brass, Grammaw gonna buy you a looking
glass..."

			SALLY BUCK
	No, a little lower, sugar, yeah,
	yeah, that's good. Grammaw's beat.

			SALESMAN'S VOICE 
	You gotta sell yourself, that's the
	whole trick...

INT. BUS - DAY

A seedy TRAVELING SALESMAN with badly-fitted dentures and a
frayed collar has taken the aisle seat next to Joe. As he
lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a
worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes
unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure.

			SALESMAN 
	It ain't the product and it ain't
	the price, no sir, and it ain't
	what you sell, it's personality,
	pure and simple. I ain't shined my
	own shoes or shaved my own face in
	forty years, how's that? Not bad
	for a kid that didn't pass the
	eighth grade, right?

			JOE 
	Yeah, hell, yeah.

			SALESMAN
	And that's my golden rule. Make 'em
	love you. Put yourself over and you
	can sell them anything. If they
	like you, they'll buy horsemeat for
	prime beef...

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

A gawky, adolescent Joe sits sprawled on the couch, leafing
through a magazine while Sally Buck bleaches the roots of a
young woman's hair.

			SALLY BUCK 
	You get him to the church, honey.
	He ain't gonna find out you ain't a
	real blonde till after you're
	married, then's too late.

Sally Buck turns, pretending to be stern as Toe laughs.

			SALLY BUCK (CONT'D)
	You getting too big for your
	britches, sugar.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign, painted on
the slant roof of a barn: JESUS SAVES.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Joe is alone again. The Salesman has disappeared. The bus is
dark, most-passengers trying to sleep. Only one reading light
still burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead
of Joe. Joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to
sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the
radio.

			SALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
	Don't forget to say your prayers,
	honey...

Joe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling
with the release button on her seat. She scowls as Joe leans
over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her
and turns away from him. Joe switches off her reading light.

			OLD LADY 
	I want it on.

Joe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles
back with his radio, aware of an OLD COWHAND seated opposite
him, replacing the Pale Blonde. The Old Cowhand is appraising
Joe's wardrobe curiously. He looks away when he sees Joe
watching him. Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to
open a conversation.

			EVANGELIST'S VOICE
	Oh, my friends, I say unto you,
	invest with Jesus, put your dollars
	to work where they'll pay off at
	compound interest. The Good Book
	says money answereth all things...

The Old Cowhand has rolled-himself a cigarette. Joe quickly
lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle.

			JOE 
	Light?

The Old Cowhand's "thanks" is lost in a fit of coughing as he
inhales his first drag. He settles back, wiping his watery
eyes on a faded bandana.

			EVANGELIST'S VOICE 
	... everyone who sends a dollar to
	the Evangelical Congregation of the
	Air will get free gratis a genuine
	leatherette hymn book so you can
	sing along with Sister Rosella and
	the Evangelical Choir...

			JOE
	You throw in Sister Rosella and you
	got a deal, right, old timer?

Joe glances across the aisle. The Old Cowhand manages a
faint, humorless smile.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Going far?

			OLD COWHAND 
	Up the line. Not far.

			JOE
	I'm bound for New York City.

The Old Cowhand reappraises Joe's wardrobe even more
curiously.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Ever happen to come across a cowman
	name of Woodsy Niles? Friend of my
	grammaw Sally Buck...

The Old Cowhand considers, shakes his head. Joe leans back,
laughing to himself.

INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to
the one worn by the old Cowhand. Sally Buck smiles on WOODSY
NILES -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair --
who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new
Stetson.

			SALLY BUCK 
	Like it, honey? Does it fit?

			WOODSY 
	You do me good, Sal, you do me real
	good. You know what I gonna give
	you for that Stetson?

Woodsy grabs Sally Buck, lifting her off her feet, carrying
her to the bed. Struggling, they fall across the covers
together, Little Joe laughing with them.

			SALLY BUCK 
	Woodsy Niles! The boy!

			WOODSY 
	He don't know what makes little
	apples by now, it's time he found
	out.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Joe shakes his head, grinning, offering the old Cowhand a
cigarette.

			JOE
	Smoke?

The old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette
Joe lit for him. Joe nods, still bemused.

INT. REMEMBERED BEDROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe is cuddled in Sally Buck's arms, under the covers,
watching Woodsy, sitting cross-legged on the bed, naked
except for his Stetson and guitar, singing drunkenly.

			WOODSY
	... git along little dogies!

EXT. MIDWEST TOWN - MORNING

From a high angle -- the bus slows to a stop.

INT. BUS - MORNING

Joe awakens, stiff-necked, momentarily confused. He
straightens in his seat as he sees the old Cowhand lifting a
sweat-stained saddle down from the overhead rack, starting
toward the front of the bus. Joe calls after him.

			JOE
	Nice talking to you, old timer.

Joe stuffs a stick of gum in his mouth, turns to wave at the
Old Cowhand through the window as the bus pulls away.

			WOODSY'S VOICE
	She-dogs squat, boy. He-dogs stand
	up and lift their leg...

INT. REMEMBERED MEN'S ROOM - ANOTHER TIME

Woodsy, in his new Stetson, watches Little Joe in his beat-up
cowboy hat, trying to balance on one foot, one leg lifted in
front of the trough. Woodsy roars with laughter.

			WOODSY 
	... but he-men stand and shoot from
	the hip.

INT. BUS RESTROOM - DAY

Joe laughs, flushes, checks his hair in the mirror.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bus streaks past a brightly-colored billboard -- IN NEW
YORK, A WELCOME AWAITS YOU AT THE TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe is now sitting in the wide rear seat, between two young
MARINES and a group of VETERANS wearing campaign caps and
convention buttons, passing a bottle, singing "From the Balls
of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli..." Joe follows the
conversation between a VETERAN and a MARINE, participating
only because he's sitting beside them, adopting a remembered
military stance.

			VETERAN
	Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those
	Florida chicks...

			MARINE 
	Instant V-goddam-D.

			VETERAN 
	This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail
	bait -- but built? Ten bucks she
	wanted. Three of us made a deal
	for, twenty-five, see, big goddam
	bargain?

			MARINE 
	Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain,
	right?

			VETERAN 
	You got it.

			MARINE 
	No. You got it.

			JOE 
	Jesus goddam Christ, I ain't
	laughed so hard since I was out at
	Fort Benning, Georgia.

			MARINE
	Did you make the Viet?

			JOE 
	What? Oh, hell no. Motor pool
	mostly...
		  (shakes his head)
	Kee-rist...

INT. REMEMBERED WHOREHOUSE - ANOTEER TIME

A plump, aging PROSTITUTE laughs up into camera.

			PROSTITUTE 
	Hey, hey, what you try to do to me?
	You gonna cost me money, soldier!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe laughs as he passes the bottle, trying to sing along
without knowing the words as the Veterans segue into "Over
hill, over dale, we will hit the dusty trail, as the caissons
go rolling along..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck fondly wipes lipstick from Joe's lips.

			SALLY BUCK
	Keep your meat hooks off my
	operators, sugar, hear?

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe slaps one of the Veterans on the back, trying to follow
the song into "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder..."

INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME

ANASTASIA clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping.

			ANASTASIA 
	You're the only one, Joe, the only,
	only one ever!

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe is leaning across the two Marines, staring out of the
window as the Veterans switch to "Anchors aweigh, my boys,
anchors aweigh..."

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY

A stunning view through the bus window past Joe's reflection.

			JOE'S REFLECTION 
	Gonna swing my lasso and rope that
	whole goddam island, yeah!

EXT. BROADWAY PARADE - DAY

Drum majorettes leading the parade -- ticker tape and
confetti -- girls at skyscraper windows.

INTERCUT NEWSREEL CLIP

Charles Lindberg (or James Stewart) waving at the crowd.

EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

Girls lining the piers -- flags, banners, bunting -- ship
horns, whistles, bells.

INT. BUS - DAY

Joe crowded as the veterans prepare to leave the bus, lifting
down banners and flags.

EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEEL - DAY

The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns
honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square.

EXT. MARQUEE - DAY

Flag draped, reading: WELCOME VETERANS.

EXT. STREET - BANNER - DAY

Flapping in the wind -- WELCOME VETERANS!

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY

The marquee announces TRANSIENTS WELCOME. O.S. a singing
radio station break blares "W-I-N-S NEW YORK..."

EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY

The sign flashes WINS "... ten-ten on your dial!" A torchy
woman's voice sings from a lonely echo chamber -- introducing
a love theme which will haunt Joe throughout the film.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed,
then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his
Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television
set. Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter.

... the love song continues over a television talk Show
featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against
a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, "...well, I perform a real
service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really
live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their
feeling is real. They want to lavish as much love, give them
as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human
children or whatever..."

			SALLY BUCK'S VOICE 
	There's a TV dinner in the fridge,
	lover boy...

INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe stares sullenly at an antique TV box while Sally
Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror. There is a
framed picture of Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

			SALLY BUCK 
	You be okay, won't you? Maybe I
	bring you a treat if you're a good
	boy...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe watches the Panel Host, "... you're a nut case, fella, a
real nut case..."

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Little Joe massaging Sally Buck's neck -- continuing the
earlier scene.

			SALLY BUCK 
	I'm so beat, no point you waiting
	round, toots, think I'll stop in
	for a beer or two...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe sits on the edge of the bed, watching the poodles primp.

INT. REMEMBERED PARLOR - ANOTEER TIME

Little Joe stares unblinking at the TV screen as Sally Buck
kisses him on the forehead, dressed for the street.

			SALLY BUCK 
	Expect me when you see me. Looks
	like I got me a new beau, lover
	boy, how's that for an old grammaw?
	I'll leave you movie money...

Sally Buck tucks a dollar bill under a framed picture of
Jesus, who has replaced Woodsy Niles on the mantle.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

As a fairy godmother's magic wand removes sticky hair spray
from a pretty model's head, Joe's quarter runs out and the
screen goes blank. At the same moment, the love song is cut
off by a singing station break "W-I-N-S NEW YORK" Joe rises,
flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice
reading "...the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan
Vandercook. Up your income with sound investment
counseling..."

			JOE 
	Up yours, lady.

... but Joe leaves the lady on, savoring the expensive sound
of her voice reading the stock quotations. Joe seats himself
at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the
hotel. He picks up a ballpoint pen, counts ten floors up from
the street and marks a huge X -- THIS IS ME, then turns the
card over, pen poised over the address blank.

INT. CAFETERIA SCULLERY - DAY

Ralph stares at the card, surrounded by dirty dishes.

			RALPH
	Hell, he know I can't read...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe's pen wavers, starts to write and stops.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY

As we saw it last, deserted, a FOR RENT sign in the window.
Joe's reflection appears, staring at himself, dressed in his
dishwasher's clothes.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	After all them dishes are washed,
	what?

			JOE'S REFLECTION 
	Then they bring some more dishes
	and I wash them and then I, uh,
	sleep some and then wash some more
	dishes and then I...

			JOE'S VOICE
	Say it, lover boy!

			JOE'S REFLECTION 
	Die.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe stares at the postcard, bemused,

			JOE'S VOICE
	Well, you better just shake your
	tail, lover boy, and root, hog or
	die.

Joe rises abruptly, rips up the postcard and tosses it out
the window.

			JOE
	Goddam if I came to this town to
	write postcards.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

The torn fragments flutter down on the crowd -- a woman
brushing irritably at her hair -- a man grimacing, glancing
up -- a cop removing his hat to examine it.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE HOTEL - DAY

From a low angle -- identical with the postcard photograph --
an unseen hand scrawls a huge X--- THIS IS ME. Camera zooms
up to a close-up of Joe at the window.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

From on high -- as though Joe were watching himself -- the
Stetson moves through a crowd of Fifth Avenue shoppers...

EXT. GLASS BUILDING - DAY

... passing a glass bank, lady tellers counting money...

EXT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY

... passing a display of imported luxury cars...

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

... passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing
as horns blast O.S. and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car
motions to Joe -- she needs a push. Joe grins, glances at
himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then
turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde. 

EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury
apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's
love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a
fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he
hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy
click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive
at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's
eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his
Stetson over his heart.

			JOE
	Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in
	town, just in from Houston, Texas,
	and looking for the Statue of
	Liberty.

The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows
her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she
stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile. 

			RICH LADY
	Were you looking? About the Statue
	of Liberty?

			JOE 
	Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean
	business!

			RICH LADY 
	I'm sorry. I thought you were --
	never mind -- I've never actually
	been there, but let me see, you
	take the Seventh Avenue subway, I
	think, to the end of the line...

			JOE 
	You sure are a pretty lady.

The Rich Lady tries to frown, taken aback, blushing.

			RICH LADY
	You're not looking for the Statue
	of Liberty at all.

			JOE 
	No, ma'am, I'm not.

			RICH LADY
	Why, that's perfectly dreadful.
	Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

A twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at
the corner of her eyes. Then she continues on quickly, just
as the light turns. Joe's view is blocked for a moment by
traffic, then he sees...

... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs
the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key. Still
from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and
follow the Rich Lady up the steps. The love theme swells O.S.
as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the
door...

... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island,
surrounded by towering wealth. The love theme continues
over...

EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

... a pair of high-heeled pink slippers, walking a miniature
poodle -- slowing slightly, reacting to Joe's cowboy boots as
they pass, pause and turn back.

			CASS'S VOICE 
	Hurry up, Baby. Do um goody-goods
	for Mama.

Joe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches
CASS TREHUNE, a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the
look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food.

			JOE 
	Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand
	spanking new to this town, come 
	from Houston, Texas, and hoping to
	get a look at the Statue of
	Liberty...

			CASS 
	You're hoping to get a look at
	what?

			JOE 
	The Statue of Liberty.

			CASS 
	It's up in Central Park, taking a
	leak. If you hurry, you'll make the
	supper show. Now get lost.

But as she turns, Cass winks, dimpling the corners of her
mouth, signaling Joe to follow her.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cass holds the DOOR OPEN button till Joe enters the elevator,
then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh
and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl...

			CASS 
	Hi.

... her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at
their feet. Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden
dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a
pinball machine rings O.S.

INT. CASS'S APARTMENT - DAY

A princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk.
Cass runs to grab it...

			CASS 
	Hello?

... as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto
Cass's penthouse. Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger
into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while
she talks on the phone.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Morey? Hi-ee, honey...

Cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's
garrison belt.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	I'm just out of breath, honey,
	running to catch the phone.

As her fingers reach for Joe's zipper, cut to...

... Joe's hand unzipping her dress.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	I was walking Baby. Him got to do
	him goody-goods, right?

The poodle tugs at Joe's slacks until they fall. Cass steers
her ear to Joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Oh God, oh stop. I can't stand
	that. I just die...
		  (quickly into phone)
	It's Baby, Morey. Him trying to say
	hello. Say hello to Morey, Baby.

Cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting
herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing
the phone from one hand to the other.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when
	do you want me to meet you?
	Whatever you say. I'll take a nap,
	watch TV, you know, kill time.
	Okay, but just one, a big wet one.

Cass hangs up. The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling
himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch 
glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes
O.S.

INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY

The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to
establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin
coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass
explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily...

... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full
flesh of Cass's hip, activating...

... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full
volume...

... Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed...

			CASS 
	Ye gods...

... the images and sound of the television set flicking
joyfully from channel to channel...

... Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance...

... Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame...

... a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking
into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the
frame...

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY

... the Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY!

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Holy shee-it, this is a goddam
	penthouse you got here, Cass, a
	real goddam penthouse.

INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY

Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt,
glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower. He
flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring
the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a
pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing
animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz --
flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and
perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table.

			CASS'S VOICE
	Don't look, baby...

Joe turns to look as Cass comes from the bathroom, holding a
towel around her as she runs behind the closet door.

			JOE 
	Say, Cass, I, uh, sure have enjoyed
	being here. Believe it's as fine a
	time as I've had in my life!

			CASS'S VOICE 
	Me, too, lover.

			JOE
	That's good, it is, cause, well I
	guess I didn't tell you why I came
	to New York, did I?

A tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door.

			CASS
	Zip this thing, will you, Tex?

Joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where
she sprays her hair with lacquer.

			JOB 
	Truth is, Cass, I'm, well, I'm in
	business.

			CASS 
	Oh, poor you. Morey's got terrible
	ulcers.

Cass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears
it with, orange lipstick.

			JOE 
	Don't know what line Morey's in,
	but myself now, fact is -- I'm a
	hustler.

			CASS 
		  (lips stretched)
	Hers'n zodda meg a livig.

			JOE 
	Beg pardon, ma'am?

			CASS 
	Said, a person's gotta make a
	living.

			JOE 
	You sure you heard what I said?

			CASS 
	Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half
	here. Maybe you oughta run on
	along. But why don't you take this
	phone number?

Joe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and
opens it. He frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	Darn! I didn't get to the bank --
	Tex -- could you let me have a
	little coin for the taxi-waxi?

Joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand,
seductively.

			CASS (CONT'D)
	You're such a doll. I hate money,
	don't you? God, it's been fun.

			JOE 
	Funny thing, you mentioning money.
	I was just about to ask your for
	some...

Joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks
-- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joe's chin.

			CASS 
	You bastard! You son of a bitch!
	You think you're dealing with some
	old slut? Look at me! You think
	just cause you're a longhorn bull
	you can get away with this crap?
	Well, you're out of your mind. I am
	a gorgeous chick, thirty-one,
	that's right, you said it!

Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. Joe stands
bewildered by the vastness of her grief.

			JOE 
	Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I
	meant that? Christ, would I be
	asking you for money with a wad
	like that riding on my hip?

Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. He
hands her a kleenex. She clutches it to her face, wailing.
Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear:

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Hey. You are a gorgeous-looking
	piece, Cass. Guy gets horny, just
	looking at you. It's a fact. How
	much you need for that taxi? Ten?
	Twenty? There you go.

Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his
Stetson and starts out. Cass blows her nose, looking after
him. O.S. chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are
going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile..."

EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house,
chorus continuing O.S. "... they say you are taking the
sunshine that brightened our pathway a while."

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - DAY

Joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the
mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types
hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon, waiting for
night to fall.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	Excuse me, I'm just admiring that
	colossal shirt...

RATSO studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly,
child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an
empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front
of Joe.

			RATSO 
	That is one hell of a shirt. I bet
	you paid a pretty price for it, am
	I right?

			JOE 
	Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah,
	I'd say this was an all right
	shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know,
	have a lot of cheap stuff on my
	back.

Ratso spits as JACKIE leans on the bar next to Joe -- a
feminine young person, heavily made-up, hair teased, wearing
earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink  levis.

			JACKIE 
	Got a cigarette, cowboy?

			RATSO
		  (a stage whisper)
	More goddam faggots in this town.

Reaching for a cigarette, Joe glances at Jackie, startled as
Jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away.

			JOE
	Shee-it...
		  (shakes his head)
	Kee-rist, you really know the
	ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into
	you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas
	and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what
	do you say to that?

			RATSO 
	Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't
	mind if I do.

			JOE
		  (slaps bar)
	Same all around! For my friend,
	too!

The TV screen over the bar features a mating game program as
Jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked
eyebrows. The TV HOST points to three young men, visible only
from the shoulders up, from whom a pretty DATE GIRL in
blindfold must choose an escort.

			TV HOST 
	... and for the losers, who don't
	get the girl, we'll give as
	consolation prices -- a six month
	supply of underarm deodorant...

In a booth now -- the TV screen in the background, continuing
the game -- Joe is refilling Ratso's beer glass as he speaks,
loud over the laughter of the TV audience.

			JOE 
	... you see what I'm getting at
	here? She got a penthouse up there
	with color TV and more goddam
	diamonds than an archbishop and she
	busts out bawling when I ask for
	money!

			RATSO 
	For what?

			JOE 
	For money.

			RATSO 
	For money for what?

			JOE 
	I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you
	know that?

			RATSO 
	How would I know? You gotta tell a
	person these things 
		  (shakes his head)
	A hustler? Picking up trade on the
	street like that -- baby, believe
	me -- you need management.

			JOE 
	I think you just put your finger on
	it, I do.

			RATSO 
	My friend O'Daniel. That's who you
	need. Operates the biggest stable
	in town. In the whole goddam
	metropolitan area. A stud like you 
	- paying! -- not that I blame you --
	a dame starts crying, I cut my
	heart for her...

			JACKIE'S VOICE 
	I'd call that a very minor
	operation...

Ratso grabs the neck of a bottle, sliding back in the booth.
Joe scowls as Jackie appears with the tall farm boy.

			JACKIE 
	... in fact, you just sit comfy and
	I'll cut it out with my fingernail
	file. You won't even need Blue
	Cross, Ratso.

			RATSO 
	The name is Rizzo.

			JACKIE 
	That's what I said, Ratso.

			JOE 
		  (suddenly)
	Hey now, you heard him.

On the TV screen -- the Date Girl announces:

			TV DATE GIRL 
	I pick Number Two! He's cool!

			RATSO 
	That's okay, Joe. I'm used to these
	types that like to pick on
	cripples. Sewers're full of 'em.

			JACKIE
	May I ask one thing, cowboy? If you
	sit there and he sits way over
	there, how's he gonna get his hand
	into your pocket? But I'm sure he
	has that all figured out...
		  (to Ratso)
	Good night, sweets.

			TV HOST
	May present your chosen mate!

The TV host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the
lower half of the three young men. Number Two, her chosen
mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool. The girl's
spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically,
including the dwarf.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe has difficulty keening up with Ratso, who swings himself
along with surprising agility, his half skipping little gate
favoring one game leg.

			RATSO 
	Look, with these chicks that want
	to buy it, most of 'em are older,
	dignified, right? Social register
	types. They can't be trotting down
	to Times Square to pick out the
	merchandise. They need a middleman,
	right? That's O'Daniel.

Joe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red
light, yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts
his horn. Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi
fender with his fist, pretending to be hit, falling into
Joe's arms. The taxi stops, halting traffic. Ratso, recovers,
strolls casually in front of the cab, biting his thumb at the
driver.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	It is a crime, a stud like you
	passing out double sawbucks to a
	chick like that. With proper
	management you should be taking
	home fifty, a hundred bucks a day.
	More if you wanta moonlight...

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

At,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a
young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired
matron who puffs on a small cigar. Ratso waves jauntily at
the young man, raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle,
leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on.

			RATSO 
	Him I placed with O'Daniel just two
	weeks ago. And look. Not much of a
	stud either, what I hear...

EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - COCKTAIL HOUR

Ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone
booths they pass. Walking the park side of the street,
looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside
luxury hotels and apartment buildings.

			JOE
	Hey, listen, how about you take me
	to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird
	right now?

			RATSO 
	Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and
	I'd be doing you both a favor, but
	why? What'm I dragging my bum leg
	all over town for? It's no picnic
	and what for, for me myself, what?

Ratso stops opposite the Plaza hotel, pointing across at an
aristocratic blonde stepping out of a Rolls Royce.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Tomorrow when some piece like
	that's scratching your back in a
	Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll
	your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.

			JOE 
	Hold it, just hold it. You think
	I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name
	your cut, whatever you want, you
	got it right now. Five? Ten, how's
	that?

Joe peels a ten from his wallet and offers it to Ratso.

			RATSO 
	Joe, please. You know what I'd ask
	anyone else? Oh hell, tell you what
	I'll do, I'll take the ten...
		  (he does)
	... but when I hand you over to Mr.
	O'Daniel, I'll have to have another
	ten, Joe; just to like cover
	expenses...

INT. PUBLIC PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso is on the phone. Joe holds the door open, listening.

			RATSO 
	This boy is just your meat, Mr.
	O'Daniel, believe it, I'm telling
	you -- what? -- Enrico Rizzo from
	the Bronx. The point is he needs
	you. Right now. Tonight...
		  (aside to Joe)
	I got his tongue hanging out...

EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK

Camera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel,
following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits.

			RATSO'S VOICE
	Name's Joe Buck. Cowboy. Just in
	from Texas, don't know the ropes,
	new to the city, but very promising
	material, sir, and ready, if you
	get what I mean. Fabulous. Right
	away. What's that room number there
	again? 

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ELEVATOR - DUSK

As ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in
preceding shot. Joe grins excitedly at Ratso, who nods but
glances significantly at the elevator operator. Ratso follows
Joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop.  

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK 

Ratso steps out with Joe, gesturing to the corridor...

			RATSO
	Hold it a second...

... but the operator slams the door and starts on up. Ratso
leans heavily on the down button, glancing at Joe.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Nine-oh-one, got it?

Ratso glances up the elevator shaft nervously, rings again
and turns back to Joe. 

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Let's see how you look. Fine. You
	look fine. Now I'm gonna have to
	have that other ten...

			JOE
		  (digs in wallet)
	Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take
	that...

			RATSO
	Oh hell, forget it. 

			JOE
	Now take it. Go on. 
		  (gives it to him)
	Listen, where can I reach you?
	Cause I'm gonna make this right
	with you soon's I get me set up...

			RATSO
	Forget it.

			JOE
	I mean, dammit, where you live?

Ratso leans on the DOWN as the cage grinds slowly down into
view and stops. 

			RATSO
	Sherry-Netherlands Hotel. Now get
	your ass in there. He's waiting!

Ratso steps into the elevator as the door opens then closes,
leaving Joe alone, repeating "Cherry Neverlin" as he starts
along the corridor looking for 901. 

EXT. WEST SIDE HOTEL - DUSK 

Ratso bursts from the hotel, almost running as he disappears. 

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL CORRIDOR - DUSK

Joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor, knocks
confidently, hearing a few bars of his love theme as he
stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth. Then the door is
thrown open by O'DANIEL -- for an instant appearing to wear a
diamond-studded skull-cap, the naked overhead light bulb
bright after the dark corridor, halating in Joe's eyes like
the earlier dollar sign. 

			O'DANIEL
	You must be Joe Buck. Come in. 

O'Daniel, fat in a worn-out bathrobe, examines Joe like a
prodigal son as he leads him into the room -- as anonymous as
Joe's own room. 

			O'DANIEL (CONT'D)
	Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come
	on in and let's get a look at you.
	Turn around. Good strong back.
	You'll need it. So you want help --
	take a seat, relax, tell me about
	yourself. Cowboy, huh?

			JOE 
	No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but
	I'm a first class stud.

			O'DANIEL 
	Take it,easy, boy... 
		  (laughs)
	Seems to me you're different than a
	lotta boys that come to me. Most of
	'em seem troubled, confused, but
	I'd say you knew exactly what you
	want.

			JOE
	You bet I do, sir.

			O'DANIEL 
	But I'll bet you got one thing in
	common with them other boys. I'll
	bet you're lonesome.

			JOE 
	Well, not too, I mean, a little.

O'Daniel rises suddenly in a fury of self-righteousness,
pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically.

			O'DANIEL 
	I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a
	drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope
	fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief,
	a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop,
	I say, poop! I've heard it all and
	I'm sick of it, sick to death.

			JOE 
	Yessir, I can see that.

			O'DANIEL 
	Lonesomeness is something you take.
	You bear? Dammit, you take it and
	go about your business, that's all.

			JOE 
	Well, uh, I'm raring to go.

			O'DANIEL 
	Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy,
	huh?

			JOE 
	Uh, yessir.

			O'DANIEL 
	Ready for hard work, son?

			JOE
	Ready for anything.

			O'DANIEL 
	I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna
	be easier for you than most.

			JOE 
	Gonna be like money from home.

			O'DANIEL 
	Money from home, see, there's your
	strength, you put things in earthy
	terms any man can understand, son.
	I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm
	gonna run you ragged!

Joe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air.
O'Daniel laughs with him.

			O'DANIEL (CONT'D)
	You're a wonderful boy. You'n me
	gonna have fun, dammit, it don't
	have to be joyless. Say, why don't
	we get right down on our knees now?

			JOE
	Get down -- where?

			O'DANIEL 
	Right here, why not? I prayed in
	saloons, I prayed in the street, I
	prayed an the toilet. He don't care
	where, what He wants is that
	prayer.

O'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an
electric cord. He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off
the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic
Jesus glows on the dresser. O.S. a revivalist congregation
sings. And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns
and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner
evangelist.

			JOB 
	Shee-it...

			O'DANIEL 
	That's the ticket, just open your
	heart and let it flow. It ain't the
	words, it's the love beyond 'em!

EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME

Sally Buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned
preacher stands in the river, preparing to immerse little
Joe.

			O'DANIEL'S VOICE 
	Don't fight it, boy!

INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

O'Daniel tries to pull Joe down beside him.

			O'DANIEL 
	Pray and you shall be heard!

EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME

Camera becomes little Joe, glimpsing the fevered faces of
Sally Buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank,
just before being plunged under the river. O'Daniel's voice
reechoes, filtered through water.

			O'DANIEL
	Don't be frightened, son!

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued
by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation.

			O'DANIEL
	Don't run from Jesus!

Joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a
newsstand. There is a picture of Joe being led away by two
deputies, under a headline ALABAMA MURDERER SHOTGUNS ELEVEN.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly
as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a
large convertible. Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but
stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the
front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand.

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull. The
BARTENDER doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe
approaches.

			JOE
	Say, you know that runty little
	bastard I was with?

			BARTENDER
	I don't know nothing.

Joe tenses as he sees the . tabloid picture of himself on the
back of the bartender's paper. Joe's hand closes around an
empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the
surface. O.S. women scream.

INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME

Reflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing
bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women
screaming O.S. -- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which
shatters the mirror and his own image.

INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT

The empty beer bottle stands where it was. Joe has
disappeared. On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out
by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph,
revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Colorful lights still flash seductive promise. The vertical,
lights on the MONY tower reach bottom and freeze momentarily.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe at his hotel window staring out blankly. Gun fire O.S....

INT. SHOOTING GALLERY - DAY

The radio at Joe's ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat,
shooting alone in the gallery.
Two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks. Joe
moves on, unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay
phone.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his
radio on the night stand. O.S. his love theme, remote,
hollow...

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe's radio is at his ear "... never too late to look great,
Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a.m., miles and
miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks
and nobody walks." For the first time, Joe is aware of the
other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways, the cruising
queens, the middle-age men in sport shirts. Joe moves on self
consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously
massaging his night stick. Camera holds on a window display
of gag buttons, featuring NEW YORK WILL BREAK YOUR HEART,
BABY.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe soaking in the tub, eyes closed.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE DANCE HALL - DAY

Joe's radio promises job opportunities for young men eighteen
to twenty-five in the U.S. Air Force. He stands with a crowd
staring up at a girl go-go dancing in the window of SERGEANT
PEPPER'S LONELY HEART CLUB.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe staring in the mirror. O.S. static over his love theme.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

By work-light, the tarrier in metal helmet leans on a jack
hammer, beyond the sign DIG WE MUST, drowning out Joe's
radio.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe flexing his muscles in his jockey shorts while -- LIVE ON
TV SCREEN -- a physical culture personality finishes push-ups
and starts pitching his own extra protein bread.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry
cook flips flapjacks in the window.
But Joe's eyes are on a sign DISHWASHER WANTED. Joe looks up
and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage
behind the counter. It's Joe.

			JOE 
	Shee-it.

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street,
unable to concentrate on his comic book. On two-way radio, a
woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When I can't sleep,
well, I just dial the time and listen to those old seconds
clicking by like, you know, counting sheep?"

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - COCKTAIL HOUR

Joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady,
at the same corner where Ratso waved to another young man.
The woman's predatory eyes linger momentarily on Joe before
she leads the young man into the Cafe. The two-way radio
continues over, "... that's what I do about insomnia."

			JOE 
	Well, now, ma'am, next time you got
	that feeling coming on, you dial
	Joe Buck. I'll show you what to
	do...

STILL PHOTOGRAPH

Joe straddles a chair, staring at a blank TV screen.

			SINGING COMMERCIAL 
	Need a little easy money? It's E-Z.
	Want a little easy cash? It's E-Z.

E-Z LOAN COMMERCIAL

As the jingle continues, we follow Joe and his radio into the
loan office, the depressing reality photographed and edited
in the style of a TV commercial:

			JINGLE 
	Easy locations to get to 
	Easy ladies to greet you 
	Easy chairs to seat you 
	Easy payments to meet 
	Let E-Z set you 
	On Easy Street 
	Joe arrives confident      
	Harassed E-Z receptionist     
	Lines of uneasy customers       
	Desperate, angry faces	
	Reams of E-Z forms to fill  
	Clerk's sneer, says		
	Joe has to be kidding

INT. TIMES SQUARE PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT

Joe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph -
standing at the desk, waiting for his key.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Key to 1014...

Action continues as the DESK CLERK hands Joe a folded paper
instead of a key. Joe opens it, deeply perplexed.

			DESK CLERK 
	Looks like you been locked out of
	your room, buddy. Till you pick up
	your tab.

			JOE
	Uh, what about my things'n all?

			DESK CLERK 
	We keep them nice and safe till you
	get this straightened out.

INTERCUT

Room 1014 warm and inviting, Joe's suitcase on the bed.

			JOE 
	Listen, tell you what, you can keep
	all the rest of the goddam junk if
	you let me have just the suitcase.
	That suitcase means a lot to me.

INTERCUT

The postcard photograph marked X -- THIS IS ME.

			DESK CLERK
	We keep everything. House rules.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Joe stands outside the hotel, stunned, seeing the bright
colored lights turn suddenly grey. The film continues in
black and white as Joe walks into the crowd.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

The FOR RENT sign flapping in the wind.

INT. BAR - DAY

Joe nurses a short beer, like the regulars. He looks up as a
crippled panhandler approaches, vaguely reminiscent of Ratso.

			JOE 
	Screw off.

INT. ROOM 1014 - NIGHT

The bed turned back, clean sheets, a soft night light.

INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

Joe is stretched on a bench, his Stetson over his eyes. A
loud speaker announces a bus "departing for Texas" but Joe
does not move. A policeman taps Joe's boots with his night
stick. Joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and
apprehension.

INT. PUBLIC MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Two matching Ivy Leaguers exchange a glance as they see Joe
washing his feet in the basin. Joe stares back with a
belligerent grin.

			JOE
	Any objection, gentlemen?

INT. ALL NIGHT CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Joe balances a cup of coffee, walking past the other solitary
night people, avoiding each other's eyes. Joe spots what he's
looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her
ten year old son, both freaked out, erratically touching
things, themselves, each other in a futile effort to make
contact with reality. But Joe is only concerned with the
plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls.

			JOB
	Y'ain't gonna eat them?

The woman stares at Joe blankly. The boy runs a toy mouse
across the table, up his mother's arm and around her face.
With a polite nod, Joe opens the crackers and squirts one
with ketchup. Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup
spills onto his pants...

			JOE
	Shee-it.

... glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only
one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick.
Joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water
dispenser, wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the
stain. But the water has only spread the stain across his
pants and down his leg. He blushes as a blonde young
streetwalker giggles.

			SALLY BUCK'S VOICE
	Wet your britches, lover boy?

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

Joe tries to hide the stain with his jacket as he checks the
coin boxes of vending machines, wary as he passes a burly
policeman, abstractedly snapping his handcuffs in front of a
bakery window display of bride-and-groom wedding cakes. Joe
barely glances at a confused MIDDLE-AGE LADY.

			MIDDLE-AGE LADY
	How do I get to Grand Central?

			JOE
	Shuttle. Follow the green light.

Automatically,checking the trough of a gum vending machine,
Joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror, the eyes
staring at him tired and hopeless. His hand reaches
unconsciously for a cigarette, The package is empty. He
crumples it in his fist but holds it.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Alright, cowboy. Enough of this
	shee-it. You know what you got to
	do? 
		(nods)
	Then go do it.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe hurls the crumpled package into a DON'T BE A LITTERBUG
basket as he emerges from the subway, his radio at his ear.
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street
noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a
policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for
the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising
but threatening, clashing, warning as...

... from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other
midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers. His figure
is momentarily obliterated by traffic then...

... zooming in, we see Joe self-consciously trying to hide
the stain on his pants, embarrassed as a large sedan slows
then moves on to stop in front of a motorcycle freak. Joe is
briefly obliterated again by a passing police car...

... the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in
close conversation with a frightened young FAT BOY, whose
eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls.

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

Joe's black and white suitcase gleams on the bed.

			JOE'S VOICE
	Twenty-three bucks, I got to have
	twenty-three bucks...

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

From an apparently empty balcony -- an old science fiction
film grinds endlessly through the night -- a lost spaceman
trying to make contact with a tantalizing Martian maiden
across an invisible time barrier, theremin voices calling,
"Earthling, where are you?"

			FAT BOY'S VOICE 
	Okay. Sure. I got twenty-five...

At the top of the balcony, Joe leans back, turning his face
away as the Fat Boy embraces him, kissing Joe's cheek and
neck, his head moving down out of frame to show -- on the
screen -- the spaceman and Martian maiden meeting, arms
outstretched. But the Martian maiden moves right on through
the spaceman, crying, "Earthling come back, however many
centuries it is, I'll wait!" Joe closes his eyes, forcing his
memory back...

INT. REMEMBERED MOVIE HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME

... repeating the remembered image of Anastasia and a younger
Joe, behind the movie screen...

			ANASTASIA 
	You're the only one, Joe, the only,
	only one ever!

... the remembered passion continuing, mounting -- intercut
with flash impressions, like flipping pages of a nudie
magazine -- naked, half-draped blondes gazing into camera
with sultry eyes, including one comic strip sexpot and the
calendar girl in Joe's Texas hotel room...

			ANASTASIA'S VOICE
	You're the best, the very best,
	yes, yes, kiss me, oh God please
	kiss me, Joe, now, now, now!

... Joe's face in extreme close-up, sounds of both movie
houses merging, confused, dominated by the voices of
adolescent boys...

			BOYS' VOICES 
	Hey, Joe, give someone else a
	chance! What's he doing for
	chrisake? He kissing Anastasia? You
	better swallow a whole goddam
	drugstore, man!

... an adolescent ratpack waiting in line behind the screen,
laughing in coarse whispers, watching Joe and Anastasia. O.S.
theremin voices call "Earthling, where are you?"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

On screen, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman,
crying, "Earthling, come back, however many centuries it is,
I'll wait!"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE RESTROOM - NIGHT

Joe watches the Fat Boy doubled over, retching.

			JOE
	I'm awful damn sorry you're sick,
	kid, but you gonna have to gimme
	that money like you said.

			FAT BOY 
	I was lying. I don't have it.
	What're you going to do to me?

			JOE 
		(controls fury)
	What you got in your pockets?

Eagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway
token, a dirty handkerchief. Joe grabs his wrist, revealing a
watch.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	How much's that worth?

			FAT BOY 
	I can't go home without my watch!
	My mother'd die! She'd die! Take my
	books! Not my watch! She'd die!

But Joe has already kicked open the door. Theremin voices
drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you?"

INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT

Joe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail,
the radio at his ear. On screen, once again, the Martian
maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the
voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio. As she speaks, a
policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his
night stick.

			DESPERATE VOICE 
	Bill, can I call you Bill, Mister
	Bonner? I feel like I know you from
	listening. What I called about,
	Bill, I'm gonna kill myself...

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

From a high angle, only Joe's Stetson and radio can be seen
above a passing bus, its side panel advertising BILL BONNER'S
STRAIGHT LINE, A STRAIGHT TALK SHOW.

			BONNER'S VOICE 
	Why call me, baby? If you want to
	do it; just do it, don't talk about
	it. Are we drunky? Feeling a little
	sorry for ourselves maybe?

Joe appears in full figure as the bus passes. He stands
looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window.

			DESPERATE VOICE 
	Well, Bill, what I got thinking, I
	didn't want the neighbors to have
	to find me, this young couple with
	the boy I want to have my cat, see,
	Bill?

INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

BONNER, tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone.

			BONNER 
	Okay, baby, now listen, just hold
	on while I leave the line for a
	minute. And think about all the
	kids that are dying overseas for
	you, okay, baby? Got that? I'll be
	back in exactly sixty seconds.
	After this message from...

A taxi born blasts, interrupting the sponsor's message.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake
injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street
toward...

EXT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of
lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe
outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their
conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic
-- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something
like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend...

INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.

			RATSO 
	Don't hit me, I'm a cripple.

Joe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder.

			JOE 
	Oh, I ain't gonna hit you, I'm
	gonna strangle you to death...

The cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip. He jerks
spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the
butt and drops it in his coffee cup.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	... only first I'm gonna turn you
	upside down and shake you out right
	here and now.

Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the
counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of
gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and
two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe
kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer.

			JOE 
	What's in your socks?

			RATSO 
	Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear
	on my mother's eyes.

Ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the
counter man. His socks don't even conceal his toes.
Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	You keep the sixty-four cents. I
	want you to have it.

			JOE 
	It's sticky. What you do, slobber
	on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.

Joe should leave -- Ratso obviously has nothing tangible to
offer -- but Joe hesitates, lighting a cigarette as Ratso
pulls on his loafers.

			RATSO 
	How do you like that O'Daniel,
	flipping out like that? I wanted to
	get in touch with you when I heard,
	but I been laid up with this
	cold...

Ratso touches his chest, forcing a cough which continues
itself beyond his intention.

			JOE 
	You want some free medical advice,
	shut your goddam mouth about that
	night.

			RATSO 
	Okay, right, right, okay. Another
	subject. Where you living? Still at
	the hotel?

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

The black and white suitcase lies open on the bed.

INT. NEDICK'S - DAY

Joe turns abruptly and walks away.

			JOE 
	Shee-it. I got better things to do
	than talk to you.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY

Joe strides north, pretending he doesn't hear...

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	Hey, wait up, for crissake!

... Ratso hop-skipping to overtake Joe at the traffic light.

			JOE 
	Listen, keep away from me, hear?
	You come near me again, I snatch
	you bald-headed!

			RATSO 
	I'm inviting you. I mean if you're
	not located, I got a place. I'm
	inviting you, goddamit.

			JOE 
	You inviting shee-it.

EXT. TENEMENT STREET - DAY

A contractor's sign announces LUXURY APARTMENTS AVAILABLE in
high-rise co-op, under construction beyond a raw of tenements
with X's taped on the windows. Ratso's voice continues over
the click-clack-click of Joe's boots and the flip-flap-squeak
of Ratso's loafers as camera moves toward a condemned
building.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	The X on the window means the
	landlord can't collect rent --
	which is a convenience, hey? -- on
	account of it's condemned.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Footsteps climb past rubbish piled outside empty flats.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	The electric's off. Another
	convenience.
	I don't mess with Con Edison, hey?
	What the hell, I got candles,
	right?

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as
Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely
furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a
burnt-out mattress.

			RATSO 
	I got no heat, but by that time,
	you know, cold weather, hey, I'll
	be in Florida. Stretch out. Make
	yourself comfortable. You hungry?
	I'll put up some water for coffee.

Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno
stove. Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to
test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him
suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to
restrain a large, comfortable yawn.

			JOE
	Comfortable, kee-rist, I slept on
	subways softer than this.

Joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily.
The sounds of the city recede. Joe's love theme plays softly
on a distant radio. Joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of
him elf.

INT. REMEMBERED CAR - ANOTHER TIME

A vintage dashboard, radio dial glowing, Anastasia's face.

			ANASTASIA
	Love me, Joe?

EXT. DEMOLITION SITE - DAY

A huge metal ball arcs on chain, demolishing a brick facade.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Ratso's face seems to radiate evil as he lights a Sterno can.
Joe forces his eyes half-open.

			JOE
	Smart thing for me to do is haul
	ass outta here.

			RATSO
	Whatsa matter now?

Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but
the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back.

			JOE 
	You don't seem like no fag...

			RATSO 
	What's that supposed to mean?

Joe's eyes close, his voice continuing out of half-sleep.

JOE 

Want me to stay here, y'after something. What y'after?

INT. REMEMBERED CAR - NIGHT

Joe's thumbnail flares a match, exposing Anastasia on the car
seat with Joe, both nearly naked. Anastasia butterfly-kisses
Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette.

ANASTASIA

Say you love me. Just say it.

JOE

Okay. I love you.

Anastasia purrs as her lips find Joe's breast, trying to
nurse. A flashlight flares suddenly through the car window.

NIGHTMARE - MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN

Low angle Ratso bending over Joe, into camera...
... Sally Buck shocked, hand still on switch... 
... Joe blinded by halation... 
... Anastasia's mouth screaming soundlessly...

Siren screaming -- Anastasia staring catatonic from rear
window of ambulance...
... ambulance racing away... 
... Joe chasing naked after ambulance... 
... running into the arms of the police... 
... Ratso laughing as police beat Joe...

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe awakens in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets, wild-eyed
as he sees Ratso at the table, examining Joe's radio by
candle-light. Joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio
from Ratso's hands.

			RATSO
	For crissake!

Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet.

			JOE
	Where's my boots -- ?

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

Joe facing the crowd, naked except for his boots.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Ratso points to the boots on the floor by the mattress.

			JOB
	How'd they get off me?

			RATSO
	I took 'em off.

			JOE
	What for?

			RATSO
	So you could sleep! I mean Christ!

Joe inspects the boots, seats himself on a battered Army cot 
- which has been added while he slept -- swinging a boot by
its strap, considering whether to stay or go.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	I drug in a cot, if you want to
	stay.

			JOE 
	Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you
	something for your own good, only
	first gimme a cigarette.

Ratso offers a cigarette from his crushed package, Joe
strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up, staring at
Ratso.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	You want me to stay here tonight,
	is that the idea?

			RATSO 
	I ain't forcing you, like, I mean,
	who's forcing you?

			JOE 
	Oh. Guess I got the wrong
	impression.

Joe makes a slow move to pull on one boot.

			RATSO 
	I want you to stay, okay? I goddam
	invited you, didn't I?

			JOE 
	Well, I hope you know what you're
	in for. I'm a very dangerous
	person. Someone does me bad like
	you. If I caught up with you that
	night, there'd be one dead Ratso
	long about now. Hear?

			RATSO 
	I'm impressed. You're a killer.

			JOE 
	So if you want me to hang around
	for a few days, I thought you
	should know.

Joe yawns, picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the
cot. He puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Property of the YMCA. You make me
	wanna puke sometimes, Ratso.

Ratso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets.

			RATSO 
	Joe -- do me one favor -- this is
	my place, am I wrong? You know, in
	my own place my name ain't Ratso. I
	mean it so happens my name is
	Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

			JOE 
	Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.

			RATSO 
	Rico then, at least call me Rico in
	my own goddam place.

			JOE 
	Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?
		(then)
	And keep your meat hooks off my
	radio.

EXT. VEGETABLE MARKET - DAY

Ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several
sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk
vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies,
testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back --
till the GREENGROCER spots him.

			GREENGROCER 
	You! Out! Out! I told you, I calla
	cops!

The other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding
involvement. As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into
the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile.

			JOE 
	Hey, looka here, that ain't nice,
	picking on a cripple...

Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then
ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury. Camera
holds on a tray of coconuts.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the
fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of
rusty tools in an old cigar box.

			RATSO 
	The two basic items necessary to
	sustain life are sunshine and
	coconut milk. That's a known fact.
	If I can find the goddam hole the
	milk squirts out.

			JOE 
	This is an okay setup you got here,
	but I'd say you ain't just exactly,
	uh, flush, is that right or not?

			RATSO
	I been sick. Hold this, will ya?

Joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso
tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	In Florida, they come smooth, ready
	to eat.
	Down there, your only problem is,
	diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to
	wipe warm milk off your chin.
	Tough, hey?

			JOE 
	I think finding you's the smartest
	thing I ever did, for both of us.
	You just the crooked kinda sneaky
	little sidewinder I need to get me
	hustling in this town. Hey!

Joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick.
The coconut bounces on the floor. Ratso picks it up, holds
it, while Joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a
hammer.

			RATSO 
	Miami Beach is the only place for a
	real hustler. Florida has more rich
	chicks per square yard than any
	resort spot in the world. They lie
	out in their pagodas and pergolas
	waiting to grab the first jockstrap
	that passes.

			JOE 
	What's all this sweet talk about
	Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a
	stable down there now?

Joe swings violently. Ratso yelps, hopping on his one good
leg, sucking his thumb.

			RATSO 
	Cowboy killers! Break my finger,
	Christ! I got news for you, baby,
	no chick with any class buys that
	big dumb cowboy crap...

Ratso holds his thumb under the tub-sink faucet.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	... the cowboy bit's out, except
	among fags of a certain type, which
	take a certain, type hustler to
	exploit. Like I could handle it --
	being a stealing operation
	basically -- but take your average
	fag, very few of them want a
	cripple.

Joe holds the coconut like Yorick's skull, thinking hard.*

			JOE 
	Well, I am dumb, that's for sure. I
	don't talk right. I can't think too
	good. Just only one thing I ever
	been good for's loving. Women go
	crazy for me. Fact. Crazy Annie.
	Had to send her away. So I don't
	cash in on that, what am I? I'm
	shee-it. May's well flush me down
	that hole with the dishwater.

Joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands
while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	That's why you gonna stop crapping
	about Florida and get your skinny
	butt moving to earn twenty bucks
	worth of management you owe me...

INT. ROOM 1014 - DAY

The suitcase lies open, displaying Joe's wardrobe.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Make that twenty-three bucks.

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe slams his heel down. The coconut shoots out from under
him and he lands on his ass.

			RATSO 
	Look at yourself, Joe, no offense,
	but frankly, you're beginning to
	smell. For a stud in this town
	that's a handicap.

			JOE 
	You talk like a man with a tin
	twat.

Ratso sets the coconut on the window sill, balancing it as he
raises the X window.

			RATSO 
	You ain't got a chance in hell. You
	need threads and glitter, baby. A
	front, hey?

			JOE 
	Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage
	all that crap, or else he gonna get
	a coconut up his flue.

Joe slams, the window down. The coconut flies down to crash
O.S. on the sidewalk below.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

An alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY

Joe stands naked in the middle of traffic. A siren shrills.
Anastasia, catatonic in a hospital smock, moves toward Joe
like a sleepwalker, passing through him.

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Wearing only his boots, Joe sits like an Indian chief,
wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso,
spotting Joe's jacket, slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid --
his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady. As she starts to
load a coin cleaning machine, Ratso intervenes solicitously,
speaking in Italian...

			RATSO 
	A woman in your condition shouldn't
	do that. Let me help...

... adroitly slipping Joe's cleaning in with her load as she
turns to seat herself beside Joe.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	It ain't right, stealing from a
	pregnant lady.

INT. HAT CLEANERS - DAY

Joe and Ratso stand waiting at the counter.

			RATSO 
	What did it cost her? The
	laundromat syndicate lost a couple
	coins. I'm crying.

The owner brings Joe's clean and blocked Stetson from the
rear of the shop. Joe sets it on his head and examines
himself in a mirror as the owner hands Ratso, the bill.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Where's mine? The black homburg? I
	brought it in the same time.

The owner glances at the slip, puzzled, returns to the rear
of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg. Ratso
quickly drags Joe away from the mirror and out of the shop.

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT

The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso 
- checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach
a shoeshine stand, locked for the night. They loiter till a
young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the
padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and
Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise,
flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz
drummer.

			JOE 
	Hey, you're good! I bet you could
	pick up a living at this if you
	tried.

			RATSO 
	And end up a hunchback like my old
	man? You think I'm crippled? You
	shoulda caught him the end of a
	day.

Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk. Joe laughs. Ratso turns
back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe. Ratso
is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging
his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his
night stick. Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken
padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all
three customers at the same time.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	You think it's funny?

INT. X FLAT - DAY

Joe is seated in a straight-back chair near the X window, a
towel tucked around his neck as Ratso trims his hair, almost
as expert a barber as shoeshine boy.

			RATSO 
	Stupid bastard coughed his lungs
	out breathing that resin all day.
	They buried him with gloves on.
	Even the fag undertaker couldn't
	get his nails clean.

As if by conditioned reflex, Ratso chokes on the cigarette in
his mouth, coughing painfully. He crushes it out, opens the
window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to
remove the towel from Joe's neck.

			JOE 
	Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever
	for a skimpy little gimp.

			RATSO 
	You like it? Take a look.

			JOE 
	Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I
	get myself primed, like I was
	turning on the charm for some
	pretty little blonde lady, then
	kinda mosey away slow and easy and 
	- swing around! -- and there you
	are, you handsome devil.

Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed,
faintly laughing at himself with Ratso. The wall mirror has
been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless
overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions, a tasselled table
cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new Florida tourist
posters, Ratso moves to Joe's side, arranging the
neckerchief, nodding.

			RATSO 
	Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're
	okay, you're okay.

			JOE 
	What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a
	cowboy outta you, kid. How about
	that? Build you up a little, teach
	you couple little tricks'n turn
	y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.

Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's
thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of
Ratso's mouth. Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one
instant, self-consciously, mimicking Joe -- then removes the
hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Okay, you got yourself one
	handsome, sweet-smelling cowboy,
	strut your stuff...

EXT. CONVERTED TOWN HOUSE - DAY

Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into
the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE --
endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering
discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any
language. A large-busted matron, on a French phone, fills out
a memo and hands it to an immaculate young ESCORT, who slips
the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office
and hails a cab. Ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly,
holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the
Escort's topcoat. The young man waves him away with out a
tip. Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab,
unfolding the memo as he joins Joe on the sidewalk.

			RATSO 
	How do you like that? Cheap
	bastard...
		(reads, then)
	I think we struck gold. This is one
	high-class chick. The Barbizon for
	Women!

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DUSK

The Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY.

INT. CORNER PHONE BOOTH - DUSK

Ratso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone.

			RATSO 
	Mr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss
	Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for
	Women. She won't need you
	tonight...

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

A doorman helps a young lady into a limousine.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	Would you believe a whole goddam
	hotel with nothing but lonely
	chicks?

Joe and Ratso watch from across the street.

			RATSO 
	Score once in that setup, the way
	chicks talk, Christ...

Joe cracks his gum, tilts his hat, starts across the street.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	Get the money! Remember Cass
	Trehune? Cash! These rich bitches
	write a check at night, call the
	bank and stop payment in the
	morning. Get the cash!

In Ratso's eyes -- as Joe enters the hotel -- its facade
suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting
in every room.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe starts up the stairs, two at a time. A BELLHOP grabs him.

			BELLHOP 
	Hey! No men upstairs!

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Ratso warms his hands at a chestnut vendor's cart, seeing...

... zoom close-up, a lady in a window grabbing Joe.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe picks up a house phone, watched by the Bellhop.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Ratso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

The lobby watches Joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator.

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

Staring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's
imagination soars, seeing...

EXT. FLORIDA BEACH FRONT - FANTASY

... Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport
shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels...

... Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating
while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg...

... Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a
posh casino, flicking a coin...

... Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the
beach, at peace in the sun...

... the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso.

INT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Joe faces MISS BEECHAM, a reserved and rather plain young
lady in evening dress, She tries to speak softly.

			MISS BEECHAM 
	I'm afraid there's been a terrible
	mistake...

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

Ratso leans against the window, flipping a coin.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

Miss Beecham is flushed with humiliation, the entire lobby
watching Joe in the hands of two bellboys.

			JOE 
	I want my money, goddamit, you owe
	me my money whether you get laid or
	not, lady, shee-it!

EXT. EXCLUSIVE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out
Florida. Ratso glances toward the growl of a siren O.S.

EXT. BARBIZON FOR WOMEN - NIGHT

A police prowl car slows in front of the hotel. Ratso swings
across the street with incredible speed to meet Joe as he's
tossed onto the sidewalk. Ratso picks up the Stetson and
brushes it off, then helps Joe to his feet.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

From a high angle -- the two figures move slowly along the
deserted avenue, their rhythmic musical duet growing more and
more faint in the distance, a broken grasshopper and a six
foot tarnished cowboy -- passing a tuxedo rental store, next
to a lighted sign -- TEMPERATURE IN MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA 89
DEGREES -- their pace slowing to a dead stop...

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

... Joe and Ratso frozen -- rain on the X windowpane freezing
into sheet ice. O.S.
a radio commercial plays warm, sentimental music while a cozy
voice explains how easy it is to heat with Humble oil.

EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY

Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching
the huge metal ball demolish the building next door. O.S. a
radio announcer sells FROZEN SUNSHINE ORANGE JUICE.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe and Ratso frozen, staring significantly at Joe's radio.
O.S. a singing commercial, "Don't wheeze and sneeze the
winter away! Drink Frozen sunshine every day!" 

EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

Through the window -- Joe and Ratso watch the pawnbroker
examine Joe's radio, "Be healthier, wealthier, life can be
fine, when you drink Frozen" -- Sunshine is clicked off by
the pawnbroker.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Joe and Ratso frozen, wrapped in blankets as...

... the canned heat dies with a faint puff...

... water dripping in the tub-sink freezes into an icicle...

... the candle burns down and out, leaving the screen dark.

EXT. CONDEMNED TENEMENTS - DAY

Joe and Ratso warm themselves on the smoke and steam rising
from a subway grating -- watching two officials in fur
collared coats inspect the front of their X flat building.
Reading their doom, Joe and Ratso, continue on, disappearing
into the subway.

EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT

Joe stands alone, watching the midnight cowboys ply their
trade. Camera pulls back as Joe turns away and enters a store
front blood bank, offering ten dollars to blood donors.

INSERT

A huge hypodermic fills the frame, sucking Joe's blood. O.S.
Ratso coughs uncontrollably.

INT. X FLAT - NIGHT

Ratso leans over the tub-sink, dry-heaving while he coughs,
wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him. He controls
the cough with effort -- hearing the door open and close O.S.
-- wipes his mouth and turns to grin at...

... Joe, trying to light the empty Sterno can, deliberately
ignoring Ratso. Ratso shrugs, washes his mouth at the faucet,
finds a cigarette butt and lights it, careful to avoid
inhaling the first puff.

			JOE 
	Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out,
	then light a fag, a goddam fag. You
	make me puke. Where'd you steal it?
	In the movies?

			RATSO 
	The coat? A guy I did a favor once
	gave it to me. Christ.

			JOE 
	Who'd you ever do a favor for? You
	just let some poor bastard freeze
	to death, wouldn't you?

Joe slams ten dollars on the table. Ratso glances at Joe with
curious concern.

			RATSO 
	Where'd that come from?

			JOE 
	Forty-second Street. Where'n hell
	you think it come from?

			RATSO 
	You wanna know the truth? You dumb
	bastard, I got it for you. Look at
	it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too
	big for me.

Ratso pulls off the coat and throws it at Joe.

			JOE 
	Wear it yourself. I wouldn't put it
	on my back.

Joe throws it back at Ratso.

			RATSO 
	Goddamned if I'll wear it!

Ratso hurls it in a corner. Joe shoves the ten at Ratso.

			JOE 
	Go get your medicine. Before you
	die on my goddam, hands...

EXT. EAST RIVER BRIDGE - DAY

High angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind,
neither wearing the sheepskin coat. The Queens riverfront and
factories appear cold and bleak, deserted on Sunday.

EXT. LONG ISLAND CEMETERIES - DAY

Camera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent
housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated
by crumbling boundaries.

			JOE'S VOICE
	Shee-it. I hate boneyards.

			RATSO'S VOICE 
	So split. He ain't your goddam,
	father.

EXT. PROTESTANT CEMETERY - DAY

Ratso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances
around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone
and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a
low dividing wail and swings himself over into...

EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY

... an endless section of plain stone markers. Joe touches
his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at
ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves
except for the name on the headstone. Ratso places the floral
piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity. Joe laughs.

			JOE 
	Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty
	little bastard, Ratso.

			RATSO 
	The name's Rico, at my own father's
	grave, a man deserves some respect.

			JOE
	Respect shee-it! You even steal
	flowers for his grave.

			RATSO
	Can he smell the difference, eh?

Joe reads from the ribbon on the floral display.

			JOE 
	Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't
	'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.

			RATSO
	He can't read. Even dumber than
	you. Couldn't write his own name. X
	-- that's what it ought to say
	there on that goddam headstone. One
	big lousy X like our flat.
	Condemned. By order of City Hall.

Joe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily
depressed with an undefined sorrow.

			JOE 
	My Grammaw Sally Buck, she died
	without letting me know.

EXT. SALLY BUCK'S BEAUTY SALON - DAY

Through the window, past the FOR RENT sign, the tarnishing
driers are lined up like tombstones.

EXT. JEWISH CEMETERY - DAY

Joe frowns, puzzled, as Ratso pulls out a black skullcap,
leading Joe toward a group of professional mourners,
whispering:

			RATSO 
	Just keep your hat on and cry a
	little. They tip you when it's
	over.

Joe and Ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the
grave, Ratso mouthing an authentic double-talk...

... Joe standing self-consciously, aware of the covert
glances of the other mourners, automatically reaching up to
remove his hat, remembering when Ratso elbows him in the
ribs...

... Joe scowling, tight-lipped, embarrassed by the tip that
is thrust in his hand.

INT. LUNCH COUNTER - EVENING

A weary Santa Claus, in a rented beard and over-large
costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup.
Joe and Ratso are arguing farther down the counter.

			JOE 
	Just ain't right, cheating someone
	dead and can't cheat back.

In the background, as Ratso speaks, HANSEL and GRETEL
MACALBERTSON enter the lunch counter, inspecting the
customers one by one. Both wear black turtlenecks and jeans,
dressed as twins, both blond and pretty.

			RATSO 
	You and my old man. Same kinda
	mind. Putting me down till the day
	he died...
		(mimics)
	... why can't you be like your
	brothers? Sons a father could be
	proud of. Yeah, sure. My brothers.
	Too goddam busy making something of
	themselves to show up when the old
	man's dying!

Conditioned reflex, Ratso starts to cough. Joe sees the
MacAlbertsons in the mirror, standing behind him, studying
him. Gretel nods, Hansel hands Joe a large black card,
smiling vaguely, then moves on.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	What was that all about?

Joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly
smiling, turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons, but
they are disappearing around the corner. Joe hands the card
to Ratso.

			JOE 
	You wanna read something, read
	this. I been invited somewhere.

Shocking pink letters on the black card read YOU ARE INVITED
TO HELP US BURY LOVE -- TONIGHT AT BROADWAY AND HARMONY LANE 
- HANSEL AND GRETEL MACALBERTSON.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	They picked me. The only one in the
	whole goddam place. You see how
	they looked me over, up and down
	before they give me that?

			RATSO 
	So?

Joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter. Joe
shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the
mirror.

			JOE 
	Well, this thought just struck me.
	It wasn't too long ago I was
	washing dishes way the hell
	somewhere in Texas.

			RATSO 
	Yeah, well, so?

			JOE 
	Now I'm here. I'm in New York City.
	Getting picked for things. Don't
	you see what I'm driving at?

			RATSO 
	What you're driving at, you want me
	to get lost so you can go to your
	fancy-ass party.

			JOE 
	Did I say that? Did I? 
		(studies card)
	It don't say nothing about you...

			RATSO 
	Don't say nothing about you either.

			JOE 
	But they picked me, right? So what
	I'll do, I'll just say, now look,
	you want me? Well, I don't go
	nowhere without my buddy here.

			RATSO
		(shrugs)
	Well, what the hell, I got nothing
	better to do.

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as Joe and Ratso
run, heads lowered, turning into...

INT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

... a drab entrance hall, dimly lit -- signs identifying
various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading
MACALBERTSON, TWO FLIGHTS UP. Joe has started up before he
notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the
stairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are
wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue.

In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in
Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak
or offer reassurance.

			JOE 
	Better dry your hair some. You
	sweating all over the goddam place.

Joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs
his head dry.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	You got a comb?

			RATSO 
	Don't need a comb.

			JOE 
	Few dozen cooties won't kill me,
	don't guess.

Joe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled
hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the
comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in
place, then looks back into Joe's eyes.

			RATSO
	Okay? I look okay?

In a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a
siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an
electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a
quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling
himself on the bannister.

INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT

A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter --
electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a
step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing
a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the
murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters,
LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the
amplified music.

			JOE 
	Better get a hold of someone and
	tell them I'm here.

Ratso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe
across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random
selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an
underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons
merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with
cameras strategically placed to record the happening...

... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera 
drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a
detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe
and Ratso as they approach.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Well, I made it. This here is Ratso
	Rizzo and I...

			RATSO 
	Rico. Rico Rizzo.

Gretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely.

			HANSEL 
	Do you need anything? I mean
	there's beer and so forth. Whatever
	your thing is...

The twins move away together, pausing to confer with the
operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower
girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a
sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed.
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE!

			RATSO
	If you want the word on that
	brother and sister act, I'll give
	you the word. That Hansel's a fag
	and Gretel's got the hots for
	herself. So who cares, right? Load
	up on the salami...

Ratso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him
but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a
light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies
projected against abstract currents of color and strobe
light...

... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at
a low table, rolling joints for the guests.
She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to
watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what
it is...

			JOE 
	Shee-it, this is one helluva party!

... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques
-- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air -
the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist
who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils
-- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at
the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action
around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a
veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming
her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's
head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face,
spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand,
grinning at...

... a serious young technician handling the light show,
scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh...

... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back
to the crowded loft, fascinated to see...

... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end
of the loft, photographing the scene below...

... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the
style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle,
predatory eyes searching the crowd...

... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the
buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware
of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he
steals, turning away casually, disinterested...

... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black
girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming...

... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant,
reappearing...

INT. MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT

... her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way
-- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be
embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror,
unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly
meeting Joe's eyes.

			SHIRLEY 
	I can tell, can't you?

			JOE 
	Yeah, oh yeah.

			SHIRLEY 
	What'll we do? Leave now or what?
	Your place or mine? Oh God, the
	second I looked at you I knew. Did
	you?

Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her
in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice.

			RATSO'S VOICE
	She's hooked...

INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT

Joe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering
hoarsely.

			RATSO
	... I'd say she was good for ten
	bucks, but I'll ask for twenty...

But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and
Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus.

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
	Did you know? We were going to make
	it?

Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley.

			RATSO 
	You really want to do business?

			SHIRLEY
	Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you
	two are a couple -- ?

The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped
in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs.

			HANSEL'S VOICE
	Why are you laughing, Joe?

Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at
Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body.

			HANSEL
	Are you for real, Joe?

			JOE 
	Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but
	I'm one hell of a stud!

Shirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear.

			RATSO 
	A very expensive stud. And I happen
	to be his manager.

The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly
confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and
out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the
center of attention in his own blown mind...

... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body,
lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...

			SHIRLEY 
	It's too much -- to come face to
	face with a walking talking sex
	fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God!

... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to
remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera...

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE
	I can't wait to tell my man Monday.
	I should be taking notes. Look at
	my arm!

... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh
on her tanned arm...

			RATSO'S VOICE
	I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower
girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing
one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction...

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE
	Eat it -- a man in your line of
	work has to keep his strength up...

... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate,
watching him bite into it...

			SHIRLEY 
	It's fantastic, now I know,
	everything you do has sexual
	implications.
	If I you know, bought it -- could I
	take pictures of you naked? That's
	part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda
	things?

... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to
promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically,
working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to
two girls dancing together...

			HANSEL'S VOICE
	We want you, Joe. You've been
	chosen.

... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors,
two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be
pallbearers. Joe joins them. All lights and cameras are
turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower
girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses".
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
	I had a thing for him. Before I
	knew. Why should knowing make it
	more of a thing?

... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral.

			SHIRLEY 
	Naturally I'll have to ask myself
	why a cowboy? And why a cowboy
	whore? But not tonight.

INT. MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT

Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister.

			SHIRLEY 
	Incidentally, how much is this
	going to cost me anyway?

Joe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats.

			JOE 
	Tell her, Ratso.

			RATSO 
	Twenty bucks...

			SHIRLEY 
	Sold. Let's go.

			RATSO 
	... and taxi fare for me.

			SHIRLEY 
	Get lost.

			RATSO 
	I agree. And for that service I
	charge one dollar taxi fare.

She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso,
takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs. Ratso lingers,
starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose
change.

INT. LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently.

			SHIRLEY 
	Your name's Joe. Which is fabulous.
	Joe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe,
	move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's
	just perfect.

They glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on
the bannister. He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall,
unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself. Shirley
and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the
stairs.

			SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
	He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is
	he all right?

			RATSO
		(rises, mimics)
	Is he all right!

			JOE 
	Well, if you're awright, why you
	hanging on the bannister. Can you
	walk or not?

			RATSO 
	Walk? Naturally I can walk.

			SHIRLEY 
	He's got taxi fare.

			JOE 
	Sure you're all right?

			RATSO 
		(shouts)
	I said yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT

Joe and Shirley are kissing. Shirley rolls away, flushed,
fanning herself. Joe rolls down the window.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT

Joe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson,
bellowing at the snow.

			JOE
	Whoopee ti yi yo...!

EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT

Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb,
whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab. The cab
slows to a stop. Then the driver sees Ratso, shifts into gear
and drives on. Ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for
a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his
way along the deserted street.

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile
hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly.

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE
	That happens. Don't worry about
	it...

Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically,
fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh. Still
avoiding Shirley's eyes, Joe finds a cigarette on the side
table, searches for matches.

			JOE 
	Well, that's something never
	happened to me before, you can bet
	your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the
	matches, ma'am?

			SHIRLEY 
	Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't
	call me ma'am, things would work
	out better.

Joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at
the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at Shirley.

			JOE
	First goddam, time it ever quit on
	me. Fact.

The repressed laugh finally breaks through. Shirley stifles
it quickly as Joe sits up, looking at her.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	You think I'm lying!

			SHIRLEY
		(controls herself)
	No. Of course not. Just something
	struck me funny...

Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely, reacting.

			SHIRLEY'S VOICE 
	I just put myself in your shoes. I
	had this image of a bugler without
	a horn, a policeman without a
	stick, etcetera, etcetera and I...
		(giggles)
	I think I'd better shut up, I'm
	making it worse.

Shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch Joe. But
that doesn't help either. He reacts sharply.

			SHIRLEY 
	Maybe we should take a little nap,
	see what happens?

			JOE 
	I ain't sleepy.

			SHIRLEY 
	I know. Scribbage!

Extreme close-up of Joe -- frowning, puzzled...

			JOE 
	Shee-it...

... camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game,
spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on
all sides, the object being to build as many words as
possible, Scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the
seconds. Shirley watches Joe's efforts to think with
sympathetic amusement. The only word Joe has composed so far
is MAN.

			SHIRLEY 
	That's pretty Freudian, Joe.

			JOE 
	What? It's a perfectly good word,
	ain't it. How much time I got?
		(glances up)
	Goddam sand thing drive you crazy.
	Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very
	strong point with me. Even in
	school.

			SHIRLEY 
	If you didn't talk so much, maybe
	you could think more.

			JOE 
	Talking helps. Don't talk, you get
	muddled in your head. Hey! Now you
	just look at this here!

Joe spells out MONY, down from the M in MAN.

			SHIRLEY 
	There's an E in MONEY. If that's
	your word.

			JOE 
	M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just
	exactly how they spell it up there
	on that big building, bet you could
	see it from here. M-O-N-Y.

			SHIRLEY 
		(stifles giggle)
	Okay. Never argue with a man.

			JOE
	Y -- what in hell starts with Y?

Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joe's
chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly
into his ear as she speaks.

			SHIRLEY
	It can end in Y day, pay, lay --
	hey, pay lay!

One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident -
disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his
thigh.

			JOE 
	Cut it out. That's cheating,
	teasing me so I can't think.
	Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna
	beat you!

			SHIRLEY 
	You gonna beat me, Joe?

			JOE 
	Beat your butt, you don't lemme
	think!

			SHIRLEY 
	Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that --
	gay fey -- is that your problem?

			JOE 
	I show you what problem --

But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking
his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal
noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat
wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved. Joe's love theme
swells triumphant. At the same time, Shirley half-rises,
trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top. The issue is
joined. Shirley has named the game. Her objective is to force
Joe onto his back. Joe's objective is to retain his
initiative. Camera ignores the classic action on the central
front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical
maneuvers...

... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders...

... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge...

... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth...

... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm...

... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly...

... Shirley laughing triumphantly...

... his hand closing on her wrist...

... her talon-nails clawing the air...

... her toes walking up his calf...

... her legs suddenly locking around his knees...

... her free hand grabbing his hair...

... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back...

... her lips pressing down on his...

... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh...

... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe...

... his hand catching her ankle...

... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams...

... her foot appearing upside down beside her face...

... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood...

... his head rearing back, roaring...

... both rolling to the floor, out of view...

... her feet suddenly flying up into view...

... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket...

... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back...

... her ankles locking spasmodically...

... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping...

... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as
her arm flings itself around Joe...

... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her
ascending shrieks.

			JOE'S VOICE
	Whoopee ti yi yo...

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine-to-five role as
a Madison Avenue career girl. Half-dressed for work, she is
talking on the telephone, her eyes on the open door to the
bathroom, through which Joe's voice continues singing.

			SHIRLEY
	Well, I really can't talk now, if
	you know what I mean, but believe
	me when I say, Myra, it's an
	experience every emancipated woman
	owes herself. I'm not. I'm not
	exaggerating. Well, what's Phil's
	poker night?
		(yells off)
	Joe -- are you available next
	Thursday, eight-thirty?

INT. SHIRLEY'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Thoroughly shaved, bathed and groomed, Joe is sprinkling an
expensive cologne into his boots. He yells back
enthusiastically.

			JOE 
	Well, lemme think now, Thursday,
	eight-thirty, yeah, I guess I could
	be available. Hell, yeah.

INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Shirley turns back to the phone. Joe appears, grinning.

			SHIRLEY 
	Why don't you just come here? I'll
	be working every night this week.
	I'll leave a key with the super...

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Well, ma'am -- Shirley -- I sure
	hate to trouble you, but...

Shirley opens her purse, savoring the moment. As she places
the money in Joe's hand...

INT. MEN'S STORE - DAY

... Joe slaps a bill on the counter, admiring a fine new
cowboy shirt in the mirror, wriggling new white socks into
his boots. Suddenly remembering, he goes to the sock rack and
buys two pairs, one large and one small. Gradually
dominating, Joe's love theme recurs, continuing over...

INT. CHAIN DRUG STORE - DAY

... Joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of
medicine.

INT. CONDEMNED TENEMENT - DAY

Joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on...

INT. X FLAT - DAY

... Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the
stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets, his teeth
chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead. Joe stops
abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition.
They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns
away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove. Joe tosses one
of his paper bags onto Ratso's lap...

			JOE 
	See what you think of that crap.
	I'll pour your soup. Got some of
	that junk you like to swill, too.
	Mentholatum. Aspirin. All that shee
	it...

Ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering,
pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear. He sees
Joe watching him for a reaction. The best Ratso can do is a
slight shake of his head.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	They wrong?

			RATSO 
	No. But while you was buying the
	underwear, I could have lifted the
	socks.

			JOE 
	You couldn't lift fly specks from a
	sugar bowl. Can you hold this?

Joe hands Ratso the soup. Ratso seems steadied by the warmth
in his hands. He nods, sipping the soup.

			RATSO
	But thanks.
		(hesitates, then)
	Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this
	or anything. You promise?

			JOE 
	Yeah.

			RATSO 
	Well, I don't think I can walk.
		(embarrassed)
	I mean, I been falling down a lot
	and, uh...

			JOE 
	And what?

			RATSO
	I'm scared.

			JOE 
	What of?

			RATSO 
	What'll happen. I mean what they do
	to, you know, do with you -- if you
	can't -- ah, Christ!

			JOE 
	Who?

			RATSO 
	I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how
	should I know?

Ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop
over. Joe takes it and sets it on the table.

			JOE 
	Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see
	the doctor. I got nine bucks and
	twenty more Thursday and I gonna be
	riding high before you know it. So
	you gonna get you the best goddam
	doctor in this town and get
	yourself straightened out, that's
	what.

			RATSO 
	No doctors. No, sir. Not me.
	Doctors are like goddam auto
	mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug
	another. Operate for piles and
	while they're there, they unscrew
	your liver. My old man, for God's
	sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when
	he went to the doctor.

			JOE 
	Well, just exactly what the hell
	you think you're gonna do? Die on
	me?

			RATSO 
	I'm going to Florida, that's my
	only chance.

			JOE 
	You know what's wrong with you? You
	got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug.
	How you gonna get to Florida?

			RATSO 
	I'll find the money. If you just
	get me on the bus, that's all I
	ask.

			JOE 
	Just when everything's going my
	way, you gotta pull a stunt like
	this.

			RATSO 
	I don't even want you to go.
	Whaddya think of that? I got other
	plans for my life than dragging
	around some dumb cowboy that thinks
	he's God's gift to women. One
	twenty-buck trick and he's already
	the biggest stud in New York City.
	It's laughable.

Joe sets his Stetson on his head.

			JOE 
	When I put you on that bus down to
	Florida tonight, that'll be the
	happiest day of my life!

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl
away while he waits, hearing a phone ring. Then the phone is
answered by a woman's voice.

			JOE 
	Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah,
	well, when will Missus Gardner be
	home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a
	goddam good friend... Shee-it, I
	can't wait till then...

Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still
talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away.

INSERT

Headline -- WALTER P. BOX TAKES NEW YORK BY SURPRISE.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK

Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes
following a man in homburg and chesterfield.

EXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK

Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a
jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup.

INT. ARCADE - DUSK

Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal
cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me!" as
the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite
applause...

			TOWNY'S VOICE
	Bravo...

... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand
between both of his own, like an old friend.

			TOWNY 
	How are you?
		(more quietly)
	Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
	Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a
	paper manufacturers' convention
	and, frankly, to have a little fun,
	dammit...

Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away.

EXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK

Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder.

			TOWNY 
	This is my first night in town and
	I'll consider it a ghastly omen
	clouding my entire ten days, if you
	don't consent to have dinner with
	me. Anywhere you like...

Towny's mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate, but
his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a
sanitation truck, chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with
tinsel clinging to it. Towny is still talking when they've
passed the truck.

			TOWNY (CONT'D)
	... never mind how you're dressed.
	They know me. I'll say you're with
	the rodeo. There's always a rodeo
	in New York, dammit. Besides, you
	look very elegant...

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

Joe hardly notices O'Daniel on a far cornet, his whining
scarcely audible.
"Ye are the salt of the earth, Jesus said, but if the salt
hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted?"

			TOWNY 
	But, dammit all, I just remembered,
	we'll have to eat in my room
	because I have this phone call
	coming at nine-thirty...

INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

An ancient open cage lift.

			TOWNY 
	What I like about you, you're such
	a wonderful conversationalist. So
	won't that be nice to have dinner
	sent up?

INT. TOWNY'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A threadbare, carpeted but spacious hallway.

			TOWNY 
	Fifty years ago this was the only
	hotel in Manhattan. My mother
	always calls me at her bedtime, so
	I've got to be there.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The room has little to recommend it except its size and large
French window, through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual
tower flashes MONY. Towny waves Joe toward the couch, quickly
slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee
table onto a shelf beneath.

			TOWNY 
	A drink? I've got some nice gin. If
	you'd prefer something else,
	they'll send it up...

			JOE
	Gin's okay.

			TOWNY 
	It's so exciting. New York. The mad
	forward thrust of everything. My
	sense of time here is completely
	altered.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Joe carries Ratso down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese
food, soaked through with brown sauce. Joe finds the last egg
roll and eats it as Towny's voice drones on.

			TOWNY 
	Sometimes it seems to me time
	stopped twenty years ago. There was
	this war, there was this handsome
	young man with quite black hair and
	he was supposed to die. But he
	didn't. Isn't that amusing?

			JOE 
	What?

Towny's dialogue moves out of sync. Towny's eyes seem to look
into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it.
The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe
glances around the room, looking for something to steal,
losing personal contact with Towny, viewing him as an object
to be used for a specific purpose.

			TOWNY 
	Enough about me. I'm through
	talking for the evening. Now I want
	to hear about conditions in the
	West. The romance of the West holds
	a tremendous power over me. Mother
	was actually a pioneer woman, can
	you believe it? When she calls,
	I'll introduce you and she'll be so
	thrilled.

EXT. TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ratso sits an a stoop while Joe hails a cab.

INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Towny's voice is only a shrill monotone from here, Joe
searches with increasing desperation for something of value.
An old electric razor is too bulky for Joe's pocket, probably
worthless anyhow. Towny's array of medicines merely recalls
Joe's purpose.

			TOWNY'S VOICE 
	Mama, a coincidence. Guess who was
	being discussed. Discussed. Not
	disgusted. Discussed! Do you have
	that thing turned up? Why aren't
	you wearing it! This is impossible!

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe lifts Ratso from the taxi and carries him inside.

			JOE'S VOICE 
	Listen, Towny, did I mention I got
	a sick kid?

INT. TOWNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Joe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror.

			JOE 
	Well, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it.
	And I've gotta get him South quick
	as I can...

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe stands in a long line, glancing impatiently at the clock
while Ratso waits on a bench, wrapped in his blanket.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Towny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely.

			TOWNY 
	I was so childish with her.

Joe moves into frame past camera, standing in front of him,
so that we can see the scene from behind Joe's waist.

			JOE 
	What d'you want?

			TOWNY 
	What?

			JOE 
	What you got me up here for?

			TOWNY 
	Oh, difficult, it's so difficult.
	You're a nice person, Joe -- I
	should never have asked you up -- a
	lovely person. Oh, how I loathe
	life. I loathe it. Please go.
	Please.

			JOE 
	You want me to leave?

			TOWNY 
	No, yes. No, I mean yes please go.
	Help me to be good. Come back
	tomorrow. Promise.

			JOE
	I'm going to Florida.

			TOWNY 
	This is terrible. I meet someone
	who -- then -- wait, I want to give
	you a present. For your trip.
	You'll let me please...

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe's face is expectant, next in line at the ticket window.
He nods reassuringly toward Ratso.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint
Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe. His eyes
are looking past Joe, his speech out of sync.

			TOWNY 
	Please take it. You don't have to
	be Catholic. Saint Christopher is
	the patron saint of all travelers.
	I want you to have it. For helping
	me be good.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

It's Joe's turn. The clerk looks at him expectantly.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe's voice is angry.

			JOE 
	Listen, I gotta have money.

			TOWNY 
	Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have
	thought. You shouldn't have to ask.
	That was thoughtless of me. Yes.
	Wait here...

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside
the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman
wearing a hearing-aid.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet
from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back
and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost
knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed
against the table, protecting but calling attention to his
wallet, Towny holds out the bill.

			TOWNY (CONT'D)
	Here. Don't even thank me.

			JOE
		(takes the bill)
	I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta
	have fifty-seven dollars.

			TOWNY
	I simply don't have it, Joe.

			JOE
	Get outta my way.

			TOWNY 
	You're wasting your time. There's
	nothing in there.

Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head
like a bad little boy. Joe backhands him angrily. Trying to
duck the blow, Towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but
grabs the table in his arms, watching Joe out of the corner
of his eyes, whimpering. Joe grabs his hair, turning his face
up.

			JOE 
	Let go. Let go of the table.

Joe slaps him, but Towny clings more fiercely to the table as
Joe tries to jerk it free. Joe strikes him with his fist.

			TOWNY 
	I deserved that, I know I did.

But he clutches the table wildly. His mother's picture falls
unnoticed. Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill
the role Towny has assigned him.

			TOWNY (CONT'D)
	I brought this on myself. I'm
	bleeding, my nose is bleeding,
	isn't it?

Towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood
trickling from his nose. Suddenly Joe jerks the lamp free of
its socket.

			JOE 
	You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars
	or you wanna busted skull?

Towny simply stares at the lamp.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Please let go of that table.

Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of
hitting Towny. Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls
limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed,
laughing and crying hysterically. Joe has to step over him to
reach the wallet in the drawer. He takes all the money --
probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the
room.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

Joe carries Ratso up the steps onto the bus.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Towny's shrill little whisper says...

			TOWNY 
	Thank you, Joe.

... provoking Joe to glance back. Towny is reaching for the
telephone, his eyes on Joe with wild brightness, holding his
hand on the receiver. Joe knocks the phone from his hand,
hits Towny in the mouth, jerks the cord from the wall as
Towny falls -- gagging -- finally dislodging his dentures on
the carpet. Joe stands sick and confused, holding the useless
phone in two hands...

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

The bus driver revs the powerful engine, shifting gears.

INT. TOWNY'S BEDROOM-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

... Joe is about to hang the dead receiver on its hook when 
on sudden impulse -- he shoves the small end of the receiver
into the toothless mouth of the man on the floor.

EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - DAY

The bus roars into the tunnel.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso sit near the rear of the bus. Ratso's teeth
chatter, wrapped in the blanket.

			RATSO 
	Thirty-one hours.

They ride a few moments in silence.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	The trip is. Nine-thirty in the
	morning we get there. Not this
	morning but the next one at nine
	thirty.

Both nod for a moment in silence.

			JOE 
	These guys're good drivers.

			RATSO 
	They gotta be.

			JOE 
	Yeah.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bus tires sing as it speeds South.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have reversed places, putting Ratso by the
window. Joe watches a middle-aged couple try on their new
straw hats, unaware that Joe is watching them.

			RATSO 
	You get your first palm tree in
	South Carolina.

			JOE 
	How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like
	you know that?

			RATSO 
	I read it.

			JOE
	Shee-it. You believe all you read?

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

The metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

Two aging young ladies in brand-new resort wear are casually
examining Joe, along with the other men on the bus, but Joe
is frowning at Ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun.

			JOE 
	If you have to shiver, why don't
	you pull the blanket up more?

			RATSO 
	I been thinking. I hope we're not
	gonna have a lotta trouble about my
	name down there. Because like
	what's the whole point of this trip
	anyway?

			JOE 
	Keep the goddam blanket on.

			RATSO 
	I mean New York's one thing, but
	can you see this guy, imagine it,
	running around the goddam beach all
	suntan and he's going in swimming,
	like, and then somebody yells 'Hey,
	Ratso' -- how does that sound to
	you?

			JOE 
	Sounds like they knew you.

			RATSO 
	Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm
	not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the
	time, okay, do you blame me? That's
	agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all
	these new people my name's Rico?

Joe nods. Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

The bus passes a Florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAWN

Joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see
Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes.

			JOE
	Hey -- whatsa matter?

			RATSO
		(barely audible)
	I'm wet.

			JOE 
	You're what?

			RATSO 
	I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.

			JOE 
	Hell, don't cry about it!

			RATSO 
	Here I am going to Florida and my
	leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest
	hurts, my face hurts, and like that
	ain't enough, I gotta pee all over
	myself.

Joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably.

			RATSO (CONT'D)
	I'm falling apart, that's funny?

			JOE
		(nods, laughing)
	You just -- just -- what happened,
	you just had a little rest stop
	wasn't on the schedule.

Ratso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest
thing they'd ever heard. Then Ratso's face pales as he starts
to choke and cough. Joe pats him on the back.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Hey, what size pants you wear?

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET - DAY

The bus is parked in the distance. Joe comes from a clothing
store, bare-headed, wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt. He
carries the boots, Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a
bundle under his arm. He dumps his cowboy regalia in the
trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the WAITRESS.

			JOE
	Couple crullers'n coffee to go.

The Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers.

			WAITRESS
	Where you from?

			JOE
	New York.

Joe pays. She smiles, gives him change. Joe smiles, starts on
toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished
something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human
contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday
happening.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider
than the others. Joe blocks the view of the other passengers
as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a
Florida shirt. In the middle of the operation, Ratso dozes
off. Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues,
lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist.
Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly.

			RATSO 
	Hey, what the hell you doing?

			JOE 
	I'm zipping your fly, what the hell
	you think I'm doing?

They both smile. It isn't funny enough to laugh at. Joe
arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes,
glances at Ratso and puts it away.

EXT. TRAVELING SHOT WITH BUS - DAY

Palm trees are streaking past the window. The sun is glaring
hot. A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the
bus as it passes.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep. Joe leans across
to pull down the shade. He hesitates a moment, watching...

... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to
work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now
dressed...

... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods
slightly, his voice practically inaudible.

			RATSO 
	Thanks, Joe.

			JOE 
	Shee-it, you know, I got this thing
	all figured out, Ratso. I mean
	Rico. When we get to Miami, what
	I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta
	do that, 'cause see, I ain't no
	kind of a hustler. I ain't even any
	goddam good as a bum. I'm a
	nothing, that's what I am. So
	reckon I'd better go to work and
	get me a goddam job. Okay?

Joe glances at Ratso, but there is no response.
Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face
away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand
as he smokes.

			JOE (CONT'D)
	Yeah, guess that's what I'm gonna
	do.

They ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking
at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades
down. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing
that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward
position. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking
our view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning,
thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises
slowly, starting forward in the bus...

... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with
straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he
reaches...

... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the
Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.

			DRIVER
	Yes, sir?

			JOE,
	My friend's dead in the back seat.

			DRIVER
	Your friend's what in the back
	seat?

			JOE
	Dead. Dead as a doornail.

			DRIVER
	Is this some kind of...

He glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	Okay, folks, everything's fine.
	Nothing to worry about.

The passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to
the rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring
ahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches
Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	Is he kin to you?

Joe nods no.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	Don't you want to close his eyes?

			JOE
	Close them?

			DRIVER 
	Just reach over and close them.
	That's all.

Joe closes Ratso's eyes.

			DRIVER (CONT'D)
	I guess we'll just drive on, right?
	Nothing else to do.

			JOE 
	No, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see
	to burying then.

The Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.

			DRIVER
	Just a little sickness, folks,
	nothing serious. We'll be in
	Miami...
		(looks at watch)
	... in forty minutes.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. Then
he glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it
around Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.

				  THE END
