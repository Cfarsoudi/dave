          EXT. SPACE
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Stars.
          The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
          
          "Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..."
          
          More stars.
          Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas...
          A single planet.
          Drab and brown.
          Moving towards it.
          Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
          
          "...Close your eyes and see it glisten..."
          
          
          EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
          Moving closer.
          The mountains are piles of TRASH.
          The entire surface is nothing but waste.
          
          "...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..."
          
          A silhouetted city in the distance.
          What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
          Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
          Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
          They go on for miles.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH
          
          "...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..."
          
          Something moving on the ground far below.
          A figure at the foot of a trash heap.
          A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash.
          Rusted, ancient.
          Cute.
          Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
          
          Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
          Scoop it into his open chassis.
          His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
          A faded label on his corroded chest plate:
          "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
          
          Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
          Stacks it with the others.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          Something catches his eye.
          Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
          A hubcap.
          The sun reflects off it.
          Wall-E checks the sky.
          
          ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
          
          The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
          
          "...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
          
          He places the hubcap in his compactor.
          Presses a button on his chest.
          The song stops playing.
          The end of a work day.
          
          Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
          Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
          The insect hops on his shoulder.
          They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK
          
          Wall-E travels alone.
          Traverses miles of desolate waste.
          Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
          
          Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
          Buildings, highways, entire cities...
          Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
          "Buy N Large"
          "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation!
          The corporation ran every aspect of life.
          There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
          
          CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
          Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!"
          The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!"
          A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
          
          Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
          Practically falling apart.
          Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
          He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
          Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
          
          
          EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Wall-E now sports the newer treads.
          Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS.
          The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
                                     BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                               (Ad #1: BNL logo over trash)
                        Too much garbage in your face?
                               (Ad #2: starliner in space)
                        There's plenty of space out in space!
                               (Ad #3: starliners take off
                                from Earth)
                        BNL starliners leaving each day.
                               (Ad #4: WALL-E units wave
                                goodbye)
                        We'll clean up the mess while you're
                        away.
          
          
          EXT. EDGE OF THE CITY
          
          Wall-E drives down a deserted overpass.
          Activates an even LARGER HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARD.
          
          CLOSE ON BILLBOARD AD
          
          Shows off a CITY-SIZED LUXURY STARLINER.
          Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities.
          
                                     BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        The jewel of the BNL fleet: "The Axiom".

                        "The Axiom". Putting the "star" in
                        Executive Starliner.
          
          The BNL CEO appears at the end.
          Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Because, at BNL, space is the final "fun"-
                        tier.
          
          The holographic billboard powers off.
          Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
          The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
          Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley.
          
          ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP
          
          Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK.
          A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements.
          A "Buy N Large" logo on its side.
          Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          Pulls on a lever.
          The back lowers.
          Wall-E motors up the ramp.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
          
          Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls.
          KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere.
          The tired robot removes his newfound treads.
          Ahh... Home.
          
          Wall-E motors down the center aisle.
          Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER.
          Jury-rigged to an iPod.
          Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!"
          The image is very poor quality.
          Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC).
          The same song Wall-E worked to.
          
                                        WALL-E
                         [Hums POYSC]
          
          Wall-E opens his cooler.
          Newfound knickknacks.
          Pulls out the hubcap from his chest.
          Looks back at the TV.
          Mimics the dancers on the screen.
          Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
          
          Continues to unpack:
          A spork.
          A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
          A Zippo Lighter.
          
          He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
          They rotate until an empty space appears.
          His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
          The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          
          A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
          Wall-E is drawn to it.
          Presses his "Record" button.
          
          ON TV SCREEN
          
          Two lovers sing gently to one another.
          They kiss...hold hands...
          
          Wall-E tilts his head as he watches.
          Curious.
          Holds his own hands.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
          Pauses to take in the night sky.
          STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
          Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
          The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
          
          The wind picks up.
          A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He looks out into the night.
          A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
          
          Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
          IOTAM still gently playing.
          
          ...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
          
          Wall-E raises the door.
          Pauses.
          WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
          The door shuts just as the storm hits.
          Obliterates everything in view.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - SAME
          
          Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter.
          Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie).
          Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in.
          It happily dives in.
          
          Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube.
          Backs into an empty shelf space.
          Rocks it like a cradle...
          ...and shuts down for the night.
          Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
          He wakes. Unboxes.
          Groggy and lifeless.
          Stumbles outside.
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
          His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
          A solar collector.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
          
          His CHARGE METER chimes full.
          Solar panels fold away into hiding.
          Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler.
          Heads off to work.
          ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach.
          Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
          
          Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread.
          The cockroach simply pops back to life.
          No biggie. Ready to go.
          Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
          
          A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
          
          - CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
            CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor.
            A cube lands by the cockroach.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
            Unsure what it's for.
            Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses.
            Tosses it in his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
            Presses the remote lock.
            Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
          
          - Plays with a paddle ball.
            The ball keeps smacking him in the face.
            He doesn't like it.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
            Throws out the ring. Keeps the case.
            The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
            ...A RUBBER DUCKY...
            ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
            ...An OLD BOOT...
            ...A TROPHY...
          
          - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
            Activates it.
            FOAM blasts in his face.
            It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
            Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself.
            Now what?
          
          - CU on fridge door.
            A WELDING BEAM moves down its center.
            It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
           The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals...
          
          ...a SMALL PLANT
          
          in its early stage of growth.
          Wall-E is entranced.
          Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
          
          CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
          
          Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
          Dusts dirt off the leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
          
          Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
          Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
          Stares at the ground.
          Continues staring.
          
          A RED DOT
          
          quivers on the dirt.
          A single laser point of light.
          Wall-E moves to touch it...
          
          ...The dot races along the ground.
          
          Wall-E drops his Igloo.
          Chases after the dot.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY BAY
          
          The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
          He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
          
          MANY LASER POINTS
          
          coming from every direction.
          All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
          Triangulating towards a center.
          
          Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
          Slowly he reaches for it.
          Can't grab it. Just light.
          ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
          The ground shakes.
          Wall-E becomes confused.
          
          Doesn't see above him.
          The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
          A noise. Building.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          
          Rocket engines.
          Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
          
          Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
          
          Wall-E runs for it.
          An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
          A second column of fire.
          A third.
          Trapped.
          
          Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
          Working fast.
          Noise deafening.
          Heat rising.
          Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
          
          ...Then suddenly quiet.
          Smoke clears.
          
          CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
          
          Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
          Glows red hot from the heat.
          Trembles with fright.
          Everything in shadow.
          Something very big looms over him.
          Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
          Bangs his head on metal.
          
          WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
          Rests ominously in the empty bay.
          
          A PORTAL on its underside opens.
          Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
          Nowhere to go.
          He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
          
          A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
          Scans the surface.
          
          Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
          The device unfolds.
          Wall-E boxes up again.
          
          A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
          ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
          Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons.
          The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
          
          ...a PROBE ROBOT.
          
          It hovers gracefully above the ground.
          White. Egg-shaped.
          
                                                              9.
          
          
          Blue-lit eyes.
          Female.
          Eve.
          
          Wall-E is transfixed.
          Inches closer.
          Watches Eve from behind the device.
          Tilts his head.
          Time stops.
          She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
          
          Eve hovers over the ground.
          A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
          Fans out 180 degrees.
          Scans random objects and areas.
          
          The device rises back into the ship.
          Exposes Wall-E.
          He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
          Never takes his eyes off Eve.
          Watches her float away from the ship.
          ...from the ship?
          The ship!
          
          Engines roar back to life.
          Wall-E digging furiously.
          The rocket takes off.
          
          Smoke clears.
          Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
          Looks for Eve.
          She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
          Waits until it is completely out of sight...
          
          ...then Eve rises high up into the air.
          
          She flies around the bay.
          Soars like a graceful bird.
          Does loops in the sky.
          Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
          He is hypnotized.
          
          Eve descends gently to the ground...
          Wall-E sneaks up closer.
          Hides behind another boulder.
          Slips.
          Makes a NOISE.
          Instantly, Eve whips around.
          Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
          Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
          
          ...Smoke clears...All quiet.
          
          Eve, now cold and dangerous.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
          Scans the area.
          No sign of life.
          All business again.
          Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
          
          ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
          
          Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock.
          Trembles uncontrollably.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
          
          Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash.
          Scans random areas.
          Wall-E spies from the shadows.
          Too frightened to approach.
          She moves on. He follows.
          
          
          EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
          
          Eve probes a mound of tires.
          Wall-E hiding nearby.
          He flinches at the sight of
          
          HIS COCKROACH
          
          innocently approaching Eve from behind.
          She spins around.
          Blasts the insect.
          Wall-E is gut-punched.
          
          The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
          Unscathed. Still curious.
          
          Eve finds the insect intriguing.
          Lowers her arm.
          The end separates into individual hovering sections...
          
          ...A HAND.
          
          She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
          Wiggles into her workings.
          It tickles.
          
                                       EVE
                          [Giggles]
          
          Wall-E relaxes.
          CHUCKLES privately.
          
          Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
          Locks onto him.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          Arm converts to laser cannon.
          Fires rapidly.
          Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts.
          Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
          
          Wall-E now exposed.
          Nowhere to hide.
          Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably.
          Eve holds her fire.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Identify yourself.]
          
          She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
          Keeps her gun trained on him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Repeat. Identify yourself.]
          
          Wall-E peeks out from his box.
          Doesn't understand a thing she says.
          Doesn't care.
          Can't believe she's real.
          The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
          Jumps onto his master.
          
          Eve scans Wall-E.
          A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
          Buzzes "negative".
          He's not what she's looking for.
          She retracts her gun arm.
          Hovers off.
          Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Sigh.]
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY
          
          LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
          
          Eve scans through the market.
          Wall-E follows from a safe distance.
          A stray puppy-dog.
          
          Eve glances over at him.
          Wall-E panics.
          Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS.
          Creates an avalanche.
          
                                                                      12.
          
          
          They chase him down a flight of stairs.
          Wall-E reaches the exit doors.
          Won't open!
          Carts pig pile on top of him.
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E perched on the roof.
          Patiently watches Eve fly.
          She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
          
          Eve comes in for a landing below.
          Shuts down for the night.
          Wall-E waits.
          Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape.
          Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground.
          Eve doesn't wake.
          Wall-E creeps up to her.
          Opens his arms wide...
          ...and measures her.
          Turns to a pile of trash.
          Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
          
                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING
          
          Eve powers up again.
          Does a double take.
          A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
          She hovers away, unimpressed.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
          Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
          They roll on top of him.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING
          
          - Scans a car engine.
            Negative.
            Slams the hood shut.
          
          - Scans a Port-A-Potty.
            Negative.
            Slams the door shut.
          
          - Scans an Apollo capsule.
            Negative.
            Slams the hatch shut.
          
          - Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD.
          
                                                              13.
          
          
           Negative.
           Slams the lid shut.
          
          
          EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK
          
          Eve hovers over the freighter.
          Frustrated.
          Not finding what she's looking for.
          Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
          
          Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
          Gets stuck.
          Wrestles to free herself.
          Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
          The reaction startles Wall-E.
          
          Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
          She gives up.
          Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
          Sits at the other end of the anchor.
          Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
          Then...
          ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
          Musters the courage to speak, when --
          She suddenly turns to him:
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [So what's your story?]
          
          Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
          Me?
          Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:
          
                                     EVE
                               (German)
                        [Directive?]
                               (Japanese)
                        [Directive?]
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Huh?]
          
                                     EVE
                               (Swahili)
                        [Directive?]
                               (English)
                        Directive?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh, I understand that!]
          
                                                          14.
          
          
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
          Scoops it into his compactor.
          Proudly spits out a cube.
          Points to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles to speak)
                        Di...rec...t--
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                       EVE
                        Classified.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh. Sorry.]
          
          She scans his CHEST LOGO.
          
                                       EVE
                        Name?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles again)
                        W-wally? ...Wall-E.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smooth; almost perfect)
                        Wwww-aaaa-leee...
          
          Wall-E nearly melts.
          She says his name so beautifully.
          Moves closer.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E.
                                 (giggles)
                        Eve.
          
          Wall-E tries to repeat it:
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeee...?
          
                                       EVE
                                 (slower)
                        Eve.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeeaaah?
          
                                     EVE
                        Eeeve. Eeeve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eee--vah!
          
          She giggles again.
          Wall-E likes making her giggle.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Eee-vah! Ee --
          
                                       EVE
                        Eve.
          
          The wind kicks up.
          The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He moves to grab her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        (Gasp!) Eee-vah!
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
          
          She draws her gun on him.
          Doesn't understand the danger.
          The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
          Too late.
          Wall-E collapses into a box.
          The storm hits full force.
          Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E? Wall-E?
          
          WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
          Calmly takes Eve's hand.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The back door lowers.
          A rush of wind and sand.
          Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door.
          She coughs up dust.
          
          Wall-E hits a switch...
          Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
          His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
          
                                                                   16.
          
          
          An air of enchantment.
          Eve is taken aback.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Come on in.]
          
          She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
          Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
          Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
          He is compelled to show her everything.
          Hands her an eggbeater...
          ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
          ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
          ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
          ...his Hello Dolly tape.
          Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud beeps)
                        [My tape!!]
          
          He grabs it back. Protective.
          Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work.
          The movie eventually appears on the TV.
          Plays a clip of POYSC.
          Wall-E is relieved.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [What do you think?]
          
          Mimics the dancing for Eve.
          Encourages her to try.
          She clumsily hops up and down.
          Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything.
          Wall-E politely stops her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [How `bout we try a different move?]
          
          Spins in a circle. Arms out.
          Eve copies.
          Spins faster, and faster...
          Too fast.
          Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves.
          
          Eve helps him up from the mess.
          Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off.
          Dangles from two wires.
          Eve GASPS with concern.
          Wall-E placates her.
          
                                                                      17.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [It's fine.]
          
          Feels his way to the rack of shelves.
          Rotates them until...
          ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear.
          Replaces his broken eye with a new one.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME.
          Wall-E freezes.
          He had no idea it could do that.
          Moves closer to inspect it...
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          It's the closest he's ever been to Eve.
          She remains focused on the lighter.
          Wall-E stares up at her.
          ...The tiny flame flickering between them...
          ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background...
          Suddenly, he is moved to express his love.
          Musters the courage to open his fingers...
          ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers...
          
          -- Eve turns and looks at him.
          
          Wall-E instantly chokes.
          Pulls his hand back.
          Eve becomes intrigued with the TV.
          Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM...
          Wall-E watches her.
          His infatuation still palpable.
          Then he remembers...
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          He rushes to his shelves.
          Eve watches him rummage through junk.
          A drum falls down on his head.
          She giggles, charmed by it all.
          Something about Wall-E...
          
          She is drawn back to the lovers on TV...
          ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand.
          A tap on her shoulder.
          She turns to find Wall-E holding something.
          
          The plant.
          
          Eve immediately locks onto it.
          
                                                                    18.
          
          
          Drops the lighter.
          In a flash...
          ...her chest opens...
          ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away...
          ...stores it inside her...
          Then she shuts down completely.
          Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest.
          
          Wall-E is stunned.
          What'd I do?
          Waves his hand in front of her face.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Knocks on her chest plate.
          No response.
          Wall-E panics.
          Gently shakes her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Still no response.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah? ...Ee-vah?!
          
          CAMERA MOVES IN on the blinking green light...
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E places Eve in his charging spot.
          Aims her hovering form to face the sun.
          Waits.
          
          MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE:
          
          - Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat.
          
          - A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon.
            Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve.
            Gets struck by lightning.
            Holds up another umbrella.
            Gets struck again.
          
          - A SANDSTORM blows through.
            Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof.
            Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve.
          
                                                               19.
          
          
          
          - Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest.
            Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY.
            Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY.
            Tries to connect the other end to hers.
            An automatic defense system blows him off truck.
          
          - Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk.
            Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
          
          - Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE.
            Uses an industrial tire as a boat.
            Rows like a gondolier with a road sign.
          
          - Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve.
            Watches the SUNSET.
            Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can.
            Tries to pull out her hand to hold it.
            It snaps back into place, trapping his hand.
          
          END OF MONTAGE
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof.
          The blank Eve floating next to him.
          Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her.
          Still no response.
          Finally, he gives up.
          
                                        WALL-E
                           [defeated sigh]
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E loads up his cooler.
          Checks on Eve one more time.
          Still nothing...
          Heads off to work, defeated.
          
          
          EXT. WORK SITE - LATER
          
          Wall-E simply going through the motions.
          No spirit in him at all.
          Stops.
          Pulls out the Zippo lighter.
          Flicks it a few times.
          A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame.
          Distant rumbling.
          Wall-E looks in the direction of his home.
          A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
          
                                                             20.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh no.]
          
          
          EXT. TRASH ALLEY - DAY
          
          Wall-E racing as fast as he can.
          The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DAY
          
          The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck.
          A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof.
          Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold.
          Wall-E racing in the distance.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
          
          Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp.
          Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship.
          The cargo doors slam shut.
          
          The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up.
          Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship.
          Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him.
          Leads it back to the top of the hill.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay.]
          
          The insect mopes.
          Droops its little antennae.
          Wall-E motors back down to the rocket...
          
          BASE OF RECON SHIP
          
          The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE.
          Preparation for launch...
          
          
          INT. RECON SHIP
          
          Eve is secured into a slot.
          Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES.
          All dormant.
          Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT.
          The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window...
          
          OUTSIDE THE SHIP
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
          ...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side.
          The ship's engines ignite.
          Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support.
          The rocket takes off into space.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF HILL
          
          The cockroach watches his master go.
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP
          
          The spaceship roars through the sky.
          Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's.
          He looks ahead. SCREAMS.
          
          HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES
          
          litter the outer atmosphere.
          The ship bursts through the layer.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The recon ship breaks free of the planet.
          Its boosters shut down.
          Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE.
          Looks back at his planet.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Oooh...
          
          Weightlessness takes effect.
          Wall-E almost floats away.
          Grabs hold of the ship.
          Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        E-vah!
          
          No response. She remains shut down.
          Wall-E points out at the stars.
          It is the most spectacular light show possible.
          And Wall-E has a front row seat.
          
          MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES
          
          - The ship flies past the MOON.
            A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER.
            "BNL Outlet Coming Soon."
          
          - The ship passes by the SUN.
            Wall-E pops open his solar panels.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
           Instantly recharges.
          
          - The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS.
            Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER
          
          A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space.
          Wall-E is mesmerized by it.
          Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead.
          A planet?
          No. A starliner.
          Gigantic in size.
          
          The "AXIOM".
          
          The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
          
          
          INT. DOCKING BAY
          
          TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in.
          It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck.
          The impact knocks Wall-E off.
          He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace.
          
          Suddenly the entire dock comes to life.
          Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear.
          ...Rise from the floor...
          ..Lower from the ceiling...
          It's a cacophony of automation.
          They all attend to the ship.
          
          EVE
          
          and four other probes slide out of the ship's side.
          Suspended in a horizontal rack.
          Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him.
          She remains shut down.
          Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah... ?
          
          A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock.
          A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.
          
                                      M-O
                                (beeps)
                         [Hold up.]
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
          Waits for the FLOOR LINES to appear.
          Depict their exact path of action.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Okay. Go.]
          
          They file out on the line.
          
          A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack.
          M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready.
          M-O scans Eve.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant."
          
          M-O is disgusted.
          Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean.
          A VACU-BOT follows after him.
          Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off.
          
          The cleaning crew waits for probe #2.
          Wall-E studies the routine.
          Figures out a way to climb down to Eve.
          When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3.
          The crane grabs him instead.
          
          M-O turns around to clean the next probe.
          Wall-E is lowered in front of him.
          Boxes up.
          Confused, M-O scans him.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant."
          M-O is horrified by such filth.
          A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
          
          He scrubs Wall-E full force.
          Wall-E's front panel pushes him away.
          Confused, M-O moves to clean him again.
          Wall-E backs away.
          Leaves a DIRT TRAIL.
          M-O curses:
          
                                     M-O
                        [You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]
          
                                                                    24.
          
          
          M-O furiously scrubs the floor.
          Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.
          
          ON FAR WALL
          
          Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall.
          Act like hovering caution signs.
          A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE.
          He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face.
          Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow.
          
          BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E
          
          M-O just finishes cleaning the floor.
          Wall-E is fascinated.
          Impishly makes another mark.
          M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Look, it stays clean. You got that?]
          
          Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face.
          M-O loses it.
          Scrubs his own face.
          
          Gopher and his steward escort arrive.
          The cleaning crew stand at attention.
          Wall-E boxes back up with the probes.
          
          Gopher begins scanning each probe.
          Moves down the line.
          Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe...
          Stops -- Wait a minute.
          Turns back.
          Wall-E is gone.
          Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds...
          Reaches Eve.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her.
          Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT --
          
          The entire dock goes to "Code Green"!
          
          Alarms sound.
          Green lights flash.
          All automation stops.
          
          In rapid succession...
          ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher...
          ...A crane-bot loads Eve...
          ...Curved energy bands lock her down...
          ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat...
          
          It's all moving too fast for Wall-E.
          Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          
                                      WALL-E
                          Ee-vah!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          Grabs onto the back of the transport.
          They disappear into the elevator.
          
          The cleaning crew files out.
          Follow their lines back to their hold.
          M-O stops short.
          Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY
          
          Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT"
          
          The tracks lead to the elevator.
          M-O's neurosis takes over.
          Must clean dirt.
          He makes a radical decision and...
          ...jumps off his line.
          Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass.
          Wall-E hidden behind the transport.
          Peeks at Eve.
          Pets her blank faceplate.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet beeps)
                          [It'll be okay, Eve.]
          
          The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway.
          All following glowing lines on the floor.
          Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth.
          Tries to process it all.
          Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic...
          ...without him!
          
          Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic.
          Timidly attempts to merge.
          Sticks out one tread...
          -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP.
          Wall-E boxes up. Guns it.
          Weaves across all the lines on the floor.
          Bounces off robots like bumper cars.
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          Barely able to navigate the chaos.
          Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION.
          Scans for Eve...
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY
          
          ...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign...
          ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute...
          ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp...
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          
          
          INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wall-E flies up the ramp.
          Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR.
          It blocks his way.
          Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers
          
          A HUMAN PASSENGER
          
          sitting, reclined, in the chair.
          He is large, round and soft - like a big baby.
          Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit.
          The chair seems to be steering itself.
          Guided by floor lines, just like the robots.
          Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face.
          He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well, I've been in my cabin all morning
                        so let's hover over to the driving range
                        and hit a few virtual balls into space.
          
                                     PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN)
                        Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want
                        to do that.
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well then what do you want to do?
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He looks over his shoulder.
          Passenger #2 is floating right next to them.
          Isolated in his own hover chair.
          Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
                                     PASSENGER #2
                        I don't know. Something.
          
          Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence.
          They all exit the hallway. Merge into the...
          
          ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD
          
          Wall-E is in awe.
          Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides.
          THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space.
          All reclined and riding on hover chairs.
          MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions.
          
          Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes.
          Absolutely no reason to ever get up.
          No purpose.
          Every one of them engrossed in their video screens.
          Cocooned in virtual worlds.
          Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS.
          The controls allow them to steer...
          ...order food...
          ...play games...
          ...and most of all...
          
          ...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers:
          
          The CHATTER is deafening.
          No one notices Wall-E at all.
          He drives into the endless human traffic.
          
                                     MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER
                        Bot, over here!
          
          A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger.
          Puts a fresh drink in her open hand.
          Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.
          
                                     MISC. PASSENGERS
                        I can't hear you...I'm in a tunnel.
                        You're breaking up...Oh, okay. You're
                        back. I can hear you now...
          
          They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the
          
          MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS)
          
          A city-sized, mall-like environment.
          All under a GIANT DOME.
          The ceiling simulates the sun and sky.
          A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN.
          
                                                                    28.
          
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Buy N Large. Everything you need to be
                        happy. Your day is very important to us.
          
          Wall-E is gobsmacked.
          A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him.
          Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey, Drink-bot.
          
          Wall-E shies away.
          John reaches farther out with the cup.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!
          
          Reaches too far.
          John falls to the floor.
          Flails like an upside down turtle.
          Unable to stand on his baby legs.
          
          Instantly, SIRENS.
          Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive.
          Block John's accident.
          EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor.
          Redirect the hover chair traffic.
          John reaches out for assistance.
          Nobody notices. Just drive past.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please remain stationary. A service-bot
                        will be here to assist you momentarily.
          
          Suddenly John begins to rise.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Uhh...Hey! What's going on?
          
          Wall-E lifting him up from behind.
          Loads him back onto his chair.
          John doesn't know how to react.
          Wall-E waves hello.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E!
          
                                       JOHN
                        Uhh... John.
          
                                                                       29.
          
          
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                          JOHN
                           Uh no, John.
          
          Wall-E scans the concourse.
          Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL.
          He races after them.
          Abandons the stunned John.
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah!

                                  (small wave)
                           Bye...Wall-E.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It pulls out of the station.
          Wall-E leaps on.
          Barely catches the last car.
          It glides down the concourse.
          
          
          INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER
          
          A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS.
          All wearing matching BNL ONESIES.
          Motionless in their HOVER RINGS.
          They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens.
          
                                        NANNY-BOT
                           "A"! "A" is for "Axiom", your home sweet
                           home. "B"! "B" is for "Buy N Large", your
                           very best friend...
          
          OUT THE WINDOW
          
          Wall-E's monorail glides past.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery.
          Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by.
          Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.
          
                                        SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                           Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.
          
          Wall-E now notices his fellow passengers.
          They all slurp from similar cups.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          Next, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON.
          BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Feel beautiful.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOTS
                               (pre-recorded lines)
                        ...It's the new you...Oh stunning...You
                        look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men...
          
          They pass through the FASHION DISTRICT.
          ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue! It's
                        the new red!
          
                                    MONORAIL PASSENGERS
                        Oooohh...
          
          Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons.
          Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Whoa.
          
          Their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel.
          
          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          
          Wall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him.
          Spots Eve on the other side.
          Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary.
          But her chair moves backwards.
          Smashes Wall-E against the back wall.
          No way getting past her.
          Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention.
          She's oblivious.
          Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:
          
                                     MARY
                        Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me
                        started! Every holo-date I've been on has
                        been a virtual disaster! If I could just
                        meet one who wasn't so superficial. There
                        are no good men out there!...
          
          Wall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest.
          Accidentally breaks it off.
          
                                     MARY (CONT'D)
                        ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled
                        through them all -- (Gasp) What the --?
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          
          Mary's chair shorts out.
          ...holo-screen shuts off...
          ...jumpsuit defaults back to red...
          For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view.
          Her eyes slowly dilate.
          It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time...
          
                                     MARY
                               (mesmerized)
                        Huh... ?
          
          Her gaze falls on Wall-E.
          He waves politely.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
                                        MARY
                               (beat)
                        M-mary.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah.
          
          He points to Eve on the other side of Mary.
          Gestures he'd like to get by.
          She is slow to understand.
          
                                     MARY
                        Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead.
          
          Mary moves her hover chair back.
          Wall-E rolls over to Eve.
          Pats her protectively.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY
          
          The monorail emerges into "First Class."
          A vast, circular plaza of pools.
          Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments.
          Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside.
          All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS.
          
                                       POOLSIDE PASSENGER
                                 (claps; umbrella-bot opens)
                        Shade.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA.
          
                                                                     32.
          
          
          The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower.
          The passengers exit.
          Follow their respective lines.
          Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower.
          Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor.
          
          ON MARY
          
          She is the last to exit the car.
          Doesn't follow any lines.
          Excited by her newfound awareness.
          Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.
          
                                     MARY
                        I didn't know we had a pool!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE LOBBY
          
          Eve's transport enters the cavernous hall.
          A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end.
          A bridge elevator behind him.
          Blocked by a force field gate.
          
          The transport pulls up to the typing-bot.
          Gopher BEEPS.
          The typing-bot responds by typing.
          Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...
          
          Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open.
          The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator.
          Notices Wall-E hiding at the back.
          Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close.
          The elevator shoots up to the bridge.
          
          The typing-bot looks at its hand.
          Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture.
          Huh. Never done that before.
          Tries it some more...
          
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
          
          Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck.
          Marvels at it all.
          His view suddenly goes dark.
          The elevator doors open on...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The large circular room is dimly lit.
          Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other.
          A massive console wraps around its entirety.
          Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights.
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers.
          
          Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps.
          Suddenly the wheel disengages.
          The autopilot (AUTO).
          A single camera eye lights up its center.
          A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling.
          Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes.
          Auto eyes Eve. Scans her.
          Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows.
          
          Auto detects Eve's plant light.
          Goes still...
          Begins computing rapidly.
          The number "A113" flashes on his lens.
          An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.
          
          Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous.
          Without warning, Auto heads in his direction.
          Wall-E boxes up.
          A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him.
          Irises open, like a trapdoor.
          
          Wall-E drops...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          ...and hits the floor hard in the room below.
          Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING.
          
          Auto lowers through the portal.
          A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
          
                                        AUTOPILOT
                           Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
          
          Shoots back up. The portal closes.
          Wall-E peeks out of his box.
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV
          
          PAN across the nautical-themed cabin.
          One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS.
          Their years of service listed below.
          The autopilot in the background of each picture.
          Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other.
          From human to gelatinous blob.
          We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT.
          A blobby Captain.
          It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed.
          
          He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm.
          Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          Activates the POYSC SAMPLE.
          It plays loud.
          The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          -- All hands on deck!!
          
          Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as...
          ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry...
          ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT...
          ...The Captain's bed automatically raises...
          ...Forms into a hover chair...
          The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.
          
                                       BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                                 (pre-recorded)
                          Morning! Just a trim?
          
          Wall-E blends in with the primping.
          Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          (Giggles)
          
          Lines light on the floor.
          Lead his chair automatically to the elevator.
          Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Elevator doors swish open.
          The Captain still half-asleep.
          Claps his hands twice.
          
          On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console.
          Pours a cup.
          CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers.
          The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH.
          Leads him over to the coffee.
          Wall-E stays lockstep behind him.
          Auto glides over to the Captain.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT

          Wall-E hides under the console just in time.
          
          The Captain reaches for his coffee.
          Makes a minimal effort.
          Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward...
          ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
          
                                                                        35.

          Sips his coffee.

          His chair automatically arcs along the console.
          SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.

          Auto calls up a screen on the console.
          Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe.
          Waits patiently for the Captain to notice.
          Finally, the Captain turns...

          ...but then notices the time.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        12:30?!
                               (disappointed sigh)
                        Auto, why didn't you wake me for the
                        morning announcements?
          
          He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge.
          Wall-E nearly collides with him.
          
                                                                       36.
          
          
          Ducks back under the console.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do
                        on this ship.
          
          Grabs a large dial.
          TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it.
          Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise.
          
          OUT ON LIDO DECK
          
          - The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE.
          - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS.
          - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up.
          
          An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom.
          A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN.
          Displays a live video feed of the Captain.
          The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM)
                               (unmotivated)
                        Well, good morning everybody, and welcome
                        to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As
                        always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and
                        sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's
                        log is showing that today is our 700th
                        anniversary of our five year cruise.
                        Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
                        proud to know that 700 years later we'd
                        be...
                               (deflates)
                        ...doing the exact same thing...they were
                        doing...
          
          Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING.
          The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (INTERCOM)
                               (snaps out of ennui)
                        SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your
                        free...
                               (hard to pronounce)
                        ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup.
                        Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto,
                        what's that flashing button?
                               (mic feedback whine)
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console.
          It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
                                    AUTOPILOT (O.S.)
                        Captain?
          
          The Captain turns to Auto.
          For the first time he notices Eve. Finally.
          Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Probe One has returned positive.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Positive?
          
          Auto re-activates Eve.
          She wakes.
          Rises to salute the Captain.
          
          Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy.
          She's okay!
          He is compelled to head straight for her...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But...no probe's ever come back
                        positive...
                               (looks at flashing button)
                        ...before.
          
          The flashing button is practically calling to him.
          Can't resist. Presses it.
          Instantly SHADES close on all the windows.
          The room goes dark.
          
          ...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again...
          
          A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him.
          Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Greetings and congratulations, Captain!
                        If you're seeing this, that means your
                        Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,
                        or...
                               (air quotes)
                        ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth
                        with a confirmed specimen of ongoing
                        photosynthesis!
          
          The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen.
          Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        That's right, it means it's time to go
                        back home!
          
                                                                     38.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (nervous)
                        Home? W-w-we're going back?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Now that Earth has been restored to a
                        life-sustaining status, by golly, we can
                        begin "Operation Recolonize"!
          
          A section of the console illuminates.
          An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out...
          
          ...into a passing Wall-E's hands.
          
          Wall-E immediately boxes up.
          Holds the manual over his head.
          The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium.
          Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover.
          It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE".
          Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Simply follow this manual's instructions
                        to place the plant in your ship's holo-
                        detector, and the --
                               (bad edit)
                        -- Axiom -- will immediately navigate
                        your return to Earth! It's that easy!
          
          ON VIDEO SCREEN (DURING SPEECH)
          
          An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge.
          The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up.
          A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine.
          A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth.
          
          The Captain listens closely to the instructions.
          Wall-E paying attention as well.
          
                     CAPTAIN                          WALL-E
          Huh?                               Huh?
          
          Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve.
          Heads in her direction.

                        Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity,
                        you and your passengers may have suffered
                        some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few
                        laps around your ship's jogging track
                        will get you back in shape in no time.
          
          The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.
          
                                                                   39.

                        If you have any further questions just
                        consult your operation manual. See you
                        back home real soon.
          
          The transmission ends.
          The Captain examines the manual.
          Holds it out in front of him.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (reads; to himself)

                        Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel?
          
          Auto intervenes.
          Clips the corner of the cover with his handle...
          ...and simply opens the book.
          The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated.
          Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wow... Will you look at that?
          
          ON EVE
          
          Wall-E taps her shoulder.
          Not now Wall-E -- Double take!
          
                                    EVE
                        Wall-E?!
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (tiny wave)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          Eve is in a state of disbelief.
          Shoves Wall-E into the shadows under the console.
          
                                     EVE
                               (hushed; angry)

          Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him.
          Wall-E just stares at her.
          Smitten.
          
                                                                      40.

          ON THE CAPTAIN
          
          He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.

          The bridge suddenly jumps to life.
          Green lights flash.
          A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling...
          ...Scans the entire room...
          ...Identifies Eve...
          ...Rides along the ceiling rails...
          ...Stations itself directly above Eve...
          ...Arms unfold. Position her...
          ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face:

          A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers.
          Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve...
          Her chest lights up.
          The doors open.
          The Captain winces...
          
          ...and nothing is inside.
          
                                        CAPTAIN

                           Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?
                                  (checks manual)
                           Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you
                           change the text again...
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
          Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual.
          Eve is stunned.
          Searches her chest cavity for the plant.
          Then she remembers...
          
                                     EVE
                        Plant! Wall-E...
                               (turns on him)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger.
          Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty.
          Picks him up. Scans the floor.
          Nothing.
          
                                     WALL-E

          Wall-E scared of her.
          Starts searching.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        Why don't you scan her to be sure.
          
          Eve jumps back to attention.
          Auto slides up to her.
          Scans her chest cavity.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is
                        faulty.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, then...we're NOT going to Earth?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                               (shakes his wheel)
                        Negative.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, uh, I guess things go back to normal,
                        huh?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Correct, Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (privately relieved)
                        Well, false alarm!
          
                                                                    42.

                        False alarm.
          
          Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts.
          Exits back into the ceiling.
          The shades rise.
          Lights go back on.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The probe must be defective. Gopher, send
                        her to the Repair Ward.
          
          Eve turns.
          Excuse me?
          Gopher hops to attention.
          Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          Loads her back onto the transport...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have them run diagnostics on her. Make
                        sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!
          
          ...and reveals WALL-E.
          Everyone stares at him.
          Long awkward pause.
          Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain.
          Shakes his hand.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
          Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm.
          The Captain stares at it.
          Turns to Auto.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have "Wall-E" cleaned.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The elevator opens.
          Gopher's transport drives out.
          Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands.
          The typing-bot has now mastered waving.
          Waves an enthusiastic goodbye.
          Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          She gives him the cold shoulder.
          Refuses to speak to him.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          The transport exits the lobby.
          
          BACK UP IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

                        Analyze.
          
          The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light.
          It rotates.
          The captain sits at his vanity console.
          ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN.

                        to as "soil", "dirt", or "earth".
          
          The last word piques his interest.
          
                                    CAPTAIN

          His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Define "Earth"...

          Dozens of IMAGES OF LAND pop up on screen.
          Lush, green, colorful, inviting.
          He's fascinated.
          Takes it all in.

          Glued to his screen.
          Filled with ocean images.

          M-O continues to clean WALL-E'S FILTHY TRAIL.
          Oblivious to everything around him.
          Cuts through traffic.
          Robots crash into each other in his wake.
          M-O doesn't notice EVE AND WALL-E'S TRANSPORT drive past.
          They hover down a corridor, and enter...
          
          
          INT. REPAIR WARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          It's a fully automated clinic for broken bots.
          Day care for the malfunctioned.
          The REJECTS are kept in FORCE FIELD PENS.
          Dozens line the walls.
          
          Eve and Wall-E stop at the INSPECTION STATION.
          Robotic ORDERLY-ARMS activate.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          Watches them systematically check in Eve.
          Perform an I.D. scan.
          Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head.
          A button is pressed on the boot.
          Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Where are you going?!]
          
          The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E.
          He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him.
          Races through the ward.
          Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                               (pre-recorded)
                        Just a trim? Uh huh.
          
          She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up.
          Holds up a mirror.
          Wall-E gasps.
          
                                                                     45.

                        You look gorgeous.
          
          Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm.
          Placed in an empty force field pen.
          Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT:
          ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face...
          Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly.
          Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          
          Eve slides past Wall-E.
          Carried by an orderly-arm.
          Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM.
          The frosted glass doors shut.
          
                                    WALL-E

          INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM
          
          Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots:
          
          - An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends.
            The orderly-arms struggle to close it.
          
          - A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY.
            It bursts into flames.
          
          Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode.
          A series of tests begin.
          Eve is annoyed but calm.
          It's all routine.
          An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm.
          
          OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD
          
          Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors.
          Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE.
          To him, her arm is being ripped off.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          BACK INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry.
          Her insides light up.
          It tickles.
          
                                    EVE
                        (Giggles)

          Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E
          
          Wall-E watches in horror.
          It looks as if Eve is being tortured.
          Mistakes the screeching for her screams.
          Wall-E struggles to free himself.
          
          INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          She is washed and scrubbed.
          A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body.
          It feels good.
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          It looks as if Eve is being beheaded.
          He needs to stop the torture.
          Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field.
          The barrier shorts out.
          Wall-E tumbles to the floor.
          Lands on his "Play" button.
          POYSC blares across the ward.
          The Rejects all stop and stare.
          
                                       WALL-E
                          EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!
          
          Wall-E races to the diagnostics room.
          Crashes right through the glass doors.
          Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms.
          Grabs Eve's separated gun arm.
          Points it at the orderly-arms.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (angry beeps)
                          [Let her go, or I'll shoot!]
          
          His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style.
          Doesn't realize...
          
          ...he's holding the gun backwards.
          
          Eve slowly reaches for the weapon.
          
                                       EVE
                                 ("Put the gun down...")
                          Wall-E...
          
          An orderly lunges at him.
          Wall-E panics. Shoots!
          The gun fires backwards.
          It blasts through the repair ward.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL.
          
          Wall-E shrinks.
          He knows he's in trouble.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT.
          ...All orderly-arms go limp...
          ...The repair ward doors open up...
          ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear...
          
          The Rejects look at each other for a beat.
          Then CHEER wildly.
          We're free!
          
          The mob of robots all rush Wall-E.
          Lift him on their shoulders.
          Carry their hero out of the ward.
          Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm.
          
          Eve watches in astonishment.
          This day just gets worse and worse.
          She flies off after them.
          
                                      EVE

          Wall-E's dropped in front of them.
          Still holds Eve's gun.
          Cowers.
          A TINY ROBOT pushes Wall-E closer.
          Show `em who's boss.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (stern)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Eve catches up to them.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          Snatches her arm back.
          Just as she reattaches her gun...
          
          ...The steward CAMERA EYES take a snapshot of them.
          
          ALL AROUND THE SHIP
          
          Alarms sound.
          SCREENS appear, displaying EVE AND WALL-E'S IMAGE.
          She appears to brandish her gun at camera.
          Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          Their faces now on every wall...
          ...passenger's hover chair...
          ...cabin...
          ...hallway...
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue
                        robots...
          
          BACK WITH EVE AND WALL-E
          
          The stewards prepare to fire SUSPENSION BEAMS (like Gopher).
          Eve realizes what's about to happen.
          Grabs Wall-E.
          Flies over the stewards.
          
                                       STEWARDS
                        Halt. Halt.
          
          The mass of rejects take their cue.
          Robot rebellion!
          They bust through the steward blockade.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past.
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          Match them with the "Wanted" screens.
          Call attention to them. Point.
          Stewards in hot pursuit.
          
          Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY.
          Lets the stewards pass by.
          She glances out the porthole...
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          She can see the DOCKING BAY below her.
          Just under the bay doors...
          
          ...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS.
          
          Eve gets an idea.
          Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway...
          
          INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence.
          Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN)
                         Caution: Rogue robots.
          
          Wall-E points to it.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (beeps)
                         [Hey look! We're on TV -- !]
          
          Eve aims her gun at the screen.
          Blows it to pieces.
          Wall-E shrinks into a box.
          Never mind.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY
          
          Dark.
          The elevator chimes.
          Eve and Wall-E step out.
          Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway.
          Eve approaches "Bay #1".
          She and Wall-E enter...
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eve navigates the dark.
          Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE.
          Fiddles with some buttons.
          
                                                              50.
          
          
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He glances down at EVE'S HAND.
          Privately intertwines his fingers.
          Maybe now is the right moment...
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet)
                          Ee-vah...?
          
          FLASH!
          Banks of controls light up around them.
          
          AN ESCAPE POD
          
          is revealed at the end of the room.
          Its hatch automatically opens.
          Bathes the room with light from its lit interior.
          Eve turns to Wall-E:
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN.
          It displays coordinates to Earth.
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod.
          He happily complies.
          Jumps up on one of the seats.
          Pats the seat next to him.
          Aren't you coming?
          
          Eve remains at the threshold.
          Shakes her head.
          Points to her chest.
          Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
          
                                       EVE
                          Directive.
          
          ...She's not going.
          
          This changes everything.
          Wall-E races out of the pod.
          Boxes up.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (beeps)
                          [Then I'm not going either.]
          
          Eve shakes her head.
          
                                                                        51.
          
          
          
                                        EVE
                                  (gentle, but firm)
                         Wall-E.
          
          Carries his box back into the pod.
          Exits.
          Wall-E follows her right back out.
          Drives behind the console.
          You can't make me.
          Eve sighs.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (frustrated)
                         Wall-E.
          
          The hallway elevator CHIMES.
          They both look up.
          Someone is coming.
          
          Eve shuts off everything.
          Lights go out. The pod closes back up.
          Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall.
          Blend in with the other wall fixtures.
          
          They HEAR something hover into the     room.
          Can't see what it is.
          Then...
          An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over     the console.
          Presses buttons.
          The pod lights up again. The hatch     opens.
          The stranger's SHADOW comes around     the console to reveal...
          
          GOPHER
          
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other.
          Gopher?
          They watch from the shadows as...
          ...Gopher enters the pod...
          ...opens his chest cavity...
          ...emits his suspension beam...
          
          ...and deposits the PLANT.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (excited whisper)
                         Plant!
          
          Gopher exits the pod.
          
          CLOSE ON EVE
          
          She keeps her eyes on Gopher.
          Watches him return to the console.
          She turns to speak to Wall-E --
          
                                                              52.
          
          
          He's gone.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (whisper)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E is inside the pod.
          Picks up the plant.
          Proudly shows it to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud whisper)
                        Ee-vah!
          
                                       EVE
                                 (louder whisper)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Too late.
          Gopher hits a button.
          The pod door shuts on Wall-E...
          
          ...and launches into space.
          
          Gopher shuts off the room.
          Exits.
          
          Eve leaps out of the shadows.
          Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW.
          Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance.
          The plant icon on Eve's chest glows.
          She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK.
          Enters it like a phone booth.
          
          OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve bursts out into space.
          Rockets after Wall-E.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD
          
          Wall-E plastered against the back of the pod.
          It suddenly reduces speed.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Cruising speed.
          
          He drops to the floor.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        You are now free to move around the
                        cabin.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
          Wall-E fumbles to get his bearings.
          Peers out the rear hatch window.
          Sees the Axiom receding from view.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Yikes!]
          
          He clambers up into the pilot's seat.
          Pulls back hard on the throttle.
          Nothing happens.
          Looks down at the console.
          A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Twenty seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Uh oh.
          Wall-E frantically hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button.
          No change.
          Pushes every button on the console.
          Everything activates:
          ...Lights flash...
          ...Oxygen masks drop...
          
          OUTSIDE THE POD
          
          ...Windshield wipers activate...
          ...Flares fire off...
          ...Parachutes deploy...
          
          BACK INSIDE THE POD
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Ten seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Wall-E panics.
          Looks for a means of escape.
          Spots the hatch.
          Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Shoots himself to the door.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
                        three, two...
          
          Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER.
          The hatch won't open!
          
          ON EVE
          
          She races through space after him.
          Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                     EVE
                        No, no, no...
          
          She flies towards the debris field, when --
          
          Wall-E whizzes right past her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vaaaaaah!
          
          He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Uses it as a form of propulsion.
          Eve is consumed with relief.
          Chases after him.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He points the extinguisher the other way.
          Attempts to fly back over to her.
          It's hard to steer...
          
          ...They rocket right past each other again...
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay there! I'll come to you!]
          
          Eve waits.
          Wall-E finally has the hang of steering.
          Fires short bursts.
          Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve.
          Gets extinguisher foam in her face.
          She giggles.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               ("Look what I've got")
                        Ee-vah...
          
          He opens his compactor door.
          Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Gasp!)
          
          ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV
          
          ...Sensors zero in on the plant...
          ...Confirm its authenticity...
          ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears...
          ...Draws directions to the bridge...
          ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"...
          
                                                           55.
          
          
          
          Eve is ecstatic.
          She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam.
          Seals it safely in her chest.
          Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms.
          Spins him around.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E! (Laughs)
          
          Wall-E can't believe his luck.
          Rests his head on her shoulder.
          Bliss.
          
          Eve stops spinning.
          Leans her head against his.
          A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them.
          A "thank you" kiss.
          
          Wall-E's METER spikes.
          He floats circles in space.
          
                                    WALL-E
                              (swoons)
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Come on. Time's a wastin'.]
          
          She reaches for his hand.
          Wall-E shakes his head.
          Holds up his extinguisher instead.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [I can fly myself.]
          
          Kicks on the extinguisher.
          Spins in a pirouette...
          ...and flies away.
          Eve giggles.
          Chases after him.
          
          BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS
          
          The two fly around the stern of the ship.
          Wall-E does a few barrel rolls.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Try that.]
          
          Eve giggles.
          Matches him move for move.
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          The pair fly between the BOOSTER ENGINES of the ship.
          Weave in and out of the rocket flames.
          Bank up along the ship's port side.
          Execute a double helix in perfect unison...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM'S OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
          
          Passengers hover down the hallway.
          All focused on their private screens.
          No one looks out at the stars.
          
          ...except for MARY.
          
          She has pulled over to the side.
          Stares wistfully out the DECK WINDOW.
          
                                      MARY
                               (sigh)
                        So many stars.
          
          Spots EVE & WALL-E dancing among the stars.
          
                                     MARY
                        Oooh...
                               (recognizes Wall-E)
                        Hey, that's what's his name --
          
          She backs up to wave hello.
          Bumps into JOHN'S HOVER CHAIR.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey! What the --
          
          Mary leans over to his armrest.
          Turns off his holo-screen.
          Points out the window.
          
                                     MARY
                        Look! Look at THAT!
          
                                     JOHN
                               (disoriented)
                        Wha...huh?
          
          Wall-E flies past the window.
          A wave of recognition hits John.
          He comes to life, as if wakened from a long sleep.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey... I know that guy! It's, uh...
                               (snaps fingers)
                        Wall-E! Hey Wall-E! It's your buddy, John!
          
                                                                       57.
          
          
          
                                     MARY
                        Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!
          
          They both wave until Wall-E's out of sight.
          John absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest...
          
          ...and touches Mary's hand.
          
          Both turn towards each other.
          They make eye contact for the first time.
          Awkward beat.
          
                                       JOHN
                        Hi.

                        Hi.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E AND EVE
          
          They soar across the Axiom's bow.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto busy operating the ship.
          Doesn't see Eve and Wall-E outside the window.

          INSIDE THE CONCOURSE
          
          The sky dome fast-forwards to evening.
          PAN OVER to the top of the bridge tower.
          The windows of the Captain's quarters are dark.
          Only the FLICKERING GLOW OF A HOLO-SCREEN lights the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (V.O.)

          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT - SAME
          
          The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research.
          MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen.
          Crops, farms, a barn, etc....
          An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.

                        "Hoedown" - a social gathering at which
                        lively dancing would take place.
          
          An aperture opens in the ceiling above.
          Auto lowers down to face the Captain.
          
                                                                     58.

                               (points to images)
                        These are called "farms". Humans would
                        put seeds in the ground, pour water on
                        them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --

                        (annoyed grunt)
          
          Auto rises back up to the bridge.
          The aperture shuts. Lights out.
          The Captain glares at the ceiling.
          Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Psst! Computer.

                        Define "dancing".
          
          BACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side.
          Spiral gracefully around one another.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        "Dancing" - A series of movements,
                        involving two partners, where speed and
                        rhythm match harmoniously with music.
          
          Wall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam.
          He lets it float freely out into space.
          Eve catches him in her arms.
          Wall-E croons.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          Eve scans the Axiom for a way in.
          Notices SPARKS.
          Down on the ship's lower hull...
          
          CLOSER ON LOWER HULL
          
          A REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna.
          Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him.
          It shuts.
          Burn-e bangs on the closed door.
          Stuck outside.
          
                                                                    59.

                          The Lido Deck is now closing...The Lido
                          Deck is now closing.
          
          The last few passengers exit the pool area.
          All wearing the same color blue uniforms...
          
          ...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool.
          
          CLOSE ON FEET
          
          They ripple the surface of the pool.
          John and Mary float over the water's surface.
          Splash one another playfully.
          
                                       JOHN
                          Hey now. Stop that...
          
                                       MARY
                          Make me (giggles).
          
                                       JOHN
                          I didn't know we had a pool.
          
          A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower.
          Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
          
                                       LIFEGUARD-BOT
                          No splashing, no diving.
          
                                       JOHN & MARY
                                 (annoyed)
                          Ahh! Go on!
          
          John splashes the robot.
          It shorts out.
          
          ON UPPER DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck.
          Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS.
          Eve peeks through the towels.
          Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS.
          On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance.
          No way in.
          
                                                                    60.
          
          
          
          A TRASH-BOT passes.
          Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE.
          Eve keys in on the chute.
          It runs all the way up the tower...
          
          ...to the bridge.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He stares at EVE'S HAND.
          Time to seize the moment.
          Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest.
          It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker.
          Puts his hands together...
          
          Eve whips around.
          What's that noise?!
          Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
          
                                        WALL-E
                           E-vah --
          
          Eve immediately shuts off his music.
          Shoves his hands down.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (hushed hums)
                           [Stop it! They'll hear us!]
          
          She places a stack of towels on his head.
          Gestures for Wall-E to stay put.
          Points to her PLANT LIGHT.
          
                                        EVE
                           Directive.
          
          Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone.
          Zooms silently across the Lido Deck.
          Up into the trash chute.
          
          CLOSE ON EARTH
          
          It sits in space.
          The AXIOM glides towards it.
          Something's not right.
          We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...

          The Captain sits by his window to space.
          Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.
          
                                                                      61.

                          Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain
                          we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd
                          cheers]...No it's nothing. I was pleased
                          to do it. It's all about you people --
          
          ON TRASH CAN
          
          NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel.
          Blows the lid off.
          The Captain is stunned by this vision.
          She opens her chest to reveal...
          
          ...the plant.

                          How...? How'd you find it?!
          
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Salutes.
          Formally presents him the plant.
          He takes it in his hands.
          Still potted in the old boot.
          Gazes at it in wonder.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          We can go back home...for the first time!
                                 (laughs)
                          What's it like now?
          
          Eve shrugs.
          Doesn't know how to answer.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for
                          myself!
          
          He turns to his console.
          Hits a button.
          A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel.
          The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device.
          Plays back images of her time on Earth.
          
          A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past.
          All displayed from Eve's POV:
          ...Being delivered to Earth...
          ...Flying above the devastated landscape...
          ...Blowing up a rock...
          ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wait...that doesn't look like Earth...
                        Where's the blue sky...
          
          He looks over to his computer screen.
          The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display.
          Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...Where's the grass?
          
          His face drops.
          Slumps in defeat.
          The dream is over.
          
          ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN
          
          The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays...
          It stirs the Captain out of his funk.
          He looks up at the screen.
          Leans in for a closer look.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...I know that song...
                               (observes the dancers' feet)
                        And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
          
          A rueful smile grows on his face.
          He looks down at
          
          HIS FOOT
          
          It's tapping in time to the music.
          His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands.
          He lifts it up.
          Makes the boot dance.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...You made it somehow, eh little guy?
                        You didn't give up, did you?
          
          As if in response, the plant wilts slightly.
          A leaf drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Gasp!) Oh no, no --
                               (remembers)
                        Wait a minute.
          
          The Captain urgently hovers across the room.
          Eve left alone.
          Her recorded memories continue playing...
          
          ...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment.
          
                                                          63.
          
          
          Eve recognizes the music.
          Watches the lovers on screen hold hands.
          Something familiar about the gesture...
          Looks at her own hands.
          Slowly, she interlocks her fingers...
          ...Eve's eyes go wide.
          This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her.
          
          Her memories continue on the screen:
          ...a tap on the shoulder...
          ...Wall-E presents her the plant --
          ...The screen goes BLACK!
          
          Then...
          
          ...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates.
          
          Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out:
          ...protecting her from the rain...
          ...the sun...the sandstorm...
          ...keeping watch night and day...
          ...trying to jump start her heart...
          
          ON EVE
          
          Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her.
          Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.
          
                                        EVE
                               (soft)
                        Wall-E...
          
          She looks at her hands again.
          
          MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS
          
          Still waiting between the towel racks.
          Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah...
                               (gives up; beeps)
                        [I'll never get it right.]
          
          Becomes impatient.
          Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE.
          Sticks his head in.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        EE-VAHH?!
          
          No answer.
          The chute has an endless drop.
          Wall-E climbs in.
          
                                                                     64.
          
          
          Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place.
          Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters...
          
          OUT ON THE UPPER DECK
          
          A monorail pulls up.
          M-O steps off.
          Still hot on Wall-E's trail.
          Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby.
          Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS...
          
          ...leading to the trash chute.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Ah-hah! Gotcha!]
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain at his wet bar.
          Waters the plant in the sink.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        There you go little guy. You came a long
                        way for a drink of water... Just needed
                        someone to look after you, that's all --
          
          He is struck with a notion.
          Stares out the window at space for a beat.
          Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant.
          Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (to himself)
                        We have to go back.
          
          Activates his chair's call button.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, come down here!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT (ON SPEAKER)
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Eve is still watching Wall-E's vigil on the screen:
          ...playing Pong...
          ...Wall-E etches their names in a heart...
          Eve is lost in the moments.
          So touched.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smitten)
                        Wall-E...
                                     (MORE)
          
                                                                    65.
          
                                       EVE (CONT'D)
                                 (remembers)
                        Wall-E!
          
          He's still waiting for her.
          She turns to leave and finds
          
          AUTO
          
          lowering in front of her.
          Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand.
          "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the
                        Holo-detector.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Not necessary, Captain. You may give it
                        to me.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (not listening)
                        You know what? I should do it myself.
          
          Heads for the elevator.
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                        Captain!
          
          Auto shoots back upstairs.
          Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator.
          Blocks the Captain.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, get out of my way.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, we cannot go home.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What are you talking about? Why not?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        That is classified. Captain, give me the
                        plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (holds plant out of reach)
                        What do you mean, "classified"? You don't
                        keep secrets from the Captain!
          
                                                                   66.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me what's classified!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        The plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
          
          It's a stare down.
          Beat.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Auto rises back into the ceiling.
          Lowers down over the vanity console.
          High speed button pushing.
          A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears.
          Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY".
          The BNL FANFARE plays.
          Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium.
          Haggard. Nervous.
          Wears an emergency oxygen vest.
          The fanfare plays too long.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                               (to O.S.)
                        Just cut it off, will ya?!
                               (music stops; forced chuckle)
                        Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad
                        news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well...
                        failed! Wouldn't you know, rising
                        toxicity levels have made life
                        unsustainable on Earth.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Unsustainable? What?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Darn it all, we're going to have to
                        cancel Operation Recolonize.
                               (dons his life vest)
                        So just, uh...just stay the course.
                        Rather than try to fix this problem,
                        it'll just be easier if everyone remains
                        in space.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (offended)
                        Easier?
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          
                                     CEO ADVISOR (O.S.)
                        Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override
                        directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot.
                        Take control of everything! And do not
                        return to Earth!
                               (ready to run)
                        Repeat! Do not return to Earth!
                               (throws on his gas mask; to
                                camera crew)
                        Now let's get the heck out of here.
          
          The CEO races out of the room.
          The message cuts out.
          
          Auto turns to face the Captain.
          The Captain shakes his head in disgust.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Now, the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        No, wait a minute. Computer, when was
                        that message sent to the Axiom?
          
          The paused image on the holo-screen highlights.
          Data begins to calculate on the screen.
          We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS.
          It stops on "2110".

                        Message received in the year 2110.

                        That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!!
                        Auto, things have changed! We've got to
                        go back!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, orders are: "Do not return to

                                     CAPTAIN
                        But life is sustainable now! Look at this
                        plant, green and growing! It's living
                        proof he was wrong.

                        What?! It's completely relevant!
                               (points out to space)
                        Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And
                        it's in trouble! I can't just sit here
                        and...and...do nothing! That's all I've
                        done! That's all anyone on this blasted
                        ship has ever done...NOTHING!!

                        On the Axiom you will survive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Must follow my directive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        DAAAARGH!!
          
          The Captain turns away in frustration.
          His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS.
          Notices AUTO in every one of them.
          Looking over all their shoulders.
          A little closer every generation.
          The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder...
          ...and Auto is right behind him.
          The Captain looks at the plant in his lap.
          His countenance grows determined.
          He rights his hat...
          ...turns to face Auto...
          ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are
                        going home today!
          
          Auto slides into his face.
          Makes the Captain flinch.
          No more Mr. Nice Robot.
          Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
          
          GOPHER
          
          shoots out of a pneumatic tube.
          Salutes Auto.
          Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay.
          She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Gopher?
          
          Gopher activates his suspension beam.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny!
                                  (to Eve)
                           Eve, arrest him!
          
          Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher.
          The robot raises his epaulet arms.
          Don't shoot!
          She opens her chest cavity.
          Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Eve, you are to put this plant straight
                           in the Holo-detector.
          
          Gopher slowly advances towards Eve.
          But then tosses the plant across the room...
          
          ...down the TRASH CHUTE.
          
                                           CAPTAIN
                           No!
          
                                           EVE
                                  (hums)
                           [Oh no!]
          
          It's over.
          The plant is gone.
          But in that frozen moment...
          
          ON TRASH CHUTE
          
          ...THE PLANT suddenly reappears.
          Rises like a ghost, up from the chute.
          Wall-E's head follows.
          Unawares of the plant resting on his head.
          
                                           WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                           CAPTAIN & EVE
                           WALL-E!!
          
          Wall-E straddles the top of the lip chute.
          The plant drops onto his chest.
          Wall-E looks at it with surprise.
          
                                        WALL-E
                                  (beeps)
                           [Hey, the plant.]
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN & EVE
                        Wall-E! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here!]
          
          Wall-E is slow to understand.
          Finally picks up the plant.
          Anticipates to throw it, when...
          ...Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
          Eve moves to help Wall-E.
          But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam.
          
          Wall-E dodges Auto's multi-arm advances.
          Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest.
          Slams it shut.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [You can't have it!]
          
          Auto flips open one of his handles.
          Produces a TASER...
          
          ...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
          
          Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out.
          He wheezes...
          ...then drops lifelessly down the chute.
          
          Eve screams.
          Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto.
          The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed.
          She shuts down.
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE
          
          Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening.
          Drops her down the chute.
          She bangs against the sides as she tumbles.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          Gopher salutes Auto and exits.
          Auto turns to the Captain.
          He is in shock.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        All communications are terminated. You
                        are confined to quarters.
          
          The power shuts off in the room.
          Auto rises back up through the ceiling...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          
          DOWN SHOT THROUGH BRIDGE FLOOR APERTURE
          
          The Captain looks up.
          Shakes his fist in fury.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                         NO! MUTINY! MUTINY! MUTINEEEEE!!
          
          The aperture closes TO BLACK.
          
          Beat.
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          Black.
          The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes.
          Her view comes into focus.
          Scans around. Disoriented.
          
          
          INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
          
          Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH.
          Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere.
          Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES.
          
          Eve looks down.
          COMPUTER MICE crawl over her.
          One of them has crawled over her REBOOT button.
          Switched her back on.
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          A warning alarm sounds.
          Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES.
          It slides into an AIRLOCK.
          Inner shield doors lock and seal.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                         Caution: Activating airlock
                         disposal...Activating airlock disposal.
          
          The exterior hatch flies open.
          The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash.
          
          Eve begins to panic.
          Calls out again:
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          Suddenly, her area is flooded in light.
          She flinches at the sight of
          
                                                            72.
          
          
          
          TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS
          
          as they rumble up behind her.
          Headlights for eyes.
          They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E.
          "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts.
          Each grab a ton of trash at once.
          Eve is swept up with the junk.
          Compact it. Spit it out...
          
          ...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube.
          
          Her cube is picked up.
          Transported to a waiting platform.
          Stacked with other massive cubes.
          Eve discovers...
          
          ...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E!
          
          He groans.
          Not doing well.
          
          Again the alarms kick in.
          The platform slides on rails...
          ...across the safety line...
          ...into the airlock...
          ...the inner shield doors begin to close...
          
          INSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve needs to act fast.
          Her gun arm stuck inside the cube.
          Struggles to activate it...
          ...It cocks.
          BLASTS herself free.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          He's stuck deep in the cube...
          
          BACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          M-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute.
          Lands in a pile of trash.
          Covered with filth.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Primal scream.]
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Piles of trash everywhere.
          The airlock doors closing in the distance.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          ZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E.
          His screen reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT".
          
                                       M-O
                                 (beeps)
                          [I have you now!]
          
          M-O speeds towards the airlock.
          
          ON EVE
          
          Tugs on Wall-E.
          Desperate to free him.
          He's slow to pull loose...
          
          ...THE GAP in the doors narrows...
          
          ...Eve's never going to make it...
          
          ON M-O
          
          Racing towards the doors.
          He's almost at the airlock...
          The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms.
          M-O is stuck.
          
          The exterior hatch opens:
          ...Eve yanks Wall-E free...
          ...The trash flies out into space...
          ...She flies against the force...
          ...Fights to reach M-O...
          ...Grabs onto his roller...
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          The WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door.
          Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock.
          The exterior hatch closes.
          
          Eve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap.
          Safe.
          M-O still stuck in the door.
          Shaking uncontrollably with fear.
          
                                       M-O
                          Whoa.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The WALL-As light up a SMALL WORK SPACE.
          Eve props Wall-E up against some trash.
          He's barely functioning.
          Fades in and out of consciousness.
          Just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.
          
                                                       74.
          
          
          
                                     EVE
                               ("Stay awake.")
                        Wall-E...
          
          Eve gently opens his chest cavity.
          Examines the damage.
          Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD.
          Charred. Shorting out.
          Irreparable.
          She flies off into the depot.
          Searches for a new circuit board.
          
          M-O dutifully cleaning Wall-E.
          Finishes up.
          His DISPLAY POV reads: "All clean."
          M-O closes up. Satisfied.
          Wall-E feebly offers his hand in gratitude.
          
                                          WALL-E
                                 (weak)
                        Wall-E.
          
          M-O stares at the filthy hand.
          Cleans it.
          Then shakes.
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
          They sit in awkward silence for a beat.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Really?)
                        M-O?
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Got it.)
                        M-O.
          
          Eve returns with FOUND CIRCUIT BOARDS.
          Shows each one to Wall-E.
          Will any of these work?
          He shakes his head with a frail "no."
          
          Wall-E opens his compactor.
          Pulls out the plant.
          
                                      WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Di...rec...tive.
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          
          Eve holds the plant.
          Her "RETURN TO AXIOM SUPERIOR" flashes in her display.
          She considers it for a moment...
          ...then tosses the plant to the floor.
          I don't care about the plant anymore.
          She holds her hand out to him.
          
                                        EVE
                        Directive.
          
          Wall-E struggles to lift his hand to Eve's.
          He reaches out...
          
          ...and bats her hand away.
          
          Surprises Eve.
          Wall-E pushes past her.
          Crawls over to the discarded plant.
          Gives it back to Eve.
          
                                        WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Errr.....
          
          Eve can't make out what he is saying.
          Wall-E fumbles around his box.
          Pulls out...
          ...the Zippo lighter.
          Lights it.
          Eve stares at the flame.
          
                                        EVE
                        Earth?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Earth.
          
          He moves his binocular   eyes up and down.
          Like the time he fixed   his broken eye.
          You can fix me, Eve.
          With spare parts in my   truck.
          The truck that is back   on...
          
                                     EVE
                        Earth! Earth!
          
          Her eyes light up.
          She understands!
          No time to lose.
          She scoops him up...
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          
                                         WALL-E
                          M-O?
          
                                         M-O
                                   ("I'm comin'!")
                          Wall-E!
          
          M-O rushes over to Wall-E.

          Hangs onto his IGLOO LATCH with his roller.
          Eve raises her gun arm...
          ...Blasts a HOLE IN THE CEILING.
          Takes off with the two of them.
          Up through the garbage chute.
          The WALL-As wave goodbye.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
          A steward moves down the hall.
          Siren wailing.
          Scans for rogue robots.
          Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen.
          He stops in front of...
          
          A YELLOW LINE
          
          painted haphazardly on the floor.
          Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door.
          
                                         STEWARD
                          Wrong.
          
          The steward opens the closet.
          Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner.
          The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush.
          The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          
          Suddenly, everything begins to shake.
          The steward looks around, confused.
          A JET ENGINE NOISE builds.
          Seems to be coming from...
          
          ...the hallway TRASH CHUTE.
          
          Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it.
          The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E.
          Beeps the POYSC song.
          Our savior has arrived!
          The steward's alarm goes haywire.
          
          ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY
          
          He takes a snapshot:
          Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant...
          
                                                                 77.
          
          
          ...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera.
          
          ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The terrified steward is thrown in.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please hold. We are currently having
                        technical difficul -- !
          
          Eve locks the door on him.
          The trio take off down the hall.
          The freed paint-bot gives chase.
          Cheers POYSC as he follows.
          Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea.
          Presses his PLAY BUTTON.
          POYSC BLARES through the hallway.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music.
          Parade after Eve and Wall-E.
          Hum POYSC.
          All following the pied piper.
          
          ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates.
          Alarms sound.
          Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue
                        robots...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto observes the same "Wanted" image.
          
                                     AUTO
                        Not possible.
          
          Raises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM.
          It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location.
          Auto activates every steward on the Axiom.
          
          ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT
          
          Stewards eject from their wall stations.
          Like ATMs jumping to life.
          Race in the direction of Eve.
          Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way.
          
                                                                    78.

                        ...Caution: Rogue Robots...
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches the deck plan display.
          Monitors the progress of all the stewards.
          The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to...
          
          THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain, still trapped.
          Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door.
          Has no effect.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (hoarse; exhausted)
                        Mutinyyy...Mute...neee...This is your
                        last chance...Auto...You hear

                        robots...
          
          A flashing light catches his attention.
          Outside his window.
          He looks up on the SKY DOME...
          A GIANT "WANTED" IMAGE of Eve and Wall-E, holding...
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The plant!
          
          The Captain's eyes light up.
          Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor.
          "Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth"
          He is filled with renewed determination.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Laughs) We'll see who's powerless now.
          
          Lays flat in his chair.
          Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey.
          Pulls off the underside panel.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Ah-Ha!
          
          Yanks out a bundle of wiring.
          Cross-connects two wires.
          The console powers up...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNELS - NIGHT
          
          Eve zooms through the hallways.
          A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them.
          They reach an intersection when...
          
          ...The CAPTAIN'S FACE appears on holo-screens all around
          them.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
          
          ALL AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          All screens display the Captain's live feed.
          He's absolutely everywhere.
          A few stray passengers are still up.
          Watch their screens in confusion.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
          
          Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen.
          Furiously tries to shut off the intercom.
          
          BACK ON EVE AND WALL-E
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm
                        locked in my room. Eve, Wall-E, bring the
                        plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have
                        activated the holo-detector. Now hurry!
                        Auto's probably going to cut me off --
          
          The screens all go dead.
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other with determination.
          They're about to continue on when...
          
          A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
          
                                    STEWARDS
                        Halt.
          
          Dozens of them stand in a row.
          Eve fires her gun. Destroys a steward.
          Another one quickly takes its place.
          Traps her arm with its SUSPENSION BEAM.
          She can't shoot.
          The stewards advance, when suddenly...
          
          ...the Rejects charge the stewards:
          
          ...The beautician-bot deflects rays with her mirrors...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in their faces...
          
                                                                      80.
          
          
          ...The defib-bot shocks them with her paddles...
          ...The umbrella-bot opens up...
          ...Shields the others from the attack...
          
          BEHIND THE UMBRELLA-BOT
          
          A weak Wall-E activates his welding beam.
          Shorts out the Massage-bot's ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          It goes berserk.
          Leaps at the entire army of Stewards.
          Robot parts fly everywhere.
          Eve and Wall-E can't watch the carnage.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          He sets Eve's CYLINDRICAL DEVICE on the floor behind him.
          It projects her stored memories.
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen.
          A MESSAGE SCREEN pops up.
          It's the Captain.
          
          ...and he's holding the plant?
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto!
          
          Auto's single lens irises wide.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Not possible.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it?
                          Come and get it, Blinky!
          
                                      AUTO
                          No.
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen.
          It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT.
          The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E.
          Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Ha ha!
          
          HEARS AUTO coming.
          Turns off the vid-com.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall.
          The room goes dark again.
          
          CLOSE ON CEILING
          
          The aperture opens.
          Auto lowers into the dark.
          Cautiously searches the empty room...
          
                                       AUTO
                          Captain? Captain...?
          
          ON AUTO'S POV
          
          PANS across the portraits of other captains...
          ...past our present Captain...
          ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously...
          -- wait a minute.
          
          The Captain lunges at him.
          Grabs Auto by the steering wheel.
          Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale.
          His lower extremities of no use.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Let go. Let go.
          
          Auto panics.
          Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling.
          The Captain gets stuck between floors...
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          What too heavy for ya, huh?!
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          ...Auto tries to pull free.
          The Captain won't let go.
          Auto ends up yanking him through.
          The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco.
          Auto swings violently back and forth.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          You're not getting away from me, one-eye!
                          -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?!
          
          Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube.
          Sees the Captain fighting Auto.
          Charges at the Captain...
          
          ...who kicks him straight out the window...
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
          Gopher plummets...
          ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL...
          ...and smashes in a heap on the cement.
          The end.
          
          ON WALL-E AND EVE
          
          We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards.
          The massage-bot floats above it all.
          Pants like a wild beast.
          One steward still twitches.
          The massage-bot crushes him with one blow.
          
          Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant.
          They take off for the Concourse Level.
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           That's it!...A little closer!
                           Must..press...button.
          
          The Captain reaches his one free hand out for...
          ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Gotcha! Ha ha!
          
          His hand slams down hard on it.
          KLAXONS sound all over the ship.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          ...Floodlights kick on everywhere...
          ...The LIDO DECK POOLS automatically cover up...
          ...Stray PASSENGERS pause to take in the alarms...
          ...SPACE-LIFE PRESERVERS burst from their hover chairs...
          ...Inflate around their necks...
          ...GREEN LINES appear on the floors...
          ...SLEEPING PASSENGERS are involuntarily led out of their
          cabins...
          ...Every hover chair follows the illuminated lines...
          
          The procedure is completely automated.
          The passengers are all confused.
          Helpless to stop it.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers glide in by the thousands.
          Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools.
          Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          ON JOHN AND MARY
          
          They arrive together at the Lido Deck.
          Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying.
          A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them.
          
                                      NANNY-BOT
                         Remain calm. Remain calm.
          
          CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA
          
          The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates.
          A large cylindrical device rises from the stage...
          
          ...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR.
          
          JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome.
          Show the bridge.
          Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto.
          He tries to speak to them during the fight:
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                                (strained; in command)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your
                         Captain speaking! We're having a slight
                         malfunction with the Autopilot! Please
                         remain calm!
          
          The passengers get caught up in the conflict.
          Treat it as if it were a televised fight.
          
          ON THE REAR OF THE DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel.
          Make a beeline for the holo-detector.
          Ready and waiting for the plant...
          
          ...almost there...
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
                                     AUTO
                         Enough.
          
          Auto furiously spins his wheel.
          Throws the Captain to the floor.
          The entire ship lists dangerously to one side.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side.
          Wall-E drops the plant.
          It tumbles off the bridge plaza.
          Eve is forced to set Wall-E down.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
          He clings to the holo-detector.
          She flies off to retrieve the plant.
          
          The hover chairs stay locked on their lines.
          Passengers all slip off their chairs.
          Their uniform color defaults back to RED.
          Slowly slide across the deck.
          And for the first time...
          ...all of humanity reaches out to one another.
          CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands.
          
          Everyone piles up on the listing side.
          The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity.
          Eve searches desperately amongst them.
          
          ON JOHN & MARY
          
          They hang together off their chairs.
          CRYING TODDLERS just above them.
          The kiddies slip out of their hover rings.
          Mary GASPS in horror.
          Yells to John:
          
                                        MARY
                           John, get ready to have some kids!
          
          They purposefully let go of their chairs.
          Grab hands, forming a human chain.
          Catch the toddlers.
          All slide together down the Lido Deck.
          The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down.
          They land at the bottom, next to Eve.
          
          An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck...
          ...lands on the pool level.
          It begins sliding down the Lido Deck.
          Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.
          
                                           MARY
                                  (Gasp)
                           LOOK OUT!
          
          Eve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them.
          She stops   the car before it hits.
          Struggles   to hold it up.
          Can't let   it crush the passengers below her.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto keeps the ship tilted.
          Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          Switches it off.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                       85.
          
          
          
          The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor...
          Wall-E is still hanging onto it.
          Barely functioning.
          He uses all his strength...
          
          ...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector.
          
          Stops it from disappearing into the floor.
          The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes.
          Something's wrong.
          Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW.
          Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device.
          
                                    AUTO
                           No.
          
          Auto presses down on the "off" button.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him.
          Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up.
          Begins slowly to expand himself...
          
          ...and push the holo-detector back up!!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Jams it into the "off" button.
          Short circuits it.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                           NO!!
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector reverses full force.
          Crushes Wall-E.
          We can't tell if he survived the crush.
          
          Eve calls out for him.
          Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers.
          
          BACK ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed.
          That's it.
          He braces his arms against the floor...
          
                                                                 86.
          
          
          ...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET...
          
          ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN
          
          The passengers collectively GASP.
          Their Captain is standing...
          ...and walking himself up the railing...
          ...towards Auto!
          They CHEER!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto hears the distant cheering.
          Wonders what's up.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                           Auto!
          
          Auto whips around.
          Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly).
          Finds himself face to face with him.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Rushes at him.
          The Captain grabs it. They wrestle.
          The taser ARCS in the Captain's face.
          He flinches. Looks up.
          Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column...
          
          ...and smirks.
          
          The Captain looks Auto in the eye.
          Raises a finger up to the control panel...
          ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON...
          ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL".
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                                  (grits his teeth)
                           Auto, you are relieved of duty.
          
                                       AUTO
                           Noo --
          
          Auto is instantly turned off.
          The Captain smiles triumphantly.
          Grabs the wheel with both hands.
          Makes the ship level again.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers all spill across the deck.
          Shaken but OK.
          Eve sets the monorail down.
          Rockets over to the holo-detector.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          
          Wall-E is pinned under the lip of the holo-detector.
          Eve tries to lift it up.
          It won't budge.
          She looks back to the crowd.
          
                                     EVE
                        PLANT! PLANT!
          
          ON M-O
          
          He searches the crowd for the plant.
          Humans begin to stand for the first time all around him.
          Through his POV he spots the plant mixed in among them.
          "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" flashes on his display screen.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She fights to keep the machine from crushing Wall-E further.
          
                                      M-O (O.S.)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          M-O holds the plant up from across the Lido Deck.
          The vacu-bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger.
          Humans and robots form an impromptu fire line.
          Toss it up to Eve on stage.
          She shoves the plant into the device.
          The detector instantly scans the plant.

                        Earth.
          
          Slowly, the holo-detector rises...
          Wall-E topples out from underneath.
          Badly crushed and leaking oil.
          Eve GASPS in horror.
          M-O and the Rejects avert their eyes.
          Passengers recoil as well.

          It converts into a GIANT STAR CHART.
          Rapidly plots a course for Earth.

          Eve lifts Wall-E up.
          No sign of life.
          
                                      EVE
                        No! WALL-E!!
          
                                                                    88.
          
          
          
          M-O's head drops in despair.
          The passengers witness grief for the first time.
          Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy.
          Mary begins to cry.
          Buries her head in John's shoulder.
          
                                        MARY

          The ceiling countdown hits "0:00."
          
          
          EXT. AXIOM
          
          The ship jumps to light speed.
          
          BACK INSIDE
          
          The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet.
          Everyone holds on to one another.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          The Captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel.
          Fights the G-forces.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          Humans and robots hang on for dear life.
          John and Mary cling to each other and the babies.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She holds tightly to Wall-E.
          Still calling out his name.
          No response.
          
          ON SPACE
          
          The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.
          
          
          EXT. EARTH - HILLSIDE - DAY
          
          The cockroach waits obediently on the hill.
          Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay.
          His antennae twitch with boredom.
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
          A RED DOT
          
          appears on the ground.
          The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside.
          The ground begins to shake.
          Daylight dims.
          The insect looks to the sky.
          
          ON CLOUD COVER
          
          A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds.
          Blots out the sunlight.
          The Axiom's keel breaks through.
          Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
          
          The cockroach senses his master's return.
          HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him.
          He eagerly chases after them.
          
          ON AXIOM
          
          The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky.
          Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
          
          
          EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT
          
          The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth.
          Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT.
          Thousands of feet deep.
          The ship's keel descends into it.
          The earth shudders.
          Trash towers tumble in the distance.
          
          ...Then all is quiet.
          
          ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM
          
          A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship.
          MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend.
          Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
          
          The Captain walks out gingerly.
          Holding the boot w/ plant.
          The other passengers step out on their own legs.
          Wobble like toddlers.
          They squint up at the harsh sunlight.
          A commotion is heard from the back.
          Somebody trying to push through.
          
          EVE
          
          appears out of the crowd.
          Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
          
                                                                      90.
          
          
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind her.
          They rush across the gangway.
          
          The cockroach meets up with Eve.
          Climbs up onto Wall-E.
          Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding.
          Eve urgently scans the landscape.
          Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance.
          She takes to the air.
          M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Eve! Wait!]
          
          The Captain respectfully removes his hat.
          Good luck, friend.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The interior is dark and still.
          Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens.
          Eve flies inside with Wall-E.
          Sets him on the floor.
          
          She scans the rotating shelves at high speed.
          Grabs a CAR JACK.
          Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body...
          
          QUICK SHOTS
          
          ...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve...
          ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E...
          ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion...
          ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece...
          ...She opens his new solar panels...
          
          ...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun.
          
          OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY
          
          The rejects stop.
          See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode.
          Oh no.
          
          BACK IN THE TRUCK
          
          A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E.
          Eve holds her breath, watches...
          Waits...
          
          ...Beep...
          ...Beep...
          
                                                                       91.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E (O.S.)
                        (Apple "reboot" SFX)
          
          Wall-E's meter fully charges.
          His head slowly rises from his box.
          Blinks.
          The cockroach hops with joy.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          ...She holds out her hand to him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (with love)
                        Wall-E...
          
          Wall-E gives her a blank stare.
          He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck.
          She grabs him.
          Turns him back around.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (It's me!)
                        Eve!
          
          Wall-E just stares.
          Doesn't seem to know who she is.
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Here, look at these.]
          
          She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf.
          The light bulb glows in her hand.
          She gives them to Wall-E.
          No reaction.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Remember?)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
          
                                        EVE
                               (hums)
                        [I know!]
          
          She hovers over to the video player.
          Plays HELLO DOLLY.
          Looks back to see if it has any effect.
          
          Wall-E is over at the shelves.
          Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor.
          Crushes them into a cube.
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                                                 92.
          
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Runs over the cockroach on his way out.
          The insect pops back to life.
          Watches his friend in shock.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile.
          Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube.
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Still in disbelief.
          
                                    EVE
                              (somber)
                        No.
          
          Wall-E continues to stack his cubes.
          She stops him.
          Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes.
          Nobody home.
          Eve presses his "play" button.
          Nothing but STATIC.
          Eve begins to panic.
          Shakes him.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
          
          No response.
          He's gone.
          She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
          
          Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand.
          Forces his fingers to interlace with hers.
          Holds him close one last time.
          Leans her head against his.
          Hums softly.
          
                                       EVE
                        [Hums IOTAM]
          
          She touches her forehead to his.
          Goodbye Wall-E.
          A TINY SPARK between them.
          
          Eve turns to hover away.
          Jerked back.
          Her fingers caught between his.
          She checks his eyes again.
          Nothing.
          
          But then...
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          ...a tiny SERVO NOISE.
          She looks down at their hands.
          
          CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
          
          They start to move.
          Slowly close around Eve's.
          
          She looks back at his face.
          Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus.
          His brows raise...
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah?
          
                                       EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          He notices their hands entwined.
          His dream come true.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (amazed)
                         Ee-vah!!
          
          She giggles.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK
          
          The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
          
          "And that is all that love's about..."
          
          BACK OUTSIDE
          
          Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes.
          M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck.
          They begin to celebrate.
          Wall-E's alive!
          Then M-O realizes they need privacy.
          Herds the Rejects O.S.
          
                                      M-O
                         Go! Go, go go!
          
          Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch.
          Together now and ever more.
          
          "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          CLOSE UP OF THE PLANT

          Newly planted in the earth.
          Small hands water it gently.
          PULL OUT to reveal it surrounded by kids.
          The Captain instructs them.
          John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom.
          Robots and passengers stream off the ship.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        This is called "farming"! You kids are
                        going to grow all kinds of plants:
                        vegetable plants, pizza plants!
                               (laughs)
                        Ahh, it's good to be home...
          
          The CAMERA PULLS OUT from the Axiom...
          ...over the bay...
          
          "...That it only took a moment..."
          
          ...past Wall-E & Eve holding hands in his truck...

          1.
                         
          EXT. DEVON, ENGLAND. A SUMMER'S DAY, 1912.
                         
          The bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside. We fly
          low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of
          years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor,
          ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a
          typical Devonshire dale.
                         
          We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant
          mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth.
          The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with
          assurance and authority.
                         
          We pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy,
          watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.
                         
                          FARMER
           Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl.
           Easy.
                         
          The men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult
          birth.
                         
                          FARMER 2
           This is a stubborn one, huh?
                         
                          FARMER 3
           There we go. Who's a clever girl?
                         
          Moments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky
          hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a
          distinctive white cross on its forehead.
                         
          Soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is
          both awesome and comical to see the new born creature
          struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds.
          Title: WAR HORSE
                         
          EXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS.
                         
          We follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year.
          His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the
          intimacy of their relationship.
                         
          As Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in
          the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him
          at the fence and they share a moment of connection.
                         
          Spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our
          boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his
          pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert
          with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him.
           2.
                         
          His mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and
          runs over the field at her beck and call.
                         
          Albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe
          as Joey races away with his mother.
                         
          He is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat
          gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He
          runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and
          strength.
                         
          Later - the three farmers open the gate and come into the
          field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to
          the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the
          horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of
          a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is
          shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening
          the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his
          neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to
          see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and
          struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer.
          With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm
          him down.
                         
                          FARMER 2
           Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on,
           steady does it.
                         
          Unused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the
          farmers are solid and firm. They gently lead Joey and his
          mother across the field to the gate and out into the road.
                         
          The whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their
          way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of
          Market Day.
                         
          EXT. THE MARKET. THE SAME.
          The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the
          market and into an auction pen. They find themselves amongst
          a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these
          creatures and all this life he had no idea existed.
                         
          The farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the
          auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed
          against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in
          this tight space.
                         
          An AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.
                         
                          AUCTION MAN 1
           Mornin', pop. Put your mark here.
           Good luck.
           3.
                         
          EXT. JOEY'S PEN. THE SAME.
                         
          Two men approach the pen.
                         
                          AUCTION MAN 2
           Get the colt...
                         
          One man grabs Joey and pulls him out of the pen. Suddenly
          there is a look of horror on his face. His terrified mother
          realises they are being separated. Joey panics and
          desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up
          throwing the man who is leading him aside. Joey is out of
          control. The man regains control of Joey.
                         
                          AUCTION MAN 3
           Whoa! Whoa!
                         
          He pulls Joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart-
          rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against
          the fence. Joey remains disoriented in the midst of the
          market day chaos.
                         
           AUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D)
           Easy...
                         
          INT. MAIN AUCTION RING. THE SAME.
                         
          The auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes.
          There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market
          day.
                         
          We concentrate on two men - Ted Narracott (DAD), in his
          forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have
          worn him down before his time, and SI EASTON, his more solid
          friend, both working farmers. Just behind Si is his 15 year
          old son, ANDREW. Ted has a drink in his hand. They all look
          at Joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.
                          DAD
           Now that's a beauty.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Forget it, Ted. He's half
           thoroughbred and not got a day's
           work in him.
           (points to a plow horse next to
                          JOEY)
           Now, there... There's your ticket.
                         
          In contrast to Joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands
          like a rock. But Dad remains fixated on Joey.
                         
                          DAD
           But look at him, Si. Look at that creature.
           4.
                         
          Indeed, Joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging
          because of his upset.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Don't be daft. You need something
           solid to plow a field.
                         
                          DAD
           (fixed on Joey)
           Yeah, but he's something else, that one.
                         
          The AUCTIONEER announces the start of the auction...
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle
           down - horses on my right - men with money
           in their pockets on my left - it's the
           perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?
          FRED shouts his reply from the crowd.
                         
                          FRED
           YES! I's here.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill?
                         
                          DAVE
           I'm here. Yes!
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been
           coming here for 20 years - never bought so
           much as a pork scratching.
                         
          The crowd are loving all this.
          Dad notices a figure across the ring, LYONS, clearly a man of
          money. You can see something light up in Dad's eyes - a
          combination of dislike and alcohol.
                         
          Joey is led into the auction pen.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
           Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young
           horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my
           wife on our wedding day. Let's get going,
           shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature.
                         
          But no-one bids.
                         
                          DAD
           One guinea.
           5.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           One guinea, one guinea, one
           guinea...
                         
           YOUNG ANDREW EASTON
           I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister
           Narracott.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Any advance on one guinea? Any
           advance on one guinea?
                         
          Joey is still trying to get back to his mother. A voice from
          the crowd pipes up:
                         
                          LYONS
           Two guineas.
                          DAD
           Three!
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong
           animal.
                         
          Lyons whispers to his son, DAVID, 15, next to him. David eyes
          Joey skeptically.
                         
                          DAD
           Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that
           bastard see me off.
                         
                          LYONS
           Five guineas.
                         
                          DAD
           Six!
                          SI EASTON
           Oh for the love of...!
                         
          Joey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling
          him back.
                         
                          LYONS
           Seven.
                         
                          DAD
           Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.
                          (BIDDING)
           Eight.
           6.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Stop it - he's your landlord - you
           can't be picking fights with him.
                         
          Lyons looks over. There is now tension in the crowd as they
          sense a Battle Royal for the horse.
                         
                          LYONS
           Ten guineas.
                         
          He smirks at Dad.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           You haven't got the money. Let's go
           home - let's have a pint.
                         
                          DAD
           Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as
           any in this town.
                         
          They all look at Lyons in his suit and bowler hat.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?
                         
                          SI EASTON
           That's top price for a workin'
           animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!
                         
                          DAD
           There are big days and there are
           small days. Which will it be?
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas?
                         
          All eyes are on Lyons and his son - David is 15, smartly
          dressed.
                         
                          DAVID LYONS
           Just let him go, dad, I don't care
           for him, he's too... jumpy.
                         
          Lyons isn't listening to David; he's looking hard at Ted.
                         
                          LYONS
           Shall we say - twenty five?
                         
          The crowd gasps. This is clearly personal.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
           7.
                         
                          ANDREW
           You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run
           for his money.
                         
          But when he looks at Ted, Ted's eyes are locked into the eyes
          of his rival.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Going, going...
                         
                          DAD
           Thirty. Thirty guineas!
                         
          Total silence. He stares hard at Lyons. Who simply smiles,
          raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. It dawns on
          Dad that he's won the auction. He breaks into a sweat.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going
           going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott.
                         
          He bangs his gavel. It's a done deal.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           What have you done, Ted? What have you done?
                         
          Dad doesn't acknowledge Si.
                         
          Moments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back.
          Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the
          auction man in a kind of daze.
                         
          Suddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder.
                         
                          LYONS
           Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do
           with him - on a working farm? I hope you
           got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it
           when it comes due.
                         
          Dad does not acknowledge Lyons. Lyons smiles and walks away
          with son David, and his cronies. Si shakes his head at Dad.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll
           never forgive you.
                         
          EXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. SUNSET.
                         
          MRS. NARRACOTT kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots,
          when she sees Ted returning.
                         
          Dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling Joey
          with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side.
           8.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and
          then at Dad. She is a good-looking, intelligent woman, but
          clearly her life is always hard.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           What have you done?
                         
          Dad stands shamefaced as Albert - the boy we have already met
          - runs out of the house to join them.
                         
                          ALBERT
           That's Mooney's colt!
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           You were supposed to buy a plow horse.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You bought him?
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           What'd you pay for him?
                         
          Albert is totally taken by the horse.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
           How much, Ted Narracott?
                         
                          DAD
           I won't tell you a lie - though I would love
           to. Thirty guineas.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Thirty guineas!
                         
          She is stunned. She looks at Ted - and he just nods.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
           He's not worth ten! Are you out of your
           mind? What about the rent?
                         
                          DAD
           He's a strong one, Rosie. Look at
           the way he holds his head!
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           How the hell are we gonna pull anything with
           that? Ted - you have to take him back. You
           have to take him back right now now.
                         
                          ALBERT
           No.
           9.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           You have to get down on your knees and beg
           for our money back.
                         
          Joey bridles at the raised voices but Albert takes the rope
          and tries to calm him.
                         
                          ALBERT
           No. No, please don't take him back.
                         
          Suddenly we see Dad's dejection. He is a man lost.
                         
                          DAD
           We can't take him back till he's broken in.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           And how are you gonna train a horse with
           that leg?
                          ALBERT
           I'll train him.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't
           know nothing about horses.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it.
                         
                          DAD
           We have to keep him. We've no choice.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Right. Well... you've got one month to
           break him in or I'm taking him back myself.
           (She turns to the house,
           but then...)
           How did you get to thirty - what other fool
           bid you up that high?
                         
                          DAD
           It was Lyons.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott turns back towards the house, then stops,
          dazed, speaking almost to herself.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           We're gonna lose everything. After all we've
           been through - we're gonna lose it all.
                         
          She turns back to the others - the weight of the mistake
          heavy on their shoulders - but Albert quickly steps forward.
           10.
                         
                          ALBIE
           Don't worry, Mum - I'll raise him - and I'll
           raise him good.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Well, you better. Go on - get started. See
           if a child can undo what your fool of a
           father's done to this family of ours.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott storms into the house. Albert immediately
          goes to stroke Joey but the nervous horse draws back
          uncomfortably. Dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered,
          across the yard to the barn.
                         
          EXT. STABLES. LATER.
                         
          Albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches Joey in
          the field.
                          ALBERT
           Right. Let's make a start then.
                         
          As Albert approaches, Joey nervously runs in circles, then
          stops on a dime, looking at Albert suspiciously.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's
           beef and gravy to us!
                         
          Albert squats down. He shows the food. Joey catches the
          scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Come on...
                         
          This time, Albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body
          fully away from Joey, but keeping the bucket extended.
          Albert slowly backs towards Joey, speaking gently all the
          while.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           I bet you're missing your mother.
           Look at you... first time without
           your mum. First time away from home.
           But you're not alone, are you. In
           fact. Cos I'm `ere...
                         
          Feeling safer, Joey moves toward the bucket of oats and
          starts to eat.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           It's alright. It's alright.
           11.
                         
          Albert reaches out his hand and touches Joey. And with a
          slight start, the horse relaxes into Albert's hand, feeling
          safe with the boy.
                         
          Albert stares at the distinctive white cross on Joey's
          forehead. Joey calms.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey.
           That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright,
           You're mine now. You're mine.
                         
          Albert strokes Joey's forehead. Joey lifts his head and the
          two stare at each other in close proximity.
                         
          EXT. FARMYARD. NEXT DAY.
                         
          Dad, with a hangover, hobbles off to work the fields. As he
          reaches the gate, HAROLD the goose snaps at his heels. Dad
          dismisses him with a stare and heads for the stables.
                         
          EXT. THE FARMYARD, DAY.
                         
          The training episode: Albert walks Joey around the yard on
          the rope. It all seems to be going well. Mum looks on. Albert
          is clearly proud of his progress.
                         
          EXT. PADDOCK. ANOTHER DAY.
                         
          Albert's friend, Andrew Easton, sits on a rock with an apple
          in hand to watch the training.
                         
          Albert sets Joey in a spot and tells him to wait.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Whoa. I want you to stay there,
           Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy.
           That's it, you've got it.
                         
          Of course when Albert walks away, Joey follows.
                         
          A game of "Grandma's footsteps" ensues as Albert patiently
          places Joey then walks away.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Hey, look at him, Albie. He's
           playing "Grandma's Footsteps."
                         
          Albert patiently leads Joey back to his starting position.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Right, come on, Joey. Back you go.
           Come on. Back you go.
                          (MORE)
           12.
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           You're all right. That's it. Good
           boy. Right. You've gotta stay
           there, understand?
                         
          Albert walks away again.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           That's it. Good boy. You've got it.
           Good boy.
                         
          Finally Joey stays put. Andrew smiles, impressed.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Good boy. Good.
                          (TO ALBERT)
           Now call him. Whistle.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Come now, Joey. Come on.
                         
          Albert whistles like an owl. Joey stands completely still.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           You can come now, Joey.
                         
          He whistles again. Joey remains still.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Don't think he fancies your owls.
                         
          Albert walks back to Joey, frustrated.
                         
                          ALBERT
           No, I read it in a story. It's how
           the Indians used to summon their
           horses.
          He gently strokes Joey's nose.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've
           gotta come, understand?
                         
                          ANDREW
           My dad had a dog who stayed when you
           called him. He used to run up
           behind you when you weren't
           looking, and uh...
                         
                          ALBERT
           He's not a dog. He's just puzzling
           it through.
           13.
                         
          Albert runs further away than before and whistles. After a
          moment, Joey trots over to him. Andrew smiles broadly.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Brilliant. Look at you.
                         
          With the basis established, Albert begins to train Joey to
          react to the owl whistle without his prompting. It's not all
          easy going - sometimes Albert makes progress, sometimes not.
                         
          QUICK MONTAGE - Mrs. Narracott fills a bucket at the pump,
          then promptly spills it when Joey trots past her in response
          to an owl whistle. She calls off, frustrated.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Albie.
                         
          Dad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder.
          There's an owl call and Joey trots past him in the
          background. Dad sees Albert welcome Joey by the haystacks,
          stroking his nose affectionately. Dad walks on, his
          expression inscrutable.
                         
          Joey trots up a path, pursuing another owl call. After
          several more calls, he still can't spot Albert, until he
          cranes his neck up and sees Albert sitting in a nearby tree.
          Albert laughs.
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE. LATER.
                         
          Lyons is there with his son, David, and his unlikable
          cronies. He holds a meager handful of cash. Dad and Mum look
          chastened. The mood is sombre.
                         
                          LYONS
           There's only fifteen here.
                          DAD
           The rest will come.
                         
                          LYONS
           You know by rights I could take this farm
           back today, don't you? And I'm a great
           believer in my rights.
                         
                          DAD
           It will come.
                         
                          LYONS
           If you drank less beer and bought fewer
           horses you might be able to look your
           landlord in the eye, Narracott.
                         
          Lyons begins loading up his ledger into his bag.
           14.
                         
                          DAD
           I said I'll pay you. We got to plant the
           bottom field.
                         
                          LYONS
           Bottom field's rock hard. Only stones down
           there.
                         
                          DAD
           No, we're going to plow it. Just give me
           `til the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe
           you. With interest.
                         
                          LYONS
           How you going to plow it? Not with that
           fancy animal of yours?
                         
                          DAD
           He'll do it.
                         
                          LYONS
           You'll not get that one in a harness, let
           alone pulling a plow. Even drunk on a
           Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't
           wait for the money - there's a war coming.
                         
          Dad stands up from his chair, resolute.
                         
                          DAD
           I promise you that field will be plowed.
           We'll plant it with turnips. And the money
           will be yours when harvest comes.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott interjects, desperate.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Please, sir. Please.
          Lyons takes his time. He looks at them both - Ted and Rosie,
          almost beaten.
                         
                          LYONS
           Very well - if that fancy plows that field
           I'll give you till October to set things
           straight.
                         
          Lyons heads for the door, but Albert stands in his way.
                         
                          ALBERT
           What if he doesn't?
                         
                          LYONS
           I'll take the horse on the day he fails.

           And I'll take your father's farm and give it
           to working men who can hold their pints and
           hold their heads high in decent company.
                         
          Lyons tries to move past, but Albert grabs his arm.
                         
                          ALBERT
           No, please. Sir, you can't do that.
                         
                          LYONS
           Now, now, now, lad. What - are you bladdered
           as well?! Ted Narracott - I got you down in
           my book!
                         
          Albert knows he has to back down. Lyons walks past him and
          leaves with David and his cronies.
                         
          EXT. THE NARRACOTT FARM. THE SAME.
          Harold the goose attacks Lyons and his men. They quickly
          pile into his car and drive off.
                         
          Ted stands in the kitchen immobile with upset.
                         
          EXT. STABLES. MOMENTS LATER.
                         
          Dad throws open the stable door, jerks the harness from the
          wall, throws open Joey's stall and starts to lunge at the
          horse.
                         
          Albert runs in to try to stop him.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You can't harness him.
                         
                          DAD
           He's got to be collared.
          Dad starts to grapple with Joey desperately flailing in an
          attempt to get the harness onto Joey. Joey is completely
          confused and frightened.
                         
                          ALBERT
           No, you can't. Look, you're scaring him,
           Dad. You're scaring him. He...
                          (DESPERATE)
           He can't take a plow!
                         
          Joey tries to push Dad out of the way, Dad frustrated by this
          hits Joey hard with the harness.
                         
                          DAD
           He's got to plow!
           16.
                         
                          ALBERT
           He won't be able to do it - he's too young -
           he's not even been backed yet....
                         
          Joey rears up and kicks Dad. Who falls to the ground.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Ted!
                         
          Albert grabs Joey's bridle. Joey wrestles with Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's alright, boy. It's alright. It's
           alright. It's alright.
                         
          Dad is mad with anger and frustration - and in pain. He
          staggers to his feet and leaves.
          Albert calms Joey down. Mrs. Narracott returns the harness
          to its hook.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes
           on him....
                         
          But then she notices Dad has returned. He has a gun.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
           Ted. No. Ted, no!
                         
                          DAD
           He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take
           the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!
                         
                          ALBERT
           Dad?
          He grabs the rifle, but Dad shoves him away.
                         
                          DAD
           Move aside.
                         
          Dad raises the rifle, but Albert wrestles for it again.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Dad. Stop.
                         
          Furious with frustration Dad throws Albert to the ground and
          takes aim at the horse.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott quickly pulls the gun aside.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           You shoot that horse we have nothing.
           17.
                         
          Dad whips the gun back towards Joey to find Albert standing
          between them - right in front of the gun's barrel. For a
          second we think Albert will be inadvertently shot.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D)
           NO!
                         
          Dad pauses his finger just in time. Albert gently holds the
          barrel of the gun. Speaks calmly.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You were right what you said, Dad. "He'll do
           it," you told Lyons, "He'll plow that
           field." And he will! You'll see. He'll show
           you. We'll show you. We'll get it done.
                         
          Dad looks at him, frozen. Mrs. Narracott eases the gun away
          from him -
                          MUM
           Let go. Let go.
                         
          - and hands it to Albert, telling him -
                         
                          MUM (CONT'D)
           Go back to the house.
                         
          As Albert leaves, Ted takes out his flask. But Rosie takes it
          from him gently. He doesn't resist.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Here, here. Some days are best forgotten.
           Today ain't one of them. Come on.
                         
          They exit the stable together, leaving Joey in his stall.
                         
          INT./ EXT. STABLES. DAWN.
          Albert walks towards the stables - enters. And talks to Joey
          as he prepares the harness.
                         
                          ALBERT
           How are you today, Joey? I don't know much
           about life, boy, but I do know that there
           are big days and there are small days. And
           most days are small days, and, well, they
           don't matter much to anyone - but this -
           well, this is a big one. This is our big
           day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going
           to take this off -
           (he takes off his coat)
           Well, if it's tough for you - it should be
           tough for me, too...
           18.
                         
          He is left in just a loose-fitting white shirt....
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow
           and you're gonna learn. Is that
           understood? And then we can be
           together, which is how I believe
           things are meant to be.
                         
          Joey instinctively balks, but Albert is stern with him.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here
           we go.
                         
          As he approaches Joey with the harness, Harold the goose
          enters the stable to watch.
          Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his
          own neck and shoulders to demonstrate -
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See?
           See? You've just gotta put your nose
           through.
                         
          It is a moment between them. The horse looks Albert in the
          eye, then yields. Albert comforts him and show there is
          nothing to fear. Finally he gets the harness in place.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           That's it. See? You've got it.
           You've got it. Good boy. There...
                         
          Harold honks his approval.
                         
          Albert leads Joey out across the yard, through the broken
          gate.
                         
          EXT. LOWER FIELD. THE SAME.
                         
          It is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields
          towards the huge lower field. They come to a rusty, primitive
          plow left in the grass. Albert looks around the field - it is
          overgrown, it seems to go on forever - even if Joey was a
          plow horse this would be a heavy task.
                         
          Si Easton and Andrew stroll up the road to watch.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Too large, too rocky, matted with
           grass roots. Even a sturdy plow
           horse'd never manage it alone.
           19.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Yet he will, I say.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           You'd swear he'd sprout wings and
           fly if Albert had told you so.
           (smiling at his son:)
           It's a fine thing, loyal to your
           mate. Even if he is a bit barmy. A
           team of two might manage, given a
           month and good weather.
                         
          They're interrupted by the honk of a horn as Lyons and David
          pull up in a car. Lyons and David get out. Their driver
          remains inside.
                         
                          LYONS
           Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?
                          SI EASTON
           `Course he's watching.
                         
          Si nods in the direction of the house.
                         
          Albert steadies Joey and starts to tie on the heavy plow. It
          just seems too big and bulky for Joey's sleek frame. Albert
          sets Joey right and fixes the plow.
                         
          Lyons, David, Si, and Andrew walk towards Dad, who looks on
          anxiously from a nearby hedgerow. Lyons gestures at David to
          stay back and walks over to Ted alone. He stands beside him
          and begins to talk gently.
                         
                          LYONS
           Well, you've raised him up a true
           Narracott, Ted, picture of his
           father, he is: not a dollop of
           ordinary sense but that thick
           stubbornness that'll lead him to
           insist on the impossible.
                         
          Down in the field, Albert continues to prep the plow.
                         
                          LYONS (CONT'D)
           Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't
           admire you, myself among `em,
           leaving your brothers that fine farm
           and setting yourself at this stoney
           patch of unpromising ground. You've
           fettle enough for twenty men, but
           with a gimpy leg and the drinking -
           for the pain, isn't it, that you
           drink?

                          LYONS (CONT'D)
           - yeah, none of us could have
           anticipated an ending better than
           this. Makes me question the wisdom
           of the charity that urged me to rent
           you this place, not only looking at
           you, me old pal, but that pretty
           little wife of yours, thought you
           were a spark, she did.
                         
          Ted hasn't acknowledged Lyons for a second; he's never taken
          his eyes off Albert. He simply stands and walks away as
                         LYONS CONCLUDES:
                         
                          LYONS (CONT'D)
           And now your son's sinking into the
           selfsame bog that's swallowing you.
                         
          Albert has been meticulously preparing everything,
          positioning Joey, checking the tethers, digging the rusty
          plow in the earth. He takes his position behind the plow,
          throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck.
                         
                          ALBERT
           See Joey - I got the collar, too!
                         
          Albert gently snaps the reins. Joey doesn't move, confused by
          the whole affair.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Come on, boy. Walk on. That's it. Walk on!
           Walk on, Joey. Come on, boy, walk on.
                         
                          LYONS
           You'd be better off startin' at the
           top of the hill and goin' down!
           Gravity's the only friend you're
           gonna have today, young lad.
                          ALBERT
           Walk on, Joey! Walk on! Come on,
           Joey, walk on. Walk on, boy.
                         
          At the house, Mrs. Narracott opens an upstairs window to look
          on, anxiously. Ted, standing alone by the fence, only looks
          at Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Walk on. Come on, walk on.
                         
                          TED
                          (TO HIMSELF:)
           It'll take the whip to move him.
           21.
                         
          Just as Ted is saying this, Albert, as if hearing his father,
          takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip. Joey's
          ears prick up. Albert, grimly determined, snaps the whip at
          Joey. Joey panics and bolts. The plow spins to its side,
          pulls Albert off his feet. Joey drags them all the way to
          the top of the hill, right by the farmhouse.
                         
          Lyons, yelling, starts laughing and can't stop.
                         
                          LYONS
           Bravo! You've reached the top of the
           hill! Off you go again, boy! You'll
           make even better time comin' down!!
                         
          He continues past Dad, laughing.
                         
          INTERCUT - Mrs. Narracott looks on from the house. He
          glances back at her. Her face is full of angry concern for
          their son.
                         
          Townsfolk begin arriving, climbing the hill to the lower
          field.
                         
          Ted looks down, ashamed. Mrs. Narracott looks back at Albert,
          mortified, bruised, setting the plow right again.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and
          picks up her knitting.
                         
          Later - Albert has made no progress. Joey is moving, but
          only in a useless circle.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Good boy. Good lad. Good lad. Now
           walk on. Good boy.
                         
          More townsfolk clamor to the fence. Andrew calls out.
                          ANDREW
           Albie, we're all with ya!
                         
          Albert tries to encourage him forward but Joey still isn't
          pulling sufficiently. The plow skips uselessly over the
          surface stones.
                         
                          LYONS
           Look look look! The plow hasn't even cut
           yet!
                         
          As Albert struggles with the plow, he sees Dad walking up the
          hill behind the spectators. He doesn't even turn to his son.
           22.
                         
          Joey strains as Albert pushes with all his might. We sense
          the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the
          task. But Joey perseveres. The plow limps along.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Do you know - I believe we can do
           it, Joey. I knew when I first saw
           you that you'd be the best of us.
           That's why he bought you. He knows
           you've all the courage he never had.
           I knew when I first saw you that
           you'd be the one who'd save us.
                         
          The plow skips and Albert falls. Joey's legs buckle and he
          goes to his knees. Albert rushes to his side.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Whoa. Whoa.
          Lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall.
                         
                          LYONS
           You've got no chance, lad. He'll not
           turn over half an acre. Give it up
           now. You've done well. You've tried
           hard. You're more of a man than your
           father.
                         
          Albert examines the collar - he sees it is ripping into
          Joey's flesh. He grabs his shirt, tears a piece off it,
          tenderly folds it and puts it between Joey's shoulder and the
          collar.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit
           rough, isn't it?
                          LYONS
                          (A SHRUG:)
           Well, he'll destroy that horse.
                         
          The crowd's beginning to disperse. One of Lyons' cronies
          holds his umbrella as he returns to his car. He passes Ted.
                         
                          LYONS (CONT'D)
           I'll be over Thursday. Give you a
           day to close it up.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence -
          holding her knitting in the rain, ignoring the leaving
          crowds. A SYMPATHETIC NEIGHBOR hands her:
           23.
                         
                          NEIGHBOUR
           Your wool.
                          (THEN)
           I'm sorry, Rosie.
                         
          Lyons passes behind her, almost speaks, but then thinks
          better of it.
                         
          As the rain intensifies, Albert digs his toe into the wet
          soil and notices how it has softened. Suddenly something
          flashes through Albert's mind. He leaps into action, runs
          through the rain to shout at Joey.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey.
           You don't know, so I'm gonna have to
           do the knowing for you when the rest
           of our lives depend on this! So get
           set to pull - and pull straight! And
           pull hard!
                         
          He races back to the plow and sets himself.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, boy! Go!
                         
          Joey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken - the
          rain has softened the earth.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it!
           Good boy, Joey! Good boy!
                         
          Finally, the plow bites deep into the soil.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Walk on! Walk on! Walk on! Walk
           on, Joey!
                         
          At the fence, Mrs. Narracott looks on in amazement.
                         
          Albert notices a large rock in their path. Andrew sees it,
          too.
                         
                          ANDREW (CONT'D)
                          (YELLING)
           Go around it!!
                         
                          ALBERT
           Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey,
           whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll
           break the blade -
           24.
                         
          Albert hauls back on the reins, but Joey throws his flanks
          forward, straining and lurching until the plow blade splits
          the rock completely in half and now the plow moves more
          easily through the wet ground.
                         
          The ground yields. Soon Albert and Joey are making great
          progress. The wet earth slipping open beneath them.
                         
          Andrew is loving it, speaks in wonder.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Will you look at you?
                         
          Mrs. Narracott looks very happy, a smile breaking slowly
          across her face...
                         
          The crowd begins to return. Lyons notices and looks out from
          his car - sees the plow digging through the field.
          Annoyed at the progress Albert's making, he gets out of his
          car and walks over to Mrs. Narracott. With great disdain he
                         SAYS:
                         
                          LYONS
           I'd not let a child of mine slip in
           the mud alongside a plow blade. He
           could lose a foot!
                         
          Mrs. Narracott brandishes her knitting needles, backing him
          up.
                         
                          ROSIE NARRACOTT
           You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr.
           Lyons, if you carry on prating at me
           how to manage my son! Or my plow, or
           my horse, or my field, or my farm!
          Dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval.
          Lyons stares at her, gape-mouthed, as she turns her attention
          back to Albert.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Come on, Albie! Push on through!
                         
          The rain becomes torrential. Lyons turns towards the car -
          gestures, frustrated, to his driver, who runs forward with
          the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain. David remains
          on the running board, watching Albert plowing.
                         
          The plow speeds through the earth. The boy and the horse are
          working as one. It is a moment of triumph.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Get it done, Albie! Get it done!
           25.
                         
          We pull back to see they have made only the smallest dent in
          the enormous field.
                         
          As Lyons' car passes, Dad steps forward, takes in the scene,
          and almost smiles.
                         
          EXT. THE LOWER FIELD. EVENING.
                         
          The rain has abated. Albert, soaked to the skin, sits next
          to Joey. They are both covered in mud.
                         
          Andrew, followed by Si Easton, charges through the gate up to
          Albert. They are lifting Albert up between them, laughing,
          Si Easton planting a kiss on Albert's muddy cheek, Andrew
          tousling his filthy hair, when Mrs. Narracott arrives with
          Ted. She helps Si and Andrew lift Albert and slings her
          son's arm over her shoulder, glowing with pride, crying,
          overjoyed.
                          ROSIE
           Oh, my pair of fools. My mighty
           fools.
                         
          As the others help Albert up, Ted tends to Joey. He looks
          over to his son and, after a moment, removes his cap and
          slightly bows his head.
                         
          The others stagger away, supporting Albert, and Ted pats the
          horse and gently begins to unbuckle the harness.
                         
          INT. STABLES. DAY.
                         
          Albert washes Joey and tends the wounds and sores on his
          body. Rosie is putting antiseptic on Albert's wrists and
          shoulders. Joey bristles but is soothed by Albert's care.
                         
                          ROSIE
           You're as battered and bloodied as he is.
                         
                          ALBERT
           And where's Dad?
                         
                          ROSIE
           Still in the bottom field.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Stumbling about, I suppose.
                         
                          ROSIE
           It's not the drink, Albert, that
           makes him stumble -
           26.
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (ABRUPTLY)
           He drinks, mum.
                         
                          ROSIE
           Well, so might you if you'd been
           where he's been, seen what he's
           seen!
                         
                          ALBERT
           Well, he don't talk to me about it.
                         
                          ROSIE
           He don't talk about it because he
           can't. There aren't words for some
           things. Come here...
                         
          Rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner
          of the stables. She rummages until she finds a waterstained
          brown paper parcel tied with yarn. She brushes away some
          mouse turds.
                         
                          ROSIE (CONT'D)
           The mice've been at it. Sit down.
                         
          They sit together on a step. As she begins to untie the
          yarn, a change comes over her: her irritated determination
          gives way to sadness. Albert comes to her and kneels beside
          her as she gently opens the paper.
                         
          Inside there's a red and tan pennant, knotted and fringed at
          both ends.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were
           Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial
           Yeomanry.
          Then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two
          silver medals. The first, with the profile of Victoria, hangs
          from a red, blue and orange ribbon.
                         
                          ROSIE
           And that is the Queen's South Africa
           Medal. Every man who fought in the
           Boer War got one of those. But
           this...
                         
          She holds up the other medal, hanging from a red and black
          ribbon.
                         
                          ROSIE (CONT'D)
           That's the Distinguished Conduct
           Medal.
           27.
                         
          She hands Albert the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He takes
          it, astonished.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Not dad's?
                         
                          ROSIE
           Well it ain't mine, dear. He got
           that after the fighting at
           Transvaal. After he'd been hurt, and
           he'd saved some other lads, and
           well... I don't know what else, he
           won't tell me either. But the first
           day he got home he just... tossed
           them out. First day he could walk,
           he threw `em straight in the
           dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I
           said not to.
          Albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant. She
          takes the medal back, puts it in the sash, and begins to wrap
          it again.
                         
                          ROSIE (CONT'D)
           See, what you done today, you and
           Joey, you're chuffed up now, and so
           you should be, my splendid boy. It's
           good to be proud when you done
           something good. But what he done, in
           Africa, whatever it was, he takes no
           pride in it. Hard as it surely was,
           and however much pain it's cost him,
           he refuses to be proud of killing, I
           suppose.
                         
          She returns the things in the footlocker, closes it.
                          ALBERT
                          (CONFUSED:)
           I'd be proud. If I'd gone off to
           war. If I'd gone and saved my
           mates, and -
                         
                          ROSIE
           Well, whether or not you think you'd
           do the same thing as him... Think
           how brave he is for refusing to be
           proud.
                         
          She heads back to Albert, pennant in hand.
           28.
                         
                          ROSIE (CONT'D)
           Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he
           drinks to forget the mistakes that
           he's made - but he never gave up and
           he does that for us. And today, you
           showed the world it's all been worth
           it.
                         
          As she leaves, she drapes the pennant over Albert's shoulder.
                         
                          ROSIE (CONT'D)
           You keep looking after Joey and
           he'll always be looking after you.
                         
          Albert looks again at the pennant.
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (SOFTLY:)
           Sergeant, Seventh Battalion,
           Imperial Yeomanry.
           (amazed, to Joey:)
           You see this, Joey? It's been
           through an entire war.
                         
          Albert holds the pennant in wonder.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           I'm not stealing it. I'll give it
           back to him, someday.
                         
          EXT. FIELD. DAY.
                         
          Early morning. Dad hobbling across the furrows, alone,
          planting the field by hand.
                         
          EXT. NARRACOTT FARM. DEVON COUNTRY MONTAGE.
          Albert and Joey are now in a meadow. They trot past the field
          he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which
          Ted tends to.
                         
          The sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the
          field and up a small incline. As both Joey and Albert gain
          confidence they pick up speed. Albert pushes Joey on, they
          are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the
          exhilaration of it all. Joey races flat out across the
          countryside. Albert hanging on for dear life.
                         
          Albert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car. It's Lyons'
          car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively-
          tailored rural gentry.
           29.
                         
                          DAVID
           Um, I'm the only boy that drives in
           the village. No one else drives but
           me.
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Oh, yeah?
                         
                          DAVID
           That's right and this is my dad's
           car. You're lucky that you're in
           it. I'm not normally allowed to
           drive it `cause it's so -
                         
          Albert urges Joey to go faster, till they're neck and neck
          beside the car, racing it. David Lyons looks to see Albert
          and Joey running alongside his car. He feigns disinterest.
          Albert glances at David, but he's much more interested in the
          very pretty young woman seated next to David, her hands
          trying to control her hair, flying in the wind. Forgetting
          himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled. The woman
          turns to David:
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Is he a friend of yours?
                         
          She smiles at Albert, encouraging him. David Lyons, annoyed,
          pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of Joey.
                         
          But not for long. The sound of the acceleration and Albert's
          eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and
          again he moves out ahead of the car. The young woman grins
          at Albert.
                         
          Up ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's
          been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an
          obstacle. Albert encourages Joey to go faster.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Come on, boy, let's show her how to
           fly!
                         
          They head right for the wall, but at the very last moment,
          Joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending Albert
          sailing over the wall.
                         
          Back in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth,
          concerned. David says nothing, but allows himself a small
          smile.
                         
          On the other side of the wall, Albert stands a bit battered,
          but unfazed.
           30.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Well...you're clearly not gonna be a
           jumper.
                         
          Thunder starts to rumble ominously in the background.
                         
          EXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT.
                         
          Albert and Joey return, driving sheep before them. Angry
          storm clouds stretch to the horizon.
                         
          EXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT.
                         
          As Albert leads Joey to the stable, lighting blasts across an
          angry sky. The rain is falling in torrents.
                         
          INT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT.
          Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof
          gives way - water gushes in - Dad rushes to support the roof
          as the wind forces a window open.
                         
          At that moment, the door suddenly swings open with the
          violence of the storm, smashing against the wall - Dad and
          Rosie turn - and there is Harold the goose, who scuttles in
          without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo!
                         
          The thunder cracks again and...
                         
          EXT. LOWER FIELD. DAY.
                         
          Albert and Dad walk across the field. Mrs. Narracott digs
          through the mess. The entire crop is flat - ruined by the
          storms. The ground squelches beneath their feet.
          The whole field is a write off.
                         
                          ALBERT
           We can try planting something else, or we
           could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.
                         
          Dad doesn't answer. He shakes his head and limps away.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons'
           rent?
                         
          Ted doesn't turn around.
           31.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. EVENING.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott makes some coffee. Ted sits alone on a chair.
                         
           MRS. NARRACOTT
           What we gonna do?
                         
                          DAD
           I used to believe that God gave each man his
           fair portion of bad luck. I don't feel that
           any more. I've had more than my share.
                          (PAUSE)
           You'll stop loving me, Rose. And I won't
           blame you when you do.
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never
           love you less.
          Then somewhere in the distance, an unfamiliar sound...
                         
          EXT. LANE LEADING TO THE VILLAGE. EVENING.
                         
          A motorbike rumbles along the lane at huge speed creating a
          cloud of dust as it goes. The noise of the motorbike is
          drawing attention from all over the valley. It can be heard
          fields away and everyone is drawn to this completely unheard
          of sound.
                         
          EXT. THE VILLAGE. EVENING.
                         
          The motorbike whizzes through the village. Heads turn in
          astonishment.
                         
                          MOTORBIKE RIDER
           It's war!
          The bike comes to a stop in the market place. The rider takes
          off his goggles.
                         
          Men of the village start to flock around the machine, with
          great curiosity.
                         
           MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)
           We are at War with Germany. You hear?
           England is at war with Germany.
                         
          Shock and amazement. The rider takes off his goggles:
                         
           MOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D)
           They're going to ring the bells at six
           o'clock - and then never ring them again
           until the war is over.
           32.
                         
          Everyone across England knows that their lives are about to
          change.
                         
          EXT. FARM YARD. DAY.
                         
          Dawn rises over the farm.
                         
          EXT. FARM YARD. DAWN.
                         
          Albert races to the stables, excited with the campaign
          pennant.
                         
          INT. STABLES. THE SAME.
                         
          As Albert enters the stables, he calls out:
                         
                          ALBERT
           Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock
           Fair!
                         
          Albert opens the doors and stops dead. He looks at the empty
          stables.
                         
          EXT./ INT. KITCHEN / YARD. DAY.
                         
          Albert runs out.
                         
          He rushes into the kitchen. His mother stares out the window.
          She has been crying.
                         
                          ALBERT
           What has he done with him?
                         
          She says nothing, but her face gives everything away. Albert
          in a panic turns and runs out into the lane. Mrs. Narracott
          tears up again.
          EXT. SQUARE OF A MARKET TOWN. THE SAME.
                         
          The market square is full of military men. The Union Jack is
          flying up the flagpole. A group of girls has gathered to
          check out the army boys. Eager young men crowd a table
          staffed by recruiting officers:
                         
                          RECRUITING OFFICER
           Last name first. First name, middle
           name, last.
                         
          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS is in the square inspecting Joey,
          knowledgably. He is a handsome, attractive, modest, upper
          class man. Dad stands beside him. He checks Joey's teeth, his
          feet and finally, looks him straight in the eye.
           33.
                         
                          DAD
           Take my word for it - finest horse
           in the parish. Goes like a racer,
           strong, decent, very fine.
                         
          Captain Nicholls has immediately connected with Joey and puts
          him at his ease. SAM PERKINS, a tough sergeant, is physically
          inspecting Joey.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           No curbs, no splints, good feet and
           teeth. He's as sound as a bell,
           sir.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           And how much are you charging, sir - for
           this strong, decent, and very fine animal?!
                          DAD
           Forty.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'll give you twenty and not a penny more.
                         
                          DAD
           Twenty is no good to me, Captain. Thirty
           five and he's yours.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I don't even know how he rides.
                         
                          DAD
           Oh, he rides... Splendidly. You'll
           be astonished. I promise you that.
           (his heart's in his
           throat, fighting back
                          GRIEF)
           Finest horse in all of Devon. Finest
           horse I ever seen.
                         
          EXT. SQUARE OF A MARKET TOWN. THE SAME.
                         
          Albert bursts into the square just in time to see Nicholls
          and Dad shake hands. Their business concluded.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Thank you.
                         
          Albert races towards Joey. Ted grabs him. Albert fights to
          get free. He looks at his father in anger and betrayal.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained
           him!
           34.
                         
                          DAD
           Albert.
                         
          Albert is hysterical.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just
           paid thirty guineas for him.
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (TO TED:)
           Please, I'll get you money. I will,
           I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work
           for it! I'll work for it.
                          (TO NICHOLLS:)
           He won't obey anyone else. He won't
           be any good in the war, neither.
           He...he shies at every sound!
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Albert snaps to attention.
                         
                         
                          ALBERT
           Well, if Joey's going, I'm going,
           too. I'm volunteering.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I see. What's your name, lad?
                         
                          ALBERT
           Albert, sir.
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           And how old are you, Albert?
                         
                          ALBERT
           Nineteen, sir.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLS
           Is that the truth?
                         
                          ALBERT
           No sir. But, but I look nineteen and
           I'm bigger than most nineteen-year-
           olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And
           I...I'm not afraid of anything.
                         
                         NICHOLLS INTERJECTS:
           35.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I don't doubt your qualifications,
           Albert, but the law is very clear
           about the proper age for soldiering,
           and your father's done what he had
           to do. You know that. Thirty guineas
           isn't nearly enough to purchase a
           horse as fine as your Joey, I know
           that. But it's all I've got. Will
           you lease him to me, Albert, to be
           my own mount?
           (he removes his cap,
                          EARNEST)
           I promise you, man to man, that I'll
           look after him as closely as you've
           done, I'll respect him and all the
           care that you've taken with him. And
           if I can - I'll return him to your
           care.
                         
          Albert looks at him. Although Nicholls speaks with authority
          he has a kindness which Albert recognizes.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Now say goodbye.
                         
          Albert kisses Joey.
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's all right, boy...
                         
          But at that moment, Sam Perkins pulls Joey away:
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough.
           He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way.
                          (TO JOEY)
           Come on.
                         
          Nicholls walks away into the crowd. The Sergeant pulls Joey,
          but Joey does not want to be separated from Albert. His
          reaction is implacable, reminiscent to the separation from
          his mother. Perkins leads Joey away. They disappear into the
          crowd and Rosie is suddenly there. Ted senses her silent
          judgment.
                         
                          DAD
           Do you want to lose the farm, Rose?
                         
                          ROSIE
           It's the way you did it.
                         
                          DAD
           But we're at war.
           36.
                         
                          ROSIE
           Aren't we just.
                         
          She looks at Albert. Implacable. Forever.
                         
          EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE SAME.
                         
          The recruits march through town under pennants and the
          strains of a familiar song("The Jolly Plowboy") - it is a
          song they all know, which means a lot to them - full of soul -
          a song of harvest or a Celtic hymn, something relating
          specifically to the lives they have led together. Everyone of
          every age - everyone in the village knows this song - it is
          theirs.
                         
          Nicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving
          behind - cheering - a whole generation of young men is
          marching off to war. One girlfriend rushes up to kiss her
          leaving boyfriend.
                         
          Albert watches Joey, then remembers the campaign pennant
          dangling from his pocket. He runs up to Joey -
                         
                          ALBERT
           Joey...
                         
          - and tucks the pennant into Joey's halter.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           Here now, I've told you - sling your
           hook!
                         
          But Nicholls intervenes from his car.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Let him be, Perkins.
                          ALBERT
           This isn't the end. This isn't the
           end, my brother... I, Albert
           Narracott, solemnly swear we will be
           together again. Wherever you are, I
           will find you. And I will bring you
           home!
                         
          And then they are past him, leaving him behind. As Perkins
          leads Joey across a stone bridge, Albert watches from the
          bank of the stream.
                         
          Joey balks one last time -
           37.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           Whoa. Steady, steady. Steady now,
           come on. Walk on! Walk on now,
           come on!
                         
          - then Perkins leads him away, leaving Albert behind.
                         
          The very last recruits leave the village - leaving the debris
          of this army's visit strewn on the square. Like the debris
          of a party you are already beginning to regret.
                         
          INT. ARMY STABLES. THE SAME.
                         
          Joey is handed off to a groom. Joey is amazed by the scale
          of the building. Each horse has a large stall and is being
          tended to assiduously. Joey looks around at the hundreds of
          men and horses around him and panics.
                          GROOM
           Whoa whoa whoa. Easy easy...
                         
          He bucks, throwing the groom to the ground, and gallops away.
          But Perkins cuts him off, grabs his halter, and jerks him
          back to attention.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           Whoa whoa whoa, Joey! Stop muckin'
           about, you hear? Yer in the army
           now, son.
                         
          He pushes him into his stall, next to Major Stewart's horse,
          a magnificent black stallion, TOPTHORN.
                         
           SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
           Good boy, good boy. Steady
           steady... Easy. Relax. Easy easy,
           back up.
          Joey rears up in his stall.
                         
           SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
           Joey - meet Topthorn. Topthorn - this is
           Joey. Sort out who's in charge between the
           two of you, you hear? If you want to fight,
           you get it over with - `cause once we're
           over there, you're gonna need everything
           you've got for Fritz!
                         
          This is the first time that Joey has had to deal with another
          horse since his mother - the beginning of one of the most
          important relationships in his life.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.
           38.
                         
          Nicholls passes his gloves and crop to his bat boy who is
          there to assist him.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           There'll be nothing gentle about the war,
           sir. And there'll be nothing gentle about
           this one either!
                         
           SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
           I understand that, Sergeant, but I
           want him fit and shining. He's my
           horse.
                         
           SAM PERKINS (CONT'D)
           Sir.
                         
          Nicholls is joined by his friend LIEUTENANT CHARLIE WAVERLY.
          He is sweet and friendly - upper class but completely benign.
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Scares the living daylights out of me.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Who?
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Perkins. Glad he's on our side.
                         
          They're both joined by a tall, confident officer, MAJOR JAMIE
          STEWART. He sizes up Joey.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Not bad. Not bad at all. Still not
           a patch on my Topthorn.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got
           potential. He's certainly got the bit
           between his teeth.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           I actually think my Blenheim is faster than
           the pair of them.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Clear off!
                         
          He suddenly turns from the joking into the efficient senior
          officer he is.
           39.
                         
           MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
           All right, gentlemen, listen here.
           Everything tells us the same story, from
           Waterloo to Omdurman, from Pickett's Charge
           to the Battle of Mars La Tours - the first
           attack can and should be the decisive one.
           Perkins...
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           Yes, sir!
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           No excuses, no mistakes - every
           horse groomed and fit for
           presentation! I want a full practice
           charge tomorrow.
                         
                          SAM PERKINS
           Sir.
                         
          They leave.
                         
          EXT. SALISBURY PLAIN. DAY.
                         
          The whole regiment is gathered. Everybody is in their
          ceremonial uniform. It all has the feeling of the Changing of
          the Guard rather than anything related to a real battle. The
          day is hot, the plains are quiet and beautiful, the gathering
          is huge, there is a real sense of pride and anticipation.
                         
          Captain Nicholls, resplendent in full uniform rides Joey out
          over the vast expanse of the plain. Both Nicholls and Joey
          are dressed up like something from the last century, out of
          the Boer War, even the Charge of the Light Brigade. Nicholls
          is proud and confident. They gather before hundreds of men
          and horses all lined up to be inspected. Charlie joins them,
          looking pretty good on Blenheim.
          Finally, Nicholls and Charlie reach Stewart and Topthorn
          waiting in position.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Thought you two had bottled out.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           As if.
                         
          Nicholls looks at his friend tolerantly.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           All right, then, let's see what you
           two jokers are made of, shall we?
           40.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           This is what quiet confidence looks like.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
                         
          Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie prepare themselves for the
          charge. Joey and Topthorn size up to one another.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Over to you, Captain Nicholls.
                         
          Topthorn bristles at Joey. Everyone is highly charged. The
          competition between Stewart and Nicholls seems to have been
          absorbed between the horses. Topthorn and Joey square up for
          the practice charge like two athletes before a race.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Draw...swords!
                         
          Nicholls raises his sword. It glints in the summer air. It
          seems to hang there forever. Every man follows suit.
                         
          Topthorn and Joey glance at each other, ready to charge.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Give...point!
                         
          Every sword is pointed directly ahead at arm's length.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Charge!!!!
                         
          A roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of
          hooves breaks the silence. The huge line of horses start
          running straight ahead of them. Joey and Topthorn run off at
          top speed. Dust and earth rise up behind them.
          Bugles, the deafening thunder of hooves. It is exhilarating.
          We see the scale of the operation, we enjoy the speed and the
          splendor of the mass of men and horses. The soldiers shout in
          glee and excitement. Each man pushes his horse to out-run
          those around him, Nicholls and Stewart seem locked in mortal
          combat.
                         
          Nicholls smiles at Stewart, confidently.
                         
          Topthorn starts to pull away, ahead of all the other horses
          in the line. Nicholls pushes Joey on. Topthorn seems too
          strong, Joey will never catch them. Nicholls is determined
          not to be beaten.
           41.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Come on, Joey. I know you've got
           it. Come on, boy! Come on!
                         
          He pushes Joey on. Joey digs in and finds hidden strength and
          speed. He starts to catch up with Topthorn and draws along
          side. Nicholls and Stewart exchange tense looks.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Come on, boy!
                         
          Stewart is amazed and pushes Topthorn harder.
                         
          Now both riders are going at their top speed. They are neck
          and neck - they fight for every inch of advantage, every
          fibre of their being invested in the race. Nicholls pushes
          Joey on and Joey pulls away. Joey inches forward till he is
          almost a length ahead of Topthorn. The effort is enormous.
          Nicholls looks back at Stewart, very happy. Stewart's
          frustration shows. He knows he is beaten.
                         
          Then suddenly they race over the line. Nicholls spears a ring
          decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls Joey to a halt. They
          have crossed the enemy line. Nicholls is ecstatic. Topthorn
          comes to Joey's side.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Whoa. Whoa.
                         
          Nicholls laughs, grinning.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Nice of you to turn up.
                         
          The horses are nose to nose, snorting, we sense the heat, the
          exertion. Topthorn and Joey are brought together by the
          effort. We sense Topthorn's newly minted respect for Joey.
          And Joey is no soft touch - he slightly holds his head up in
          victory, letting Topthorn know that he knows he won.
                         
          The other horses come charging in. There is a real sense of
          achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           He's got speed...I'll give him that. But
           has he got stamina?
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           He has everything.
                         
          The two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration
          of it all. The two horses, face to face rub against each
          other for the first time. A bond has been formed...
           42.
                         
          INT. OFFICERS' STUDY. DAY.
                         
          Stewart enters. A phonograph plays "Roses of Picardy." The
          walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a
          large map of Western Europe that depicts how the English
          troops are crossing the channel to confront the Germans near
          Belgium. Nicholls is writing a letter - though actually at
          this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of Joey to
          enclose with it.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           What are you up to?
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'm writing a letter.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           With a picture in it?
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           It's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to
           show him how wonderful he's looking.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Before we take him away across the Channel
           to face a million Germans guns.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Yes. Before that...
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the
           Dragoon Guards and the Royals. Transport
           detachment - they'll need to be at the docks
           at 5 am. Check all kit. Battle orders: no
           polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup
           irons - let `em all go dull. I want nothing
           to flash in the sun and give us away.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Of course.
                         
          As Stewart leaves, he passes Charlie. He casually
          acknowledges him.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Charlie...
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Jamie.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Charlie.
           43.
                         
          Charlie checks his new cap in the mirror.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           What do you think of the cap?
                         
          He shows the bright red lining to Nicholls.
                         
           CHARLIE WAVERLY (CONT'D)
           Silk lining. I quite like it.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of
           difference to the Germans.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Oh, I don't know about that. Think about it -
           you're a Boche, just working out which of
           two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "Good
           Lord - one of them really is wearing a very
           stylish cap indeed!" You might shoot the
           other one instead.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Or, alternatively, think - "I fancy that
           cap" and kill you first of all.
                         
          Pause. Charlie removes the cap.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Hadn't thought of that.
                         
          Nicholls returns to his sketch.
                         
          EXT. DIRT ROAD. FRANCE.
                         
          Three hundred horses and their charges in a slow march in the
          middle of the most pristine French countryside.
          TITLE: FRANCE - 1914, QUIÉVRECHAIN
                         
          EXT. ROAD. DAY.
                         
          Nicholls and Stewart and Charlie ride on a smooth road past a
          series of posts screened with cloth. They're silhouetted
          against the setting sun.
                         
          EXT. ROAD. DAY.
                         
          The regiment are tense and nervous as they gingerly make
          their way along the country road. Topthorn and Joey sense
          the grim change of atmosphere.
           44.
                         
          EXT. WOODLAND ABOVE A PLAIN. DAY.
                         
          They are in woodland above a plain stretching for miles. A
          small table has been taken out for Stewart and his officers.
          SERGEANT MAJOR SINGH - a turbaned Indian with a magnificent
          moustache dressed in ceremonial garb - explains the lines of
          battle on a map.
                         
           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           That is our target - the German 11th
           Division - at the moment bivouacked three
           miles to the east of the Menin Road. We have
           been watching them and they have pitched
           tents for the night and lit cooking fires.
           Knock them out - and we could slide in
           behind the German lines and come at them
           from the South at Geluveld.
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Excellent.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Numbers?
                         
           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           About six hundred. Infantry.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Twice our size...
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           In regiments of horse and men, the
           advantage is ours.
                         
           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           And we have surprise on our side.
           But the sooner we move, the better -
           we have no assurance they'll still
           be there tomorrow morning.
                         
          Our officers just have a second to take in the news. The day
          has suddenly arrived. The day they have worked for, for so
          long.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Right. Good. So - today it is.
           Charlie - tell the men.
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Salisbury formation?
           45.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Salisbury formation. We'll charge
           through them and secure the ground
           behind.
                         
           SGT. MAJOR SINGH
           The grass to the left is taller than
           we are - it's perfect cover.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Excellent work, Sergeant Major.
           Time spent on reconnaissance is
           rarely wasted.
                         
          As Stewart departs:
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Thank you, Singh.
                          (CALLING AFTER)
           Jamie!
                         
          Nicholls catches up to Stewart, concerned.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           They have no idea we're coming.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Not having scruples, are you, Jim?
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           No. I understand the surprise is
           everything. But if it must be done,
           let's do it quickly.
                         
          Nicholls notices Charlie nervously attending his horse.
                         
           CAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D)
           Are you alright, Charlie?
                         
                          CHARLIE WAVERLY
           Never been better. Literally, never
           better.
                         
          We worry for him - he is afraid.
                         
          Stewart rides through the lines astride Topthorn.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Prepare to mount! Mount!
                         
          As the cry is echoed throughout the regiment, Nicholls
          accepts Joey from an attending soldier.
           46.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Thank you, Standley.
                          (TO JOEY)
           Hey, Joey. My bonny boy. You're
           all right, aren't you, Joey? Hey?
                         
          Nicholls takes the red campaign pennant from his pocket and
          threads it through Joey's reins.
                         
          Minutes later - Stewart addresses the men.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Gentleman. It is an honour to ride
           beside you. Make the Kaiser rue the
           day he dared to cross swords with
           us. Let every man make himself, his
           King, his country, and his fallen
           comrades proud! Be brave. Fear
           God. Honor the King!
                         
                          TROOPERS
           (in unison shout)
           Fear God. Honor the King!
                         
                         
          EXT. OVER GROWN CORN FIELD. DAY.
                         
          Cut to an elegant field of tall grass, waving in the gentle
          breeze. Then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of
          it. They are in fact our soldiers, mounting their horses -
          but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass.
                         
          Stewart gives a signal. We see the intense anticipation on
          his face. He takes out his sabre.
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Draw swords!
          The men draw their sabres in silence. The birds chirping,
          oblivious.
                         
          Then Nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost
          whispers...
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           Good luck, my friends.
                         
          He pats Joey's side. And then...
                         
                          MAJOR STEWART
           Forward, to walk! Walk...march!
                         
          The regiment begins moving through the field.
           47.
                         
           MAJOR STEWART (CONT'D)
           Forward to canter! Canter...march!
                         
          The men start to float over the grass - swept along by their
          invisible horses, until...
                         
          Suddenly they emerge from the tall grass - the immense power
          of the galloping horses - silence explodes into a violent
          crashing of hooves. The noise is immense, swords are flying
          in the air. Hundreds of horses racing towards the German
          encampment.
                         
          On the German side, TWO SOLDIERS wake to the sound of
          hoofbeats. They pull their tent flap aside to find the
          invincible charge coming towards them. The Germans are
          totally unprepared. We see them scramble back towards tents,
          rush towards their guns - one man pulling up his trousers
          rushes for cover. One German drops some dirty dishes into a
          wash pot, screaming:
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Kavallerie!
                         
          Topthorn and Joey race each other like a rerun of their
          practice on Salisbury Plain. The swords and uniforms glint in
          the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in
          panic, others prepare to stand their ground.
                         
                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS
           CHARGE!
                         
          The British head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries
          with sheer exhilaration.
                         
          We see the horses at close quarters running with all their
          might. Nicholls and Stewart yell as they approach the enemy.
          The surprise attack is a huge success. The first row of
          unprepared Germans are falling...
                         
          The regiment sweeps through the encampment, cutting down
          soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the
          tree line.
                         
          But then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the
                         CAMP --
                         
          A machine gun. No, a line of machine guns - at least twenty
          guns, sandbagged apart - the logical, new, modern defence of
          a garrison. In an instant, the fleeing Germans have manned
          the guns. All now firing.
           48.
                         
          The noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else.
          A score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground, it
          happens almost so quickly Joey and Topthorn don't realize
          anything's wrong and find themselves racing straight towards
          the guns. The bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the
          regiment are on the ground.
                         
          Horse after horse races past the guns into the woods...all of
          them now riderless.
                         
          Nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings
          towards him. His face goes slack as he realizes he is about
          to die.
                         
          A moment later, Joey runs on - we pan up to see he is running
          on riderless - he has not realized that Nicholls is gone. The
          bullets whizz around his head, but he still runs directly
          ahead. We would always know him by the red pennant Nicholls
          tied on his saddle.
                         
          Joey is now running through the German lines. No one bothers
          to attack him as the German's concentrate their efforts on
          the cavalry behind him. The line of machine guns fire as one,
          decimating the horses and their riders.
                         
          Joey leaps and dances nimbly through the German ranks, but
          suddenly rears up in the confusion, surrounded by Germans.
                         
          Near him, surviving English officers are hauled from their
          horses.
                         
          Stewart wheels back around on Topthorn, sabre in hand. But
          he, too, is quickly surrounded by several Germans with their
          rifles trained on him. A furious GERMAN OFFICER storms over,
          speaks perfect English:
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
                          (OUTRAGED)
           What? Did you think that a garrison
           on open ground would go undefended?
           Look at yourself! Who do you think
           you are?!!
                         
          Stewart looks at the Officer - at the guns that surround him -
          and throws down his sabre, stabbing it into the ground. The
          Germans take Stewart from Topthorn.
                         
          Around them, the fields are littered with dead soldiers and
          horses.
           49.
                         
          EXT. BATTLEFIELD. DAY.
                         
          Topthorn appears disoriented and frightened. Suddenly, he
          rears up and bolts from his new German handler, galloping
          over to Joey. The horses briefly nuzzle, but both rear up
          again as they are separated and led past a young German
          soldier, GUNTHER.
                         
          He zeroes in on them, the finest horses.
                         
          A slightly more JUNIOR OFFICER approaches the outraged senior
          officer.
                         
           JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER.
           What do we do with the horses?
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           If they're injured, shoot them.
           JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER
           And the others, sir?
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           The others you round up and take to
           base camp - they will pull guns.
                         
                          THIRD OFFICER
           You'll never get fancy horses like
           these to pull guns.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           Then shoot them also.
                         
          Gunther, the young private, now standing behind them,
          interjects.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Sir - perhaps we could use some of
           them with the ambulances - to get
           the injured men off the field.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           Will they take the harness?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           I'd like to try, sir.
                         
          The officers move away - that's enough talk about horses...
                         
          CUT ON - Gunther is now with Joey and Topthorn. Near a wooden
          ambulance - which is like a giant wagon to carry humans. He
          is with MICHAEL, a very young soldier, his brother - possibly
          as young as 14.
           50.
                         
          Gunther lifts a heavy pulling harness - and tries to get
          Topthorn into it.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           It won't work - they're cavalry
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Let's try.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           You won't get the harness on.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Come on, Michael.
                         
          Topthorn balks violently.
                         
                          GUNTHER (CONT'D)
           Whoa, whoa. Easy, now, easy now,
           Englishman... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
           Easy now, easy.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Gunther! It's hopeless - we can't
           help them.
                         
          And suddenly Joey moves up and presents himself, with his
          strange self assurance and self sacrifice. And instinct for
          survival.
                         
          He sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which
          helps to calm Topthorn enough that Gunther can slip the
          collar onto the big black horse. Gunther turns to Joey,
          impressed.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Well, well, look at you. Whoever
           taught you this has just saved your
           life.
                         
          Gunther spots the red ribbon in Joey's saddle, removes it,
          folds it, and places it in his pocket.
                         
          Later - Gunther and Michael are returning from the
          battlefield with Topthorn and Joey, pulling an ambulance with
          British and German wounded. Amongst the wounded, we see a
          hand gripping a battered, silk lined hat. It is Waverly,
          wounded but alive.
                         
          EXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. DEVON. DAY.
                         
          Si Easton lets himself in through the gate. Ted pulls up
          turnips from their three acre crop.
           51.
                         
          Rosie, just across a furrow, is also engaged in the harvest.
          It's hard work. Si holds a parcel.
                         
                          SI EASTON
           Hello the farm!
                         
                          ROSIE
           (looking up, wiping her
                          BROW)
           Hello, Si Easton!
                         
          Albert passes carrying a crate laden with turnips, but pulls
          up short when he hears:
                         
                          SI EASTON
           I was at the post office and while I
           was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel
           had come for Albert, from the, from
           the, from over there - and I thought
           I could go up that way in the
           morning. And - here it is.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Well, who'd be sending me a parcel
           over there?
                         
                          DAD
           Well, open it and see.
                         
          Albert opens the parcel and pulls out a leather sketchbook...
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's a sketchbook...
           (gasp of realization)
           That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!
           See that? That's a picture of Joey!
                          ROSIE
           It's a picture of Joey. Well, I
           never!
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (EXCITED)
           And there's a letter...
                         
                          ROSIE
           Well, go on then, go on.
                         
                          ALBERT
           All right.
                          (READING)
           "Dear Albert Narracott.
                          (MORE)
           52.
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Captain Nicholls, who died...Captain
           Nicholls, who died in action today
           left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam
           Perkins.
                         
          Si Easton drops his head guiltily. Rosie catches this.
                         
                          ROSIE
           You weren't to know it was bad news.
                         
                          ALBERT
           He was riding Joey when he died.
                         
                          ROSIE
           You don't know that he was riding
           him...
                         
                          ALBERT
           "In action," it says.
                         
          Everybody falls silent. Albert goes to the fence and looks
          down at the sketches of Joey. Rosie looks at her son, her
          heart breaking for him. Dad returns to the harvest without a
          word. Albert looks off to the horizon and - over there.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN BASE CAMP. EVENING.
                         
          CLOSE -- A step stool.
                         
          Michael mounts the stool next to Joey and Topthorn, removes
          their harnesses and carries them across the road.
                         
          Michael slips and falls into the mud. Gunther dashes over
          and pulls him up just before a military convoy pulls into the
          camp, running over the tack.
                         
          The BASE CAMP OFFICER appears on a motorbike.
           BASE CAMP OFFICER.
           Gentlemen! We move forward to the
           frontline tonight. Full marching
           orders. Get moving!
                         
          As the soldiers hop to their orders, the officer turns to -
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Schroeder! Schroeder!
                         
          Both Michael and Gunther turn to him. But it's Gunther the
          Officer wants to talk to.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)
           No, not you - you. Come.
           53.
                         
          Gunther picks up the dropped harnesses as he approaches.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D)
           I'm keeping you here. You are best
           with the horses and we need to move
           the camp quickly if the enemy
           continue to push through from the
           west.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           They're pushing through?
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           I'm told. We will move later when we
           find where the horses are needed
           most.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep my
           brother here with me, he's also very
           good with horses.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Oh no no. Not necessary.
                          (TO MICHAEL)
           Get moving. We leave tonight.
                         
          He walks away. Gunther is stricken by the news, but Michael
          is excited. As he leads Joey past his brother:
                         
                          MICHAEL
           It's all right, Gunther.
                         
          Gunther can't really speak. Michael is just a boy.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN CAMP / VARIOUS. EVENING.
          Soldiers are lifting up their equipment - gathering - moving
          in the same direction.
                         
          In a quiet tent, a few last soldiers are packing. And there
          are Gunther and Michael, packing together.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           You are not going. I'll tell them
           you are only fourteen, that you're a
           boy.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Father signed me in. He knew my age
           -and so do they.
           54.
                         
          The process of packing is their way of coping with the shock.
          Gunther is folding one of Michael's shirts. Michael takes it
          back...
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Mother obviously never taught you
           how to fold a shirt.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Of course she did. I just wasn't
           listening. But you need to listen
           now! I promised her, I made her a
           solemn promise, that you would be
           safe with me. With me, Michael!!
                         
          He leans close to Michael, talking in almost a whisper.
                         
                          GUNTHER (CONT'D)
           They'll never make a head count.
           There are too many of us. You can
           stay here - slip underneath the bed -
           until they move out.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Then what?
                         
          Michael carries on with his packing.
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Gunther, it will be fine. And when
           all the machines break down and they
           call up the horses, I'll see you at
           the front. We'll be together again.
                         
          And now the case is packed. Gunther heads to the tent
          opening.
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Gunther...
                         
          Looking round, the tent is now empty. The moment to leave has
          come. Gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and
          follows Michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are
          lining up in the road.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           I'm giving this to you. For luck.
                         
          Gunther ties the pennant to the back of Michael's pack as he
          forms up.
                         
                          GUNTHER (CONT'D)
           To keep you safe.
           55.
                         
          Michael smiles at him and begins to march. Marching towards
          Ypres, on the Western Front.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Im schnellschritt! Marsch...links!
           Zwei, drei, vier!
                         
          We settle on young Michael - in line - he passes Gunther. He
          remains eager. But it is goodbye. These soldiers moving into
          the darkness and towards death. Gunther looks on - tears in
          his eyes. The two horses are uneasy - sensing tension.
                         
          A few minutes later - Gunther grabs a saddle and throws it
          onto Joey's back.
                         
          Back to the soldiers.
                         
          Suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses. They whip
          past the back of the line of marching soldiers. It's clear
          what is happening - Gunther is on Topthorn - and has hold of
          Joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him.
                         
          Gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he
          is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the
          wind, tied onto Michael's pack. Gunther speeds toward him.
          This was his plan all along. And in an instant he is beside
          him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his
          arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and
          dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's
          pounding hooves.
                         
          Michael looks at the soldiers beside him - he looks at the
          skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he
          feels his brother's arm - pulling him upwards. And now, the
          two of them are fully on Topthorn.
                         
          They leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers
          try to restore order.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           Get back in line! Line!
                         
          EXT. WOODS. LATER.
                         
          Michael now rides Joey, following Gunther on Topthorn. The
          brothers look at each other - can't believe what they have
          done - Michael is following his brother, swept along, doesn't
          know if it is right.
                         
          And Michael and Joey and Gunther and Topthorn charge on to
          freedom.
                         
          They spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some
          drying clothes.
           56.
                         
          As they ride, they grab civilian shirts and jackets and
          trousers, the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the
          ground.
                         
          And on they ride - though all too soon day starts to break in
          the far distance. They see a very dilapidated windmill. They
          aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the
          horizon.
                         
          INT. / EXT. WINDMILL. DAWN.
                         
          They reach the windmill. It feels very unused. The machinery
          of the windmill creaks in the dawn. The brothers untether the
          horses, careful now that it is light outside.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
                          GUNTHER
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Michael fingers the pennant on Joey's reins. Then...
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Will Father be ashamed?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           He will pretend to be. Maybe at
           first he will be. But in the end, he
           will be glad.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           And us? What about us?
                         
          Gunther looks at him - but doesn't reply. As Michael removes
                         JOEY'S SADDLE:
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           I was ready to go. I was proud to
           go.
           (after a beat, in a very
                          SMALL VOICE)
           I wanted to go.
                         
          Later - They sit in silence, waiting for sleep.
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           The food in Italy is good.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Yes.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           What about the women?
           57.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Not as good as the food.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Because...they've eaten too much of
           the food?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           You are too young for war. And
           you're too young for women!
                         
          Gunther laughingly pushes him over.
                         
                          MICHAEL
           I don't feel so young. Not anymore.
                         
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           Michael.
                          MICHAEL (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Go to sleep - we have a big night of
           riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael.
                         
          He jokingly strokes Michael's cheek. Michael swats him away,
          but as he settles in the hay:
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Night night, Gunther.
                         
          EXT. WINDMILL. DUSK.
                         
          Gunther and Michael sleep. Suddenly something awakens Joey.
          He stirs and then rises. Hear the sound of engines and see
          lights through the slats sweeping across Joey's face.
          Michael and Gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a
          car and several motorcycles approaching. Head-lamps filter
          through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the
          brothers awake.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Hei! In die windmühle!
                         
          The boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Go, go, go...
                         
                          MICHAEL
           Okay.
           58.
                         
          They race up a nearby ladder, but Michael stumbles against a
          table, upsetting some gear. It clatters loudly. They cower
          as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside. Then the
          windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright
          headlights of the vehicles.
                         
          As they're marched out, we see what they see: A German car -
          two motorcycles. Six Germans, including the officer who was
          in charge of them.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Schroeder.
                         
                          GUNTHER
           Yes, sir.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           A mistake?
          He's offering an excuse, but -
                         
                          GUNTHER
           A promise.
                         
          The officer accepts this grimly, nods.
                         
           BASE CAMP OFFICER
           Ja...
                         
          As the boys are taken away, he lights a cigarette.
                         
          INT. WINDMILL. NIGHT.
                         
          Through the turning arms of the windmill, we glimpse the
          double execution. Four rifles fire - flashes of the soldiers
          shooting - the bodies on the ground.
          EXT. OUTSIDE THE WINDMILL. DAY.
                         
          Complete stillness in the empty countryside.
                         
          INT. THE WINDMILL. DAY.
                         
          There are Joey and Topthorn, still waiting.
                         
          And then suddenly - the doors of the windmill creak. The two
          horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence. The
          door opens a little - and we see, reflected in Joey's eye, a
          very delicate, beautiful, thirteen-year-old country girl
          (EMILIE).
                         
          She stares at the horses. They stare straight back at her.
          And she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind
          her. Joey and Topthorn settle for a moment.
           59.
                         
          Time transition - Joey and Topthorn are in a slightly
          different place - and the door opens again. It is the same
          little girl - but this time she comes in carrying two buckets
          full of water.
                         
          INT. / EXT. FARMHOUSE / FARM. DAY.
                         
          A small humble farmhouse - and round it, small fields,
          planted with different fruit crops. We see an old man
          (GRANDFATHER), burdened with a basket of berries heading back
          towards the farmhouse.
                         
          A SOUND CAUSES HIM TO LOOK OUT ACROSS THE FARM -- far in the
          distance the STORM OF WAR is in the sky.
                         
          He enters the kitchen - which is rough, but full of the
          paraphernalia of jam-making - jars, sieves, pectin, sugar.
          Emilie is at the sink, washing berries.
                         
                          EMILIE
           Grandpére.
                         
          He heads towards the side-board, dumps the two bags and lifts
          the first handful of fruits on to the counter.
                         
          She empties her clean berries into a bowl. Notes the
          explosions outside.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           It's closer today.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           The wind plays tricks with the noise
           - it's moving away from us.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I can hear it, Grandpére, and there
           is no wind. You shouldn't lie to me.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Here. There is no wind here. But
           over there - a wind so strong it
           will lift you off the ground...
                         
                          EMILIE
           You lie about everything. You say
           you aren't worried but it's clear
           you are. I know the war is
           approaching but you say, "Oh, it's
           just a trick of the wind."
                         
          He retrieves a bottle of medicine from the mantle.
           60.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
                          (SMILING)
           Did I say that?
                         
                          EMILIE
           You started lying when Mama and Papa
           went away.
                         
          She pours a load of sugar into a bowl with the fruit.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           They're dead. But you won't say so.
           Do you think I'll die if you tell me
           the truth?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           The truth is -
          He feeds her a spoonful of the medicine.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           - you should speak to your elders
           with respect.
                         
          She sticks her wet finger in the sugar and sucks it to help
          with the taste of the medicine.
                         
                          EMILIE
           If you tell me the truth about the
           war, I will tell you the truth about
           the big horses I've been keeping in
           the windmill.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           (standing, putting his
           hands on his hips)
           Now - who is the one telling lies!
          EXT. COURTYARD. SAME.
                         
          Grandfather looks stunned as he paces in front of JOEY AND
          TOPTHORN - who stand in the small courtyard outside the
          house.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           In the windmill?
                         
                          EMILIE
           Yes. They were standing in the
           windmill waiting for Don Quixote.
           This is François (Joey) and this is
           Claude (Topthorn).
           61.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yeah.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I named them after two boys who
           broke my heart last Summer.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           They must belong to someone. Horses
           like this don't just appear from a
           fairy-tale.
                         
                          EMILIE
           Yes - I know, Grandpére. They are
           not unicorns - so I will be fair and
           wait -- one day.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Emilie... Emilie...
                         
                          EMILIE
           And if no one comes to get them by
           night-time, then they belong to me.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Emilie. Look at me. You cannot
           ride.
                         
                          EMILIE
           Mother used to tell me how my bones
           would give way with the slightest
           bump or fall.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yes. That's right. So it is
           settled?
          She kisses his cheek --
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           Good girl.
                         
          -- but then calmly leads the horses back to the windmill.
                         
                          EMILIE
           It will only be settled when I
           decide which one to ride first.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           But it's - Over my dead body!
                         
                          EMILIE
           At least I won't have long to wait.
           62.
                         
          That is the end of the conversation as far as she is
          concerned.
                         
          EXT. FARM HOUSE. DAY.
                         
          Emilie is with the horses in the little stable at the end of
          the courtyard - a bit away from the farm house - she is
          feeding them out of a bucket - not very nice gruel.... WE
          SEE THAT SHE IS HESITANT WITH THEM - that she has spent no
          time around horses.
                         
                          EMILIE
                          (TO JOEY)
           I was in love with a boy called
           François - who had your lovely eyes.
                          (TO CLAUDE)
           Unfortunately he was in love with a
           girl called Marie, who had your
           teeth. She fell for a boy called
           Claude - who broke my heart. And who
           I intend to marry one day.
                         
          INT./EXT. FIELD IN FRONT OF FARMHOUSE. DAY.
                         
          Grandfather watches Emilie from inside the house as he makes
          jam.
                         
           EMILIE (O.S.)
           Eyes on me. No talking.
                         
          Outside, Emilie has fashioned two jumps. The big one for Joey
          and a little demonstration obstacle for herself. She leads
          Joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some
          crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground.
          The red pennant hangs from the stick. Joey stands quietly as
          Emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with
          her hand.
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           Today we learn to jump. Did you know
           the French cleared one meter eighty-
           five at the Paris Olympics to win
           the gold medal? Today we will beat
           that record.
                         
          Grandfather chuckles. Emilie indicates the larger barrier.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           This is your jump. When I call
           you....be very brave and leap over
           it.
                         
          She claps, but Joey doesn't move.
           63.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           Leap over it! Watch me.
                         
          She turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her
          six-inch high barrier.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           And now it's your --
                         
          She turns to find Joey already stepping over her mini-jump,
          stopping in front of her. He's only interested in the apple
          in her hand. She takes a bite herself.
                         
                          JUMP TO:
                         
          Emilie returns Joey to the starting line and runs back behind
          the big jump. From behind her back she produces three big
          carrots dripping soil. Joey's ears perk and he takes off
          quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between
          the two jumps.
                         
          INT. FARMHOUSE. DAY.
                         
          Grandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his
          strawberry jams. He laughs and goes back to work.
                         
          BACK TO FIELD
                         
          Aware she's being watched, she slings the carrots over her
          shoulder, frustrated.
                         
                          JUMP TO:
                         
          EXT. BARN. LATER.
                         
          Joey slowly emerges from the barn with Emilie out in front
          leading him with one hand. In the other hand, she carries a
          small wooden step ladder.
                         
                          EMILIE
           He doesn't think we can do it. But
           we will show him, won't we?
                         
          Emilie unfolds the ladder beside Joey and shakily starts
          climbing to the top of it.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           (Her voice shaking)
           No need to be afraid.
           (Emilie looking down at
           how far off the ground
                          SHE IS)
           You are...very tall.
           64.
                         
          Before she can swing her leg over Joey's back -
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           You'll kill yourself.
                         
          Emilie turns, and there, blocking the hurdle, now standing
          hands on hips, is Grandfather.
                         
                          EMILIE
           Only if you get in my way to make me
           fall.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Oh please, come off the ladd--
                         
          A SOUND from far down the road. Grandfather looks. Emilie
          turns to look too. Two trucks led by a German motorcycle are
          approaching the farm.
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           Find somewhere to hide them. And do
           it quickly!!!
                         
          As Emilie races off with the horses, Grandfather pushes over
          the jumps and jams the pennant into his pocket.
                         
          The bikes arrive first, just missing Emilie as she leads the
          horses behind the house.
                         
          The trucks arrive, pull round - one of the soldiers in the
          front jumps out and opens the back.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           Halt! Und aussteigen!
                         
          The people - 20 of them, all seeming to be poor French
          peasants, mainly women, move out of the truck. As they walk
          past, they avoid the eye of the Grandfather, who approaches
          the soldiers.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           My name is Bonnard - this is my
           land. Why are you here?
                         
                          SOLDIERS
           Food for the soldiers at the front.
           Everyone must give their share.
                         
          And suddenly we see what is going to happen - the 20 peasants
          spread out and move through the field - with either bags, or
          using the aprons they wear - picking all the fruits - at just
          the moment all the work has brought forth fruit - and the new
          year's crop is ready.
           65.
                         
          Raspberries, black-currants, gooseberries. In a few minutes,
          everything he lives by will be gone.
                         
          Watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is BRANDT,
          the officer in charge of the unit.
                         
          Cut to the fields - the aprons and baskets are getting full.
          They move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts.
                         
          Back to the Grandfather - and out of the house comes Emilie.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           They are taking everything. Where
           are the horses?
                         
          Pause.
                         
                          EMILIE
           What horses?
                         
          The sound of jars breaking draws Grandfather and Emilie into
          the kitchen, where the Germans continue to raid their other
          supplies.
                         
          One German picks up waterbath canner -- inspecting it.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           What is it?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Leave it if you don't know what it's
           for.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           A pot is a pot. We'll find some use
           for it. Sir, where's the livestock?
          Brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam
          from an open jar.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           I make jam. We have no animals.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           But there's fresh hay in your barn.
                         
          Emilie enters, overhearing.
                         
                          EMILIE
           We use it to replace the mattress
           stuffings.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Her grandfather?
           66.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yes.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           Where are her parents?
                         
                          EMILIE
                          (BREAKING IN)
           They're dead. They died.
                         
          The German nods and is about to take his leave, putting the
          pot back where he found it, when a clumping noise from
          somewhere in the house begins.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           What is that?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           The wind. It plays tricks in the
           attic.
                         
          Brandt licks his finger and tests:
                         
                          BRANDT
           There is no wind.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           An old house creaks.
                          (TO EMILIE)
           Go - close the shutters.
                         
          Emilie runs out of the room. The soldier picks up the
          medicine bottle.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           She's sickly, no?
                          GRANDFATHER
           If you or any of your friends harm
           her, as old as I am, I will kill
           you.
                         
          The soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh. He slaps
          the medicine flask into Grandfather's chest.
                         
                          GERMAN SOLDIER
           You know, I was going to give you
           back your pot. But now I'm going to
           keep it. For soup.
                         
          He slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and
          leaves the house with the other soldiers.
           67.
                         
                          BRANDT
           We will be back in the new season.
                         
          As the Germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where
          Emilie lies curled up on the bed - and there, standing on
          either side of the bed - are the two horses. They look huge
          in the tiny room.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN. LATE THAT NIGHT.
                         
          The sound of shells exploding. A huge bombardment somewhere
          in the deep distance. But much closer than before. The
          distant, malicious giants of war growl.
                         
          It is like a lightning storm on the horizon.
                         
          The kitchen has been emptied. The war has finally come to
          them - and we can see it on Emilie's face.
                          EMILIE
           Tell me what happened to them. To my
           mother and father.
                         
          Grandfather doesn't respond.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           You said you would tell me how they
           died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's
           my birthday! They died fighting,
           didn't they? But when the soldiers
                          COME -
                         
          She finally turns to face him.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           - you do nothing. You are a coward,
           aren't you?
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yes. Yes. It was your parents who
           were brave. I make jams.
                         
                          EMILIE
           And you've never done a brave thing
           in your life?
                         
          He eases himself into a chair and shrugs.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Maybe there are different ways to be
           brave. Did you know the French have
           the best carrier pigeons? And this
           could be the difference in the war -
           our messages getting through.
           68.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I don't want to hear about the
           birds.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           They are released at the front and
           told to go home - this is all they
           know. But to get there they must
           fly over a war. Can you imagine
           such a thing? Here you are flying
           over so much pain and terror - and
           you know you can never look down.
           You have to look forward or you'll
           never get home. I ask you - what
           could be braver than that?
                         
          Emilie sheds a single tear.
          INT. THE BARN. DAWN.
                         
          Grandfather enters the barn, strokes Topthorn's nose as he
          passes. He sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal
          a trap door. Then, he opens it.
                         
          Now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly
          object, covered in another rug.
                         
          INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN. MORNING.
                         
          Emilie comes down the stairs as Grandfather waits proudly by
          the stove. She stops when she sees the OBJECT COVERED BY THE
          RUG.
                         
                          EMILIE
           What is that?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           A present.
                         
          Emilie moves toward the object that is covered.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I hope you have not bought me a
           disgusting dress that I then have to
           wear like last year.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
                          (LAUGHING)
           It was disgusting?
                         
                          EMILIE
           Yes. I looked like an ugly nun.
           69.
                         
          Then she stops herself and turns to Grandfather with a
          parental rebuke.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           Give me your hand.
           (she takes it in hers)
           Grandpére, we have no money. When
           the war is over, then you can buy me
           jewels and carriages.
                         
          The grandfather smiles and gives Emily a hug.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Anything you say, my sweet one.
           Anything-you-say! You are, of
           course, the boss. It's just an old
           thing I found - don't worry yourself
           - leave it, I'll put it back.
          He leaves the room. Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it
          when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the
          rug. She looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not
          being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. Her face
          explodes with a gorgeous smile. She pulls off the rug that
          is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle.
          She runs her hand along the saddle -- can hardly believe it.
                         
          INT. A HILL. JUST BEYOND THE FARMHOUSE. NEAR THE WINDMILL.
          DAY.
                         
          Grandfather helps to swing Emilie up and into the saddle.
          All at once, the Grandfather's charity evaporates.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           It was your mother's. I hid it, so
           as not to encourage you. Emilie, I
           want you to ride very slowly, very
           carefully. And promise me you won't
           go far --
                         
                          EMILIE
           Of course. Okay, I promise.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           To the top of the hill and straight
           back again.
                         
                          EMILIE
           I promise.
                         
          Emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to
          Grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and
          shoulder.
           70.
                         
                          EMILIE (CONT'D)
           My hero.
                         
          She sets off on Joey - and quickly spurs him to a gallop.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Slowly...slowly...
                         
          She rides - past the windmill - and then over the top of a
          nearby hill - she speeds over it and out of sight.
                         
          Back to the hill - a sudden change of mood. An empty shot. No
          movement, no returning girl.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           Emilie!
                         
          Cut again to the top of the hill, then back to the
          Grandfather, very worried.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           Emilie!
                         
          Topthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following,
          sensing danger. Grandfather starts to run in the direction of
          the hill.
                         
          Topthorn charging over the brow of the hill.
                         
          The Grandfather running - out of breath.
                         
          He hears an indistinct scream from Emilie!
                         
          He reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and
          there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been
          fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and
          motorbikes. It is like a line of Indians in a Western -
          total, alien fear.
                         
          And there amongst them is Emilie, astride a panicked Joey,
          surrounded by soldiers. Another one holds Topthorn, who bucks
          and rears, but to no avail. Grandfather starts down the hill
          towards his granddaughter.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN COLUMN NEAR THE WINDMILL. THE SAME
                         
          The Germans are moving through the horses they have gathered.
          Emilie, unhorsed, tries to get to Joey, who is being roughly
          led away by a German soldier.
                         
                          EMILIE
           No! Let go of me! No!
           71.
                         
          Grandfather grabs her. She is screaming. He tries to calm her
          down. Joey is tied up as is Topthorn. Emilie is kicking and
          screaming - but also desperately short of breath.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           She is my granddaughter! Emilie,
           stop! Don't hurt her, please!
           Don't hurt her.
                         
          A soldier roughly shoves Emilie at him.
                         
          Brandt approaches. Emilie screams at him, in tears.
                         
                          EMILIE
           You don't need them! There are so
           many others!
                         
          Emilie is still sobbing. Grandfather hugs her - in horror
          that she is now struggling so hard for breath.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Please, take the bigger one and
           leave the smaller one. You are
           breaking my granddaughter's heart.
                         
                          BRANDT
                          (LEAVING)
           The war has taken everything from
           everyone.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
                          (CALLING AFTER)
           What will happen to them?
                         
                          BRANDT
           They will pull artillery until they
                          DIE -
                          EMILIE
                          (COUGHING)
           François!
                         
                          BRANDT
           - or until the war is over.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           It will never be over!
                         
                          BRANDT
           You have your answer then.
                         
          The motorbikes start up and drive off. The Grandfather
          hugging tiny Emilie as she coughs.
           72.
                         
          The Germans disappear up the lane leaving the old man and the
          child bereft in the bitter cold.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN CAMP. LATER.
                         
          Two grooms trail Brandt, leading Joey and Topthorn toward a
          makeshift corral.
                         
                          BRANDT
           Heiglemann - these are yours.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Yes, sir.
                         
                          BRANDT
           They look strong - should last a
           month or two.
          FRIEDRICH is an unprepossessing, chubby man. He marvels at
          Topthorn.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           You are beautiful.
                         
          But then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard
          and weak. He turns to Joey.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           It's a pity they found you.
                         
          He takes the leads of the pair of them. He sighs...
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Such a pity...
                         
          In a strange way, there are many humans Joey meets, but also
          just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for
          animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film.
                         
          And then they go over a ridge - and we suddenly see the
          explanation of Friedrich's comment. The road they can see
          below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a
          scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and
          artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a
          terrible condition.
                         
          For Joey and Topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers
          arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in Changi
          prison by the Japanese during World War 2. They have never
          seen horses in this condition. You can see in their eyes the
          confusion. This is a whole different world, where horses can
          turn into creatures that look like this.
           73.
                         
          And it is also a vision of their future. This may be the
          moment the mighty Topthorn begins to lose hope. For Joey it
          is another level of knowledge - another mighty thing he will
          fight through - because he always fights through.
                         
          EXT. STEEP INCLINE. DAY.
                         
          Friedrich leads Joey and Topthorn in the wake of THE HUGE
          MORSER - an elaborate 15 ton monstrosity with a six inch
          bore. It takes a team of six horses to haul it with a dozen
          men pushing from behind.
                         
                          ARTILLERY OFFICER
           Pull together!
                         
          A soldier calls from the front of the heavy cannon - pulled
          by a particularly wretched group of horses.
                          ARTILLERY SOLDIER
           Halt! Halt! Stop!
                         
          Lower down the hill, Friedrich waves down the rest of the
          column.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Stop! Stop!
                         
          At the front of the Morser, one of the lead horses collapses -
          he will never get up again.
                         
          Brandt steps up, pulls a revolver out of his pocket and
          shoots the horse dead. It has come to this.
                         
          Joey, Topthorn, and all the other horses are spooked by the
          pistol shot.
                         
          Brandt shouts to Friedrich from the road.
                          BRANDT
           Heiglemann, bring up another one!
                         
                          ARTILLERY OFFICER
           Heiglemann, bring up another horse!
                         
                          BRANDT
           That one!
                         
          Friedrich begins leading Joey up the hill, but --
                         
                          BRANDT (CONT'D)
           No, no. The big black one!
                         
          Friedrich hauls Topthorn, hesitantly, while Joey watches.
           74.
                         
          As he reaches Brandt:
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           He's a good horse, sir. But if you
           move him up to the heavy gun, he
           will be no use at all. Prince is
           already losing condition. His leg,
           sir.
                         
                          BRANDT
           You have given them names?
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Yes, sir.
                         
                          BRANDT
           You should never give a name to
           anything you are certain to lose.
                          FRIEDRICH
           His leg is not good enough, sir.
                         
                          BRANDT
           Private, you will do as you are
           told.
                          (CALLING OFF)
           Hook him up.
                         
          Friedrich has no choice but as he starts to lead Topthorn,
          Joey rears up and escapes his groom. He gallops up the hill
          to the gun - offering himself up to save Topthorn. It is his
          "Tale of Two Cities" moment - giving up his life to save his
          friend. He bucks and rears. Friedrich turns to Brandt.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           As you see, sir, this one is
           stronger.
          Brandt takes up Friedrich, and Joey's, offer -
                         
                          BRANDT
           Hook him up.
                         
          As Joey is hooked to the gun, he looks back to Friedrich who
          leads Topthorn back down the hill.
                         
          EXT. STEEP INCLINE. LATER.
                         
          The convoy struggles up the hill. Joey feels the dead weight
          of the gun. These are several tons of cast iron - almost
          dwarfing the horses. Friedrich notices. Together, this grim
          circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the
          rain.
           75.
                         
          Joey leads the team up the incline. Each step is an immense
          effort. The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed. It
          is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose
          ground, but his experience in Dartmoor comes into play and
          although he almost loses his balance several times he stays
          upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the
          hill.
                         
          We follow his progress step by step. Friedrich watches
          anxiously. Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun. One
          throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction. As they
          reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too
          much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back. Joey
          finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the
          tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the
          cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill.
                         
          EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD. DAY.
          Soldiers scurry around the giant gun, preparing it.
                         
                          OFFICER
           Halt! Halt! Take the horses away!
                         
                          ARTILLERY OFFICER
           Shell!
                         
          Friedrich observes with Topthorn as a giant shell is carried
          to the gun's breech.
                         
           ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
           And load!
                         
          The men wrestle it into place -
                         
           ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
           Back! Case!
          - and secure it.
                         
           ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
           Position!
                         
          The barrel of the giant gun ratchets upward.
                         
           ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D)
           And...fire!
                         
          The shell explodes from the barrel. And then from another.
          And another. For the first time we see the big picture - the
          line of assembled cannons of which they were just one tiny
          part.
           76.
                         
          Each gun recoils violently as they shoot their shells into
          oblivion - as soon as one shell is fired another is loaded -
          the noise is deafening - the line seemingly endless - an
          obscene production line of death. This is what the horses
          have been feeding - this massive merciless thing.
                         
          Smoke wafts from the guns as we see the explosions in the
          distance. The sound of the explosions takes us to -
                         
          EXT. BRITISH TRENCH. NIGHT.
                         
          Explosions light the dirty faces of British boys in uniform,
          one after the next. Each light fading out before the next
          great blast illuminates another anonymous face -then another -
          and then another - and then ALBERT. Hold on him for extra
          moments before he fades completely.
                         
          EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES. EARLY DAWN.
          TITLE: FRANCE - 1918, THE SOMME
                         
          With the barrage lifted, the British soldiers that are
          huddled in a low sub-trench, are ordered back on the line.
          Andrew Easton is with Albert and he's shaken and terrified. A
          far cry from the happy young boy we knew.
                         
          A gruff sergeant (SERGEANT MARTIN) walks the trench with a
          bucket and each soldier puts in their valuables and personal
          belongings. One a lighter, some money, etc.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           Valuables in the bucket, lads. If
           you live, you'll get them back. If
           you live, you'll get them back.
           Good lads.
                         
          Albert and Andrew move down the trench in a line of soldiers
          who are given ammo belts and grenades.
                         
          Albert gets his grenades and walks further along the
          trenches. We follow him in real time as he passes a bunch of
          soldiers who are kneeling in the ankle deep water, a PADRE is
          giving them communion. The deafening noise of shelling all
          around.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe
           it's a drill like last time.
                         
          We keep following Albert's progress in real time - further on
          there is a post box where they all put their final letters
          home in identical green envelopes. We see Albert's letter
          addressed to "Ted and Rose Narracott" in Devon. He posts it
          in a battered metal post box.
           77.
                         
          An officer approaches:
                         
                          DAVID
           Love letter?
                         
                          ALBERT
           That's my business.
                         
          It is David - Lyon's son - now in charge of this small group
          of men. Still arrogant - looking older than Albert in his
          uniform - and clearly enjoying his superior rank.
                         
                          DAVID
           I hear you and your mate were doing
           bird imitations again. You gonna
           write a letter to your horse?
                         
          Albert ignores him. Andrew can't help but giggle.
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           After you find your horse, I've lost
           my needle in a haystack, and I could
           use some help.
                         
          David takes up a bucket and walks down the line of soldiers.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Anything valuable. Anyone who comes
           back gets to share it out.
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (TO ANDREW)
           Stay here.
                         
          Albert follows David down the trench.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Remember that day me and Joey raced
           you in your car?
                         
                          DAVID
           I remember you somersaulting through
           the air.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Who was that girl you were with?
                         
                          DAVID
           There was a girl?
                         
          Albert nods.
                         
                          ALBERT
           There was. Don't you remember?
           78.
                         
                          DAVID
           It was just some girl, I suppose. I
           don't recall which one. I do
           remember you falling on your bum in
           a ditch.
                         
          Andrew laughs amiably. David points to him, smirking.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You see? Always entertaining,
           Narracott, I'll give you that.
                         
          As David walks on, Andrew smiles at Albert.
                         
                          ANDREW
           You did that? You fell on your bum?
                         
          Albert leaves without answering. Andrew keeps smiling until
          a large shell explodes nearby. Troops surge towards their
          ladders as officers scream indistinct orders.
                         
          Now David leads his troop through the trenches to the front
          line where they stop, lean against the enemy-side wall
          nervously and wait - each man in private contemplation.
                         
          Sergeant Martin moves along the lines, pushing men forward.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men,
           get ready to go! Get ready to move
           out! Stay in position!
                         
          David calls out from atop a trench ladder.
                         
                          DAVID
           Hold your nerve, boys. Remember,
           it's not far to go. There's a way
           through.
           (he moves down the line)
           Run fast, keep your wits about you,
           keep your eyes open and God and the
           King will keep an eye on you.
           Company will fix bayonets! Fix
           bayonets!
                         
          The echo of `fix bayonets' goes down the line - and every man
          fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun.
                         
          Then Albert turns to Andrew.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You know what it reminds me of out
           there?
           79.
                         
                          ANDREW
           What?
                         
                          ALBERT
           That bloody impossible lower field
           the day me and Joey plowed it. Best
           day of my life that was and you were
           there.
                         
                          ANDREW
           And this here is the worst day of my
           life, about to begin, and you're
           here cheering me on. Us two, always.
           And him.
                         
          He nods at David Lyons, who gives instructions to another
          soldier.
                          DAVID
           Once you're in no man's land, go to
           the flanks. Stay on the flanks.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Yes, sir.
                         
          David turns to Albert and Andrew.
                         
                          DAVID
           Come on, boys, come on. To the
           ladder!
                         
                          ALBERT
                          (TO ANDREW)
           Stick close to the gentry, that's
           our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck
           but they have the luck.
          They both smile. And then the fear takes over again. Andrew
          particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now.
          David urges them forward.
                         
                          DAVID
           You, too, Narracott.
                          (TO ANDREW)
           And you, too.
                         
          Andrew and Albert pass by the bucket. They throw some
          valuables in. But a moment later, Albert goes back to the
          bucket and pulls something out - a worn piece of paper - he
          unfolds it - it is the little sketch that Captain Nicholls
          drew of Joey the night before they left for France. He slips
          it inside his shirt, next to his heart.
           80.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Come on, on your ladders, boy. On
           your ladders. In you go, in you go.
           That's it.
                         
          Andrew turns towards a ladder. As fate and placement would
          have it - he is first in line. He puts his foot on the
          ladder, when suddenly the Sergeant stops him.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           Listen to your sergeant!
                         
          He pulls Andrew aside, speaking so that everyone can hear.
                         
           SERGEANT MARTIN (CONT'D)
           If anybody turns back, if any one of
           our boys come running towards you -
           you take this rifle and you shoot
           them dead. Do you understand?
                         
                          SOLDIERS
           Yes, sir!
                         
          The sergeant pushes in on Andrew, private and intense.
                         
                          SERGEANT
           Do you understand me? Do you
           understand what I'm telling you,
           son? You take this rifle and you
           shoot them dead. Understand?
                         
          Andrew looks ready to cry, but manages to nod. Albert turns
          to him, only to be pushed back by the sergeant.
                         
                          SERGEANT (CONT'D)
           Up there, son. Up your ladder. Up
           your ladder to your work!
          Albert looks nervously back at Albert, comforting.
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's good. Andrew, it's good.
           Andrew! Nobody's retreating today.
           Andrew! Andrew! Nobody. Is
           retreating. Today.
                         
          The COMMANDER arrives, checks the time on his AIDE's watch,
          mounts his ladder and blows a whistle to signal the charge.
          A BAGPIPER plays as the men go over the top.
                         
          David now heads up the ladder first. Gun fire overhead,
          Albert steels himself, then hauls himself over the top,
          followed by the next man and the next.
           81.
                         
          Immediately machine gun fire whistles past, we hear the
          screams of the first men who are shot. We follow Albert.
                         
          We are him. His vision. His experience. The ground is
          blasted, there are bodies all around him. He tries to run but
          his feet sink into the mud. Bullets fly past him. Felled men
          are screaming at his feet in fear and agony. Albert staggers
          forward. David is now right by him. They run together. Albert
          looks round and suddenly, David is hit. He falls to the
          ground, screaming.
                         
                          DAVID
           I'm shot! No!
                         
          Albert instinctively goes to help. Bullets shower all around
          him.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Just leave me. Leave me!
                         
          Albert grabs him and drags him onwards with him - David
          screaming at the pain - Albert grimly determined. Shells
          explode around them as they stumble on. Other men are
          running and falling. Albert sees cover in a huge shell-hole
          so dives into it for a moment's reprieve from the gun fire.
          He sits in still terror for a moment.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You'll be all right here. You'll be
           safe. Someone'll come for ya.
                         
                          DAVID
           Albert. Albert, listen...
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's all right. It's all right.
           We're Devon boys, yeah?
          David looks at Albert as though seeing him for the first
          time.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yeah...
                         
          Albert races onward.
                         
          Back at the trench, Andrew waits - terrified - and then, back
          out of the mist step two men - heading back towards him. Then
          a third. They suddenly catch sight of Andrew waiting there
          with his gun pointed towards them. They slow down - in the
          terror of the assault, they had forgotten that death was
          waiting for them if they turned back.
           82.
                         
          Time seems to slow down - Andrew shifts his gun from pointing
          at one - to the other - we see their individual faces. They
          are all just boys really.
                         
          And suddenly, instinct hits Andrew - he charges up the
          ladder, and forward, firing - past the three men, towards the
          enemy. He chooses his death instead of theirs. A sudden
          barrage of machine gun fire all around him.
                         
          Cut back to Albert, who makes his way to the edge of the
          shell hole. Bullets whizz inches from his head. He looks over
          to see a German machine gun position to his right. Bullets
          whizz past forcing him to duck.
                         
          Andrew charges past other soldiers, ignoring their warnings.
                         
                          RANDOM SOLDIER
           Get down!
          Albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole,
          nearer to the German line. He scrambles from shell hole to
          shell hole. Now he's very close to the machine gun position.
                         
          Albert takes a grenade, fumbles with the pin as his hands
          tremble. He finally gets the pin out and he hurls the
          grenade at the machine gunner. We see the explosion and the
          machine gun stop. Albert sprints over the top again and makes
          it all the way into the German trench.
                         
          Albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty.
          Albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas-
          masked German holding a rifle on him.
                         
          Albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped
          backwards against the side of the trench still upright.
          Albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him,
          ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead
          German soldiers.
                         
          Albert is alone, everyone else is dead. All the dead wear
          gas masks.
                         
          More British soldiers drop into the trench, among them
          Andrew. He stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers
          it, and races through the trench.
                         
          He glimpses Albert ahead of him, stalking through the mist.
          Andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward, prompting
          Albert to whirl with his rifle raised.
                         
                          ANDREW
           NO!
           83.
                         
          Albert pauses just in time. Then he collapses against the
          side of the trench, overwhelmed.
                         
                          ANDREW (CONT'D)
           Albie.
                         
          Andrew grabs Albert and holds him up, embracing him. Albert
          can barely whisper:
                         
                          ALBERT
           We made it. We made it.
                         
          A moment later, the pair of them hurry through the trenches.
          Albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to
          Andrew.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           Andrew, this way out!
          Suddenly ANOTHER SOLDIER leaps from a trench branch between
          them, shouting in panic.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Gas! Gas! Gas!
                         
          An instant later, a gas cloud blasts through the trench.
          Andrew and Albert look in horror. It spreads towards them,
          too powerful to avoid. Andrew is closest, turns to Albert
          with a helpless -
                         
                          ANDREW
           Albie...
                         
          - before he takes the full power of it. An instant later, the
          white, deadly cloud encompasses Albert, too...
                         
          EXT. EDGE OF THE BATTLEFIELDS. DUSK.
          Close on hooves and boots, slogging through muddy water,
          several inches deep.
                         
          Friedrich is walking along, leading Topthorn and Joey.
          Topthorn is limping.
                         
          Something is wrong - Topthorn seems to be failing - he coughs
          badly, breathes strangely. Friedrich stops to check on him.
          An officer notices.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep
           them moving.
           84.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Sir, there's something wrong. This
           one needs to rest.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           There's no rest for them. Move them
           along. Move them along!
                         
          Instead, Friedrich leads the horses under the cover of a low
          bridge for a brief respite. A moment later, Topthorn
          collapses.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Please, please, please. Stay on
           your feet. No, please. No no no...
                         
          Friedrich tries to help Topthorn valiantly struggling to get
          up but finally sinks to the ground again. This time he lies
          semi-conscious. He is dying.
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Please please... Stay on your feet.
                         
          Joey deeply upset nuzzles his nose into Topthorn but the life
          drains out him. Friedrich is in panic at Topthorn's quick
                         DECLINE:
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Come on. Please please...
                         
          Friedrich continues to stroke Topthorn's head. Joey pushes
          Topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness. For
          a moment we think Topthorn will come round but he slips away
          and all life leaves his body. Friedrich solemnly strokes the
          horse, knowing all is lost.
                         
          Joey does not understand. He pulls at Topthorn's reins, as if
          trying to pull him upright. Topthorn's body is inert, his
          head falls to the earth. Joey will not give up, he pulls at
          him desperately not understanding that Topthorn has died.
                         
          Suddenly, Friedrich looks around. Chaos - all the German
          soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get
          their guns and helmets. An officer charges down the bank next
          to the bridge, screaming orders at Friedrich.
                         
                          GERMAN OFFICER
           They're coming! Leave it, private!
                         
          Friedrich tries to pull Joey away to safety but Joey will not
          leave Topthorn's body. Friedrich pulls at Joey, but Joey is
          too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the
          danger.
           85.
                         
           GERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D)
           Leave it! Come with me!
                         
                          FRIEDRICH
           Go to hell!
                         
          The officer nods to two other soldiers who pull Friedrich to
          safety. As he's dragged away, he screams at Joey:
                         
                          FRIEDRICH (CONT'D)
           Run. Run! Run! Run!
                         
          But this is all background noise to Joey's profound refusal
          to accept Topthorn is dead. He paws at the ground next to
          Topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field,
          and he will never leave him.
                         
          And then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the
          streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for
          Joey. He bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he
          reaches a barbed wire barrier - a dead end. He attempts to
          run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well. He rears up,
          but the tank keeps advancing.
                         
          The tank is about to crush Joey. He has left it too late. He
          is about to die.
                         
          But then, counter-intuitively, he runs straight towards the
          tank and...leaps over it - a leap he learnt from Emilie. Then
          scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind.
                         
          Joey keeps on running. He is wild, frightened.
                         
          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE / VILLAGE / TRENCH. THE SAME.
                         
          Joey is free - in countryside - but there is blood pouring
          from his leg, clearly torn by his encounter with the tank. He
          runs on - it is becoming night - suddenly there are
          explosions to the left of him - this fast, elegant creature
          simply runs through the gaps between explosions.
                         
          But as he charges on - the sky lights up in the direction he
          is heading. He is suddenly in the thick of battle. A shell
          explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench.
          Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - he
          finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and he
          races through it - and finds himself charging towards a
          German company. Both sides are equally startled - Joey
          charging through a thin trench lined with German soldiers -
          the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them.
                         
          In desperation, Joey scrambles out of the trench - and once
          again, rushes away from the fighting...
           86.
                         
          But now it is very dark indeed - he is stumbling as he runs -
          there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs.
                         
          Now it is total night - fog - confusion - he jumps again. And
          now everywhere there are potholes - the land is massively
          uneven - shells are exploding all around. And suddenly sees
          in front of him barbed wire. He crashes through it - more -
          he bursts through again - now dragging barriers behind him -
          the barriers tangle, pulling him up short - he flips and
          lands amongst even more barbed wire.
                         
          He pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossible.
          The more he pulls, the more firmly he is trapped. He rises
          up, wild, magnificent, a beast fighting for his life.
                         
          He is completely trapped. He cannot move. He cannot see. He
          is in pain. He falls. It feels like an end.

          A young soldier, a Geordie, is on look-out duty. He looks
          through a periscope. He alerts his colleague in his thick,

           It looks like a cow.
                         
          He passes the periscope to the second soldier.
                          SOLDIER
           What the hell would a cow be doing out
           there?
                         
          We see what he sees - nothing but morning mist on the surreal
          landscape - and something strange. It is Joey in the distance
                         
                          SOLDIER 2
           That definitely isn't a cow.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           (handing over periscope)
           Well, what is it?
           87.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME.
                         
          We see an almost identical scene of several German soldiers
          looking out at Joey just as the British soldiers had done.
                         
                          SECOND GERMAN
           It can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be
           out there.
                         
                          THIRD GERMAN
           It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse.
                         
          The first German looks through his periscope. We see what he
          sees - Joey in the mist:
                         
                          SECOND GERMAN
           Yes - it's a horse.
          The second German looks through the periscope, stunned.
                         
                          THIRD GERMAN
           It's a horse.
                         
          A third German (PETER) lowers his binoculars.
                         
                          PETER
           Yeah, it's a horse.
                         
          EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES. THE SAME.
                         
          Now all the soldiers are gathering to look out at Joey. A
          CAPTAIN now has the periscope.
                         
                          BRITISH CAPTAIN
           Well, bugger me. It's a horse.
                         
                          GEORDIE SOLDIER
           Lads, we should call him.
                         
                          BRITISH SOLDIER
           How do you call a horse?
                         
          The Geordie starts clicking his tongue, followed by all of
          his comrades. They all try to attract Joey's attention with
          tongue clicks.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME.
                         
          The Germans hear the clicks and respond with a chorus of
          whistles.
                         
          EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES. THE SAME.
                         
          Now both sides are whistling. Even the captain joins in.
           88.
                         
          EXT. NO MAN'S LAND. THE SAME.
                         
          Joey tries to rise, but remains entangled. He whinnies in
          pain.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME.
                         
          Peter lowers his binoculars.
                         
                          PETER
           He's caught on the wire.
                         
          EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES, THE SAME.
                         
                          GEORDIE SOLDIER
           Oh sod it...
                         
          Geordie climbs up the side of the trench, and waves a white
          handkerchief tied to the end of his bayonet.
                         
                          BRITISH CAPTAIN
           What do you think you're doing? Get
           back, do you hear me? Corporal,
           that's an order! Get back!
                         
          Geordie, not receiving fire, is emboldened to stand up.
                         
                          BRITISH SOLDIER
           Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.
                         
          He waves the handkerchief to clearly signal he is no threat.
                         
          EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME.
                         
          The Germans look at the young soldier making his way over No
          Man's Land.
                          PETER
           What's he doing?
                         
                          SECOND GERMAN
           It's a trap.
                         
                          PETER
           No, I don't think so. I think he's
           trying to help.
                         
          The second German cocks his rifle and starts to take aim.
                         
                          THIRD GERMAN
           Scare him back into his hole.
                         
          The second German takes a shot aimed over the Geordie's
          shoulder.
           89.
                         
          EXT. NO MAN'S LAND. THE SAME.
                         
          The Geordie crouches for cover, waving his handkerchief more
          frantically.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           It's a white flag, ent it? You see
           the white flag!? I'm just after
           tending to this here horse, is all!
                         
          The Georgie marshals his courage and stands again, waving the
          handkerchief.
                         
                          BRITISH CAPTAIN
           Get back, you stupid git!
                         
          There's no fire from the German trenches. Muttering to
          himself, the Geordie marches forward towards Joey:
                          GEORDIE
           The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
           want, he leadeth me into green
           pastures, he lay me down beside the
           still waters...
                         
          The Geordie walks very slowly across the mud - there are
          bodies - the ground squelches beneath his feet. He waves his
          handkerchief as he walks. He crosses a narrow bridge that
          spans a flooded bomb crater.
                         
          Joey, lying on his side, wrapped head to toe in barbed wire,
          covered in mud, watches Geordie approach. When Geordie gets
          too close, Joey freaks out and begins thrashing about. Joey
          whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into
          his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him
          deeper. Particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped
          around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to
          slash it. The Geordie calls out in a soothing voice:
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           Poor beastie. Poor babbie. It's
           alright. It's alright. Don't buck
           and wriggle so, you're only
           shredding yourself.
                         
          Joey calms a little, still moving his head up and down.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           You'll blind yourself.
                         
          He reaches Joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in
          which Joey's bundled. The Geordie soothes and at the same
          time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where
          to begin.
           90.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           Bugger me worthless - I didn't think
           to bring gloves or something to cut
                          THE -
                         
          He stabs his hand on one of the barbs.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           OW! DAMN! OW!!
                         
          There's a noise behind him, and the Geordie turns around to
          see the Peter (the German from the trench) standing several
          feet away, holding some wire cutters.
                         
                          PETER
           I thought perhaps you might need
           these.
          He holds out the wire cutters. The Geordie, still
          frightened, stares stupidly at them.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           For the barbed wire?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks.
           Cheers. Cheers...
                         
          He reaches out and takes the proffered cutters.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           Thanks.
                         
          He returns to Joey, nervous about turning his back. He tries
          to figure out where to begin cutting. He lifts a long strand
          of wire that wraps around Joey's neck, stretches across his
          shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs. He puts
          the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip
          when Peter steps closer to him.
                         
                          PETER
           That...That's a very long strand.
           When you cut it, it's going to
           release this -
                         
          He points to a wire wrapped around the wire the Geordie's
          lifting. Then he points to two other wires, similarly
                         ENTANGLED:
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           - and this, and this, and they'll
           coil back rather violently, which
           I'm afraid will only wound the poor
           fellow further.
           91.
                         
          The Geordie nods.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           You speak good English.
                         
                          PETER
           I speak English well.
           (re: the cutters)
           May I?
                         
          The Geordie hands them over and Peter surveys the wires.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           What if we cut his head free first?
           So he won't try to stand up and
           blind himself? And then -
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Pity you didn't bring a second pair.
           Then I could cut the wire here -
                         
          He points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd
          been prepared to cut.
                         
          Peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench.
                         
                          PETER
           WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS!
                         
          All at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come
          soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater.
                         
          Moments later - Peter and the Geordie kneel beside Joey, each
          with a pair of cutters.
                         
          Joey is calming down again.
          The Geordie positions himself across Joey's body so that when
          he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut Joey. Peter
          positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick
          succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing
          back.
                         
          Joey's completely still now.
                         
          Peter points between Joey's eyes.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           His blind spot. The cutters won't
           frighten him. If you could cut
           here, holding this wire -
                         
          He points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses
          Joey's eye. Then he points to the wire across Joey's eye.
           92.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           I could -
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Say no more, I'm right behind you.
                         
          As they reposition themselves, the Geordie says to Joey:
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           And you understand what's happening,
           do you not, O Best Beloved? That you
           must lay so very nice and still.
           There's a lad, you're a remarkable
           horse, you are, helping us help you.
           There's a lad. There's a remarkable
           lad.
                         
          The Geordie looks into Joey's huge eye as he and Peter get to
          work on their cutting. Joey returns his gaze.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           So how's things in yonder trench?
                         
                          PETER
           Delightful. We read, we knit
           sweaters, and we train our rats to
           perform circus tricks.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Well, if ever you need any more
           rats, we can always send ours over.
           `Cause we've more than we need,
           strictly speaking. Besides, they
           scare off all the pretty girls.
                         
                          PETER
           Our girls aren't afraid of rats.
                          GEORDIE
           Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind
           what gives robust massages?
                         
          They laugh.
                         
                          PETER
           Every Thursday! And they bring rum
           cake on your birthday.
                         
          Both men smile at this while Joey is completely still; they
          work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of
          the wire.
           93.
                         
          Joey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs
          a little. The two soldiers smile at one another. Then they
          set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now.
                         
          The Geordie cuts through the last wire binding Joey's legs.
          The two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Look at that horse! Look at the
           muscles he's got, them long legs.
           They're made for running, horses.
           Runnin' away from danger.
                         
                          PETER
           Running away is all they have.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Yet we taught `em opposite. Running
           into the fray.
                         
                          PETER
           War horse.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Yeah. War horse. And there he is.
           What a strange beast you've become.
                         
          The Geordie grabs hold of Joey's halter, though Joey shows no
          sign of running.
                         
          Joey is finally free.
                         
          The two men look at each other.
                         
                          PETER
           And now?
                          GEORDIE
           I take him back with me, yeah?
                         
                          PETER
           Since I supplied the cutters, the
           horse is mine. This is fair, no?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           In a pig's eye. He's English, plain
           to see.
                         
                          PETER
           Oh, you mean because he's so filthy?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Because he's so smart. And you're
           none too clean yourself.
           94.
                         
                          PETER
           We could box. And the winner gets
           the horse.
                         
          The Geordie smiles.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           No, thanks, pet. Must be careful not
           to start a war.
           (patting his pockets:)
           Do you have a coin of any sort?
                         
                          PETER
           Coin toss?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Yeah.
          He takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the Geordie, who
          looks at it.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           All right, Fritz - you're on.
                         
          He flips the coin back to Peter.
                         
                          PETER
           My name is not Fritz - it is Peter.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Peter - I'm Colin.
                         
                          PETER
           You call it, Colin.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Heads.
          Peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud. They
          look down. Peter shakes his head, resigned.
                         
                          PETER
           That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not
           look pleased with me. The horse is yours.
                         
          They collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around
          them.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Gone quiet, hasn't it?
                         
                          PETER
           Yes.
                          (PAUSE)
                          (MORE)
           95.
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting
           again.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe
           I'll ever hit the target.
                         
          He hands back the cutters.
                         
                          PETER
           Thanks.
                         
          He notices the Geordie has offered his hand, as well. A
          beat, then Peter shakes with him.
                         
                          PETER (CONT'D)
           Cheerio, mate.
                          (RE JOEY:)
           You'll take good care of him, yes?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           I will.
                         
                          PETER
           Our strange beast.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           And you take care of your own
           strange self.
                         
          Peter tosses Geordie his cutters.
                         
                          PETER
           Colin! A pair of German cutters - in memory
           of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Thanks.
                         
          Peter nods, and walks back to his trench. As he goes, the
          Geordie calls after him:
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           I'll use `em back in the garden in
           South Shields. You keep your head
           down, now, Pete me lad!
                         
          As he walks away, Peter turns back briefly, calling:
                         
                          PETER
           Remarkable! A remarkable horse!
                         
          The Geordie leads Joey towards the British trenches.
           96.
                         
          EXT. TRENCHES. THE SAME.
                         
          Joey is now in the trenches, splashing about in the ankle
          deep water. He seems enormous in this cramped labyrinth. He
          is led past the broken and wounded soldiers who look at him
          with amazement, dumbfounded. It is a surreal image. The horse
          where horses shouldn't be.
                         
          As Joey makes his journey through the trenches soldiers
          excitedly gather to watch him come by, taking pleasure in the
          saving of this single life.
                         
          EXT. TRENCHES. THE SAME.
                         
          We arrive at a section we recognise as the place from where
          Albert set off only the night before. Sergeant Martin is
          there - as one man helps a wounded soldier into a medical
          area. It is David, hobbling and looking shell-shocked.
          Another wounded soldier approaches, but Martin waves him on.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           We're full up. Move on.
                         
          David is seated next to Albert, who now seems in worse
          condition. His eyes are bandaged and he's wheezing. Andrew
          is nowhere to be seen. As a MEDICAL OFFICER checks Albert:.
                         
                          DAVID
           The gas got him - we had to wait
           till morning.
                         
          The medic moves to Sergeant Martin, looking stricken.
                         
                          MEDICAL OFFICER
           This can't be all of us.
                         
                          SERGEANT MARTIN
           This is all.
           (bellowing to the men)
           All walking wounded, away to the
           dressing station! Away to the
           dressing station!
                         
          EXT. HOSPITAL AREA. LATER.
                         
          Joey is led into the hospital area beyond the trenches. The
          Geordie leads him through the snowy streets. Bandaged men
          strewn around, wounded soldiers waiting for attention.
                         
          The waiting soldiers gather to view the strange spectacle of
          the horse.
           97.
                         
          At one of the dressing areas, a NURSE tends to Albert's
          damaged eyes. Behind him, we see Joey pass in the street,
          but Albert doesn't know it.
                         
          Joey limps, his foreleg clearly injured. The Geordie soldier
          stops outside a makeshift hospital. Joey looks frail and
          exhausted.
                         
          A DOCTOR storms over from his patients.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           What's this doing here?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           We need a vet, sir.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           There are no vets. We've scarcely
           any horses left.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           He's cut all over, but this leg
           here's got the worst of it.
                         
          Geordie strokes Joey as the Doctor examines him.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Please, sir -
                         
          The Doctor heads back into the hospital, dismissive.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           I've all these men to take care of,
           corporal, you can see that, can't
           you?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Please, sir, this horse can pull
           through anything.
                         
          The doctor absorbs his earnest appeal.
                         
          EXT. INTENSIVE CARE TENT. SAME.
                         
          Elsewhere, a line of soldiers waiting for medical assistance
          are curious about what is going on. Blinded by gas, eyes
          bandaged, one of them turns toward the commotion. It is
          Albert.
                         
                          ALBERT
           What is it?
           98.
                         
                          AN ORDERLY
           It's a horse they found, wandering about in
           No Man's Land.
           (easing him back onto a
                          COT)
           Down you go.
                         
                          ALBERT
           What kind of an horse?
                         
                          AN ORDERLY
           Bloody miraculous kind of an horse,
           be my guess. Nothing makes it out
           of No Man's Land.
                         
          Albert lies there, but can't let go of the thought:
                         
                          ALBERT
           Miraculous horse...
                         
          EXT. HOSPITAL AREA. SAME.
                         
          Joey stands - breathing very deeply. The Doctor touches his
          wounded leg.
                         
          The men from all over the medical area gather around Joey
          concerned about their new hero's pain.
                         
          The doctor looks at the Geordie and frowns shaking his head
          "no."
                         
                          GEORDIE
           (to the doctor:)
           He was alive, y'see, sir, where
           nothing survives, so to me and me
           mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well,
           we have high hopes for him -
                          DOCTOR
           You should shoot him now.
                         
          The Geordie is broken hearted.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Oh, but I can't.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not
           going to mend.
                         
          The Doctor sadly addresses a nearby Sergeant.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Sergeant. Put him out of his misery.
           99.
                         
          The doctor nods his head towards Joey. The sergeant, SERGEANT
          FRY, takes his gun from his holster, checks that it's loaded.
          He turns to some nearby NURSES, urging them away.
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           Ladies, if you please.
                         
          Total silence from the crowd who have gathered. They thought
          they were there to see something wonderful. And now they find
          that they've gathered for an execution - but can't take their
          eyes off it. The Sergeant waves them back.
                         
           SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
           All right, back off. Back off.
                         
          The Geordie is the last to step away from Joey. The sergeant
          draws breath - before he steps forward to take aim. Joey is
          totally still, sensing the atmosphere.
          The sergeant cocks his pistol.
                         
          Suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards
          away. Joey looks around startled.
                         
          The sergeant turns Joey's head back around, raises his pistol
          once more.
                         
          Then, the whistle again. Even the doctor notices this time.
                         
          Joey turns. Slowly, the crowd parts - another owl whistle -
          and we see Albert, his eyes bandaged - walking forward
          blindly - guided by the hands of the crowd.
                         
          One soldier urges Albert gently.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Go on. Do it again.
          One more whistle.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Joey?
                         
          And this time, Joey trots over to Albert. The horse nuzzles
          into him. Albert can't see Joey but he touches him.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
                          (SOFTLY:)
           Hello, Joey. Hello boy. Where you
           been then, hey? Where in the world
           you been?
                         
          He strokes Joey's mane. Joey responds, becoming very still.
          The Doctor approaches with the Geordie.
           100.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           (to the Geordie:)
           Do you know this man?
                         
          The Geordie shakes his head, no. The Doctor speaks to Albert,
          gently; clearly he thinks he's dealing with a traumatized,
          possibly crazy soldier.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           What's your name?
                         
          Albert, realizing he's being addressed, turns to the doctor.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Narracott, Private Albert Narracott,
           sir.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           This is a random horse, Narracott,
           and too badly injured.
           (to the orderly)
           Is this man in your care?
                         
                          AN ORDERLY
           Yes, sir.
                         
                          ALBERT
           He's not random at all, sir! He's my
           horse, I raised him, in Devon. Sir,
           look at his legs! He's got four
           white socks, he's brown all over -
           (points to his own
                          FOREHEAD)
           - and he has a white mark here -
           like so...
                         
          He makes the shape of a diamond with his hands. The doctor
          turns to the orderly.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Take him back.
                         
                          AN ORDERLY
           Come on, son.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Wait! You can't see `cause of the
           mud.
                         
          The Geordie looks around, spots a bucket of water, grabs it
          and uses a rag to clean Joey's legs, revealing the socks. The
          Geordie looks at the doctor.
           101.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           Four white socks!
                         
          The doctor takes a rag himself and wipes Joey's snout,
          revealing the white diamond mark.
                         
          The Sergeant takes this in...and holsters his pistol.
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           All right, break it up. Clear off,
           the lot of ya.
                         
                          ALBERT
           You see, sir? He's not random at
           all.
                         
          The doctor steps up to him.
                          DOCTOR
           We will attend to your horse. Patch
           him up best we can. Treat him like
           the soldier he is.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          With one last amazed look at Albert and Joey, the doctor
          returns to the hospital area.
                         
          Moments later - Albert, the Geordie, and Sergeant Fry all
          lead Joey through the snowy street together.
                         
          EXT. MESS HALL. EARLY MORNING.
                         
          Sergeant Fry strides into the middle of the throng of
          soldiers.
                          SERGEANT FRY
           Gentlemen! Gentlemen! It falls on me to give
           you some important news. At eleven o'clock
           today, in two minutes time - the War will
           come to an end.
                         
          Shock from the troops. Strangely muted. Not the explosion of
          emotion you might have expected.
                         
          Albert enters, his eyes still red, but no longer bandaged.
                         
           SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
           The King and Queen thank you for your
           service. We have been victorious - even if
           at a higher price than many of us might have
           imagined.
                          (MORE)
           102.
           SERGEANT FRY (CONT'D)
           When the bells ring out - and they will in a
           moment, for the first time for four years -
           let us remember our brothers fallen in the
           field. And thank God for the end of this
           struggle and victory.
                         
          And, in the distance, the church bells ring.
                         
          INT. STABLES. THE SAME.
                         
          Joey stands tall, eating some hay, now healed.
                         
          INT. FIELD OFFICE. DAY.
                         
          Complete change of atmosphere. Silence. Tension. Albert
          stands at attention with Sergeant Fry. A severe Major is
          behind his desk.
                          ALBERT
           I don't understand, sir.
                         
                          MAJOR TOMPKINS
           Officers' horses only. All other
           horses are to be auctioned
           immediately.
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           That is a complete and bloody outrage. It's
           the lad's horse, sir, from Devon. He raised
           him up from a pup, he did. Trained him
           right up to the day when the army came to
           town.
                         
                          MAJOR TOMPKINS
           These aren't my orders, sergeant.
                          (TO ALBERT)
           You'll have to take him to market. That's
           all.
                         
          INT. STABLES, DAY.
                         
          Albert puts on a brave face as he collects Joey and leads him
          out of the stables in silence.
                         
          EXT. THE STABLES, THE SAME.
                         
          As Albert comes out the men have gathered. There's a strange
          sense of optimism, for such a gloomy moment. The Geordie
          comes up to Albert and hands him a sheaf of pound notes.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           We've all clubbed together. It's everything
           we have. There's twenty-nine pounds there.
           Buy him back.
           103.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Does the Major know?
                         
                          GEORDIE
           The Major put in ten.
                         
          The Geordie flashes a sly wink.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           Mum's the word where the Major's
           concerned. Your friend on the
           crutches over there -
                         
          He turns to indicate David Lyons, who nods at Albert
          solemnly.
                         
                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)
           - even asked the Major to say that
           Joey was his, an officer's horse, so
           that he could go back with the
           others.
                         
          Albert is amazed. He is about to show his gratitude when the
          sergeant major shouts:
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't
           want to miss the show.
                         
          Albert snaps to attention and begins to lead Joey out of the
          parade ground with the other horses.
                         
          As they walk off, the sergeant silently adds some of his own
          money to the notes in Albert's hand.
                         
          EXT. MARKET PLACE. DAY.
          The intense bustle of the market. Farmers are gathered,
          bidding for horses.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Seven pounds! Seven pounds there!
           Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!
                         
          A groom leads Joey to the auction pen with other horses.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
           Eight pounds! Ten pounds here! Any
           advance? Sold!
                         
          INT. AUCTION PEN. THE SAME.
                         
          Albert waits anxiously, the Geordie lad by his side, as Joey
          is led into the pen.
           104.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than
           fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work
           horses.
                         
          The auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Next one. We start at four pounds.
           Four pounds.
                         
          The farmers seem disinterested, shaking of heads. The bidding
          starts. Five pounds, six, seven, now it goes slowly, eight,
          nine, ten. Albert looks pleased at how it's going. He feels
          the cash in his hand. It seems to stick on ten, then a new
          hand comes up at the back of the auction - it is a nasty
          looking moustached man.
                          THE BUTCHER
           Eleven.
                         
          Sergeant Fry scowls.
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's
           been bidding for the best all
           morning.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds.
                         
                          SERGEANT FRY
           Let me handle this, private.
           (he calls out) )
           Fifteen, and let that be an end to it.
                         
          He looks daggers at the Butcher.
                          AUCTIONEER

          The men are all looking very worried... There's not much
          left.
                          SERGEANT FRY
           Twenty seven.

          Then, from the back, another, new French voice...
                          FINAL BIDDER
           One hundred pounds.
                         
          He steps to the front of the crowd, and suddenly we see who
          it is. It is Emilie's Grandfather.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           And sir, if you bid against me, I will sell
           the coat on my back and bid to one hundred
           and ten. And if you bid against me again, I
           will sell my farm and bid to a thousand.
                         
          Everyone looks at Albert who is devastated. Albert is
          reeling. He hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and
          brings down his gavel.
           106.
                         
                          AUCTIONEER
           One hundred pounds. Going, going,
           gone.
                         
          The soldiers slowly disperse, leaving Albert to stare at
          Joey. It really is all over.
                         
          EXT. THE AUCTION. THE SAME.
                         
          The Grandfather finishes paying for Joey. Albert and the
          Geordie stand in front of the grandfather.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Sir, I'll give you all your money.
           Everything you paid when we get back
           to England. I'll give you twice -
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           You don't know anything about him.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know
           everything!
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Yes, you found him! I heard you
           found a horse in the wire between
           the armies -
                         
                          GEORDIE
           No, I found him, he raised him -
                         
          The Grandfather goes to Joey and takes his reins.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           When I heard about the miracle
           horse, I traveled three days because
           I knew whose horse it was. My
           granddaughter's. She saved his life!
           He was everything to her.
                         
          He pauses, briefly, to collect himself.
                         
                          GEORDIE
           Where is your granddaughter?
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           The war has taken everything from
           everyone. He is all that I have left
           of her.
                         
          The Grandfather leads Joey away. Joey pulls, firmly but not
          wildly, on the rein the grandfather's holding. The
          grandfather lets go.
           107.
                         
          He watches as Joey walks to Albert and nuzzles him. They have
          a moment together. The Grandfather watches carefully.
                         
          Albert puts his face right near Joey - speaks gently.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I
           won't worry over you none. Hey, I
           found you, didn't I, and you found
           me.
                         
          Grandfather softens and begins to wonder about this soldier.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           And we'll both... we'll both know
           that we made it through. Now go on.
                         
          He leads Joey back to the Grandfather.
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           We're the lucky ones. Always have
           been. Lucky since the day I met you.
                         
          He quietly hands over the reins.
                         
                          ALBERT (CONT'D)
           God be with you, sir.
                         
          The grandfather looks at Albert, then takes the regimental
          pennant from his pocket:
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           Do you know what this is?
                         
          Albert's amazed.
                         
                          ALBERT
           It's my father's. It's his
           regimental pennant. How did you come
           by this, sir?
                         
          Grandfather hands Albert the pennant.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           You may have this.
                         
          Albert takes the pennant and looks at it, his eyes filling
          with tears.
                         
                          ALBERT
           Thank you ever so much for this,
           sir...
           108.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER
           (with a sigh)
           ... And this.
                         
          He hands Albert Joey's reins. Albert turns to face him,
          almost mute with disbelief. He reaches for his money.
                         
                          GRANDFATHER (CONT'D)
           No no, not necessary. He belongs to
           you. That is, of course, what my
           little girl would have wanted. And
           she was the boss.
                         
          Grandfather laughs, then turns and slowly walks away.
                         
                          ALBERT
           What was her name?
                          GRANDFATHER
           Emilie.
           (turns back with a smile)
           Her name is Emilie.
                         
          Albert gently embraces Joey.
                         
          EXT. FIELD. DEVON. DUSK.
                         
          Suddenly, we are back in the village in Devon, in the fold of
          the valley. Dusk light. A figure approaches, silhouetted
          against the setting sun.
                         
          Mrs. Naracott gathers the harvest, then notices as the figure
          makes its way up the road to the farm.
                         
          A man in uniform. On a magnificent horse. Mrs. Narracott
          meets them at the gate and we can finally see them clearly -
          Albert and Joey.
          Albert dismounts and removes his cap. An instant later, Mrs.
          Narracott is hugging him for all that her life is worth.
                         
          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FIELD. DEVON. THE SAME.
                         
          Ted sees them and makes his way to the field gate...shaky.
          Albert approaches, and stops a slight distance away.
                         
          Ted opens the gate to stand before his son. Albert slips
          something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand -
          Ted's campaign pennant.
                         
          Ted accepts it quietly, then offers his hand to Albert. They
          shake, as men. And then slowly embrace, as father and son.
           109.
                         
          Mrs. Narracott joins them as Joey looks on - a small family
          and a beautiful horse, finally home.
                         
                          THE END

    A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way
    through a gray sky before being obliterated.

    A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge
    of a boat and into the ocean.
                                                  D
    UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are
    FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.

    He breaks the surface and gasps for air.

    He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the
    tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried
    beneath the dark ocean water.

    EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

    A floating tenement.
    A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims
    into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its
    grip.

    EXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                   3

    The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.

    He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.

    AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over
    on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he
    DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a
    labored lobster-walk.

    He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge
    of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white
    and flaccid.

    A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to
    him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of
    scotch and begins drinking.

                                                   ISSOLVE TO:

    INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                      4

    The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.

    He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.

                                                                2.

    Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven,
    with his hair neatly trimmed.

    Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing,
    overwhelmed with mutual desire.

    He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all
    over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.

    He kisses her passionately on the mouth.

                        MAN
              Oh, my dear...

    His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She
    begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around
    her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his
    hands to the laces and together they undo it.

                        WOMAN
                  (whispering softly)
              It's all right, darling. It's all
              right.

    INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

    OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a
    pair of pants over his extended arm.

                        A VOICE (O.S.)
              Oscar! Where the devil are you?

    Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom.

                        OSCAR
              My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.

    INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

    There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black
    socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39.

    He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man
    who can have anything he wants.

    Right now... he wants his pants.

                        FRANKLIN
              I've been standing here for five minutes.

    Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a
    Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs.

                                                               3.

                        OSCAR
              Did you sleep well, sir?

                        FRANKLIN
              Don't remember. That's good, isn't it?

                          OSCAR
              Yes, sir.

    Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them,
    pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders.

    INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

    Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid
    off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours
    himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.

    He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.

                        WOMAN (O.S.)
              I could not be more delighted to have
              received your most charming letter.
              It has been far too long since we last
              corresponded. However, it is with
              great reluctance I must decline your
              kind speaking invitation...

                                                                    8
    INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

    ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous
    eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary
    intelligence and depth.

                        ELEANOR
              Unfortunately, I would be of little
              assistance to the Junior Assistance
              League. Particularly if my purpose
              were to appear as an alumna who is
              gifted at public speaking.

    She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a
    head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is
    Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.

    She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.

                        LUCY
              And what do you really want me to say?

                        ELEANOR
              Thank you and if you ask again I
              shall scream?

                                                          4.

They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely
rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.

                    LOUIS
          Why don't you ask your husband for
          some pointers? He's a pretty gifted
          public speaker, don't you think?

LOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and
unlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire --
part consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind
what he believes will be the greatest political career of the
twentieth century.

He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles
off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.

                    LOUIS
          You should get out once in a while.
          Accepting that invitation would be
          good for Franklin's career.

                    ELEANOR
          Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more
          comfortable waiting for my husband
          outside?

                    LOUIS
          In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?

                    ELEANOR
          If you like.

Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters
from the dining room.

                    FRANKLIN
          I see it's not even eight a.m.
          and already the gloves are off.
              (kissing Eleanor on the
               cheek)
          Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss
          Mercer.   L
                     UCY
          Good morning, sir.

Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.

                    LOUIS
              (annoyed)
          You're late. Honestly, why do you
          enjoy keeping people waiting?

                                                                5.

                        FRANKLIN
              Because they always seem more
              grateful to see me when I arrive.

    He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.

                        FRANKLIN
              Have a lovely day, Babs.

                        ELEANOR
              Should I expect you for dinner?

                        FRANKLIN
              I have the Navy reception this
              evening. I'll be home quite late.
              Unless you've changed your mind
              about coming?

    Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing
    furiously.

                        ELEANOR
              Do you wish me to come?

                        FRANKLIN
              Well... whatever you'd like.

                        ELEANOR
                  (a beat)
              Thank you, no.

                        FRANKLIN
              Very well then.
                  (tipping his hat)
              Good day, Miss Mercer.

    Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the
    ladies and follows him out.

    EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. SIDEWALK - DAY
9                                                                    9
    A car pulls over and Franklin is first out, followed by
    Louis, walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite
    side of the street. Louis struggles to keep up while
    consulting a small appointment book.

                        LOUIS
              At ten you've got a meeting with
              representatives from Pittsburgh
              Steel. Their bid on the ship
              building contract has already been
              turned in and is on your desk for
              approval.

                                                         6.

                    FRANKLIN
          What did I think of it?

An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb, letting Franklin
and Louis pass.

                    LOUIS
          You had some problems with it.

                    FRANKLIN
          I better read it. Steel workers
          tend to vote democratic. Next.

                    LOUIS
          Lunch with Secretary Daniels.

                    FRANKLIN
          Must I?

                    LOUIS
          He's your boss.

                    FRANKLIN
          Anything else?

                    LOUIS
              (a beat)
          What if she'd said yes?

                    FRANKLIN
          Who?

Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who."

                    LOUIS
          People know. It's time to stop.

                    FRANKLIN
          I can handle my own affairs, Louis.

                    LOUIS
          Not this one. This is Washington,
          D.C., not the Harvard Club.
              (off-put by Franklin's
               arrogance)
          How can you be so cavalier?

                    FRANKLIN
          You say that like it's a bad thing.

Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows
him inside a building.

                                                                 7.

     A large grandfather clock reads 3:00.

     The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin
     quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is
     slightly askew.

     As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness.
     They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening
     to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs.

11                                                                11
     INT. UPPER LANDING - CONTINUING

     Franklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the
     stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then
     goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her.

     INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
12                                                                12
     Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly
     so as not to wake him.

     Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then
     turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an
     open duffle bag.

     Tentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied
     with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by
     their familiar scent.

     With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down
     her cheeks as she reads.

     Franklin opens his eyes.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion. It is
     surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal
     paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River.

     THE FIVE ROOSEVELT CHILDREN are screaming on the front lawn
     playing a boisterous game of croquet.

     INT. SPRINGWOOD - DINING ROOM - DAY
14                                                                14
     SARA ROOSEVELT, 65, sits at the head of the table. She is one
     for whom the expression "Grande Dame" was coined.

                                                                 8.

     Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale.
     Louis, as always, is by his side.

     Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits
     across from them, calm and composed.

                         ELEANOR
               I have offered Franklin his freedom.

                         FRANKLIN
               And I have accepted.

                         SARA
                   (to Eleanor)
               His freedom is not yours to offer!

                         FRANKLIN
               I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama.

                         LOUIS
               Lord save us from fools in love.

                         SARA
               Falling in love is out of the
               question. Why do you think men have
               mistresses? Duty. Duty to their
               families and their careers.

     Eleanor rises from the table.

                         SARA
               Where do you think you're going?

                         ELEANOR
               It's obvious that my input in this
               matter is of little importance.

     She begins to exit the room, but Franklin is up like a shot.

                         FRANKLIN
               Babs!

                         SARA
               Come back here! Both of you!

     INT. ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS

     Franklin chases Eleanor. Midway up the stairs, she turns.
                          E
                          LEANOR
               I don't know whether to hate you
               or thank you.

                                                              9.

                           FRANKLIN
               For what?

                         ELEANOR
               For forcing me to face my life
               honestly for the first time.

                         FRANKLIN
               I didn't mean to hurt you, Babs.

                         ELEANOR
               You never do. You live your life
               skimming the surface... never aware
               of the attachments beneath.
                   (finding her anger)
               It must be a luxury.

     She goes up the stairs without looking back.

16                                                                16
     INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Franklin slowly walks back into the room.

                         SARA
               Divorce will finish your career in
               politics. How do you intend to
               support yourself?

                         FRANKLIN
               My trust fund.

                         SARA
               Divorce Eleanor and there is no
               trust fund.

     Franklin turns away. He looks out the large picture window
     and attempts to light a cigarette, but his hands shake.

                         LOUIS
               We've come so far, boss. State
               Assembly, Assistant Secretary of
               the Navy -- all pages right out of
               Cousin Teddy's play book. We're on
               the road to the White House. Don't
               do this.

     Franklin sees his son, ELLIOT, 10, playing separately from
     the rest of his siblings. Elliot looks up at his father as
     Franklin bares his best politician's smile at him.

     A ROAR begins to fill his ears. It becomes clearer that it is
     the sound of a CROWD CHEERING.

                                                                 10.

                         CROWD NOISE (O.S.)
               Rose-velt! Rose-velt! Rose-velt!

     INT. DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION HALL - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
17                                                                    17
     CONVENTIONEERS shout out Franklin's name holding up PLACARDS
     emblazoned with:

                       "COX/ROOSEVELT IN '20!"
     Franklin BOLTS, running vigorously down the center aisle of
     the hall lit by the circle of a spotlight. The CROWD goes
     wild over this unconventional entrance.
     W
      hen he reaches the edge of the stage he LEAPS onto it. This
     final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy.

     CLOSE UP - FRANKLIN
18                                                                    18
     Smiling for no one. For everyone.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (breathless)
               I humbly accept your nomination for
               Vice-President!

     The CROWD roars back in reaction to his less-than-humble stance.

                          FRANKLIN
               They say the best way to get   rid of
               a man is to have him run for   Vice-
               President.
                   (he holds for the laugh)
               You might well have asked my   cousin
               Teddy if that's how they got   rid
               of him!

     Franklin stands on the stage, the music rising, the crowd
     cheering. Slowly, the sound of the convention fades to
     something far more delicate...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. TEA ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
19                                                                    19
     A harp playing in an elegant tea room. The hushed tones of
     polite conversation wafts through the air.

     Franklin sits with his cousin, ALICE ROOSEVELT, 36, daughter
     of Teddy. Brilliant and acerbic, she would have had a career
     in politics had she been born a man.

                                                   11.

                    ALICE
          Of course you lost. A Roosevelt on
          the democratic ticket? Our ancestors
          are turning in their graves.

                    FRANKLIN
          Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive
          he'd be a democrat -- and you know it.

                    ALICE
          Rubbish. But I do know one thing:
          You're exactly like him. My father
          was born wanting only one thing: to
          be President.

                    FRANKLIN
          And what's wrong with that?

They both share a laugh.

                     ALICE
          Do you know what they're saying
          about you?

Franklin's smile fades.

                    FRANKLIN
          No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.

                    ALICE
          They say F.D.R. stands for
          "featherduster." That you're a
          lightweight. A dilettante with no
          substance; no point of view.

                    FRANKLIN
          Is that what you think?

                    ALICE
          You lead with your vanity. You
          talk when you should listen.
          Unless these are the qualities of
          a democrat?
                    F
                     RANKLIN
          The democratic party is the party
          of the people. I am a man of the
          people.

                    ALICE
          Darling, you're a Roosevelt. What
          do you know about people?

                                                             12.

     She leans in conspiratorially.

                         ALICE
               Of course, I can think of one person
               you did manage to find the time to
               invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe?

                         FRANKLIN
               Alice, stop.

                         ALICE
               Don't misunderstand me, Franklin.
               Being married to Eleanor I think
               you deserved some fun. But you made
               the right decision. Especially
               since Miss Mercer has gone on with
               her life.

                         FRANKLIN
               What are you talking about?

                         ALICE
               Edward Rutherford is a wonderful
               catch for a girl like her.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (stunned)
               She's married?

                         ALICE
               Last week. A small event, of course.

                         FRANKLIN
               When I last heard she was governess
               to his children.

                         ALICE
                   (with a smile)
               And then love bloomed. As a "man of
               the people," I wouldn't be too hard
               on her, Franklin. We can't all have
               trust funds you know.

     Franklin, Louis and a PHOTOGRAPHER disembark from a touring car.

                         LOUIS
               We're not taking this defeat lying
               down, boss. We'll run you for
               Governor --

                                                        13.

                    FRANKLIN
              (kidding)
          Really? Of which state?

Louis shoots him a look.

                    LOUIS
          Very funny. No, this buys you time.
          It buys you experience.

                    FRANKLIN
          What about Al Smith?

                    LOUIS
          He's vulnerable. You're still a
          fresh face, boss. We'll use that to
          our advantage.

They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the
PHOTOGRAPHER follows them.

                    FRANKLIN
          Boy Scouts, Louis? Hardly my
          political base.

                    LOUIS
          They've got parents. Besides
          they're photogenic.

Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly
underprivileged children.

                    FRANKLIN
          Franklin Roosevelt, happy to
          meet you.

Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an
artificial good cheer. Meanwhile, Louis, in full political
mode, makes sure the L
                     Photographer gets everything.

                        OUIS
          Over here!

Franklin poses with two Scouts. The picture is taken.

                    SCOUTMASTER
          Okay, boys, lunch. Line up to wash!
              (to Franklin)
          Will you be joining us?

                       FRANKLIN
          Of course!

                                                                14.

     Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water
     barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE, 9, an immigrant
     child of the city streets. He wears his uniform proudly and
     smiles at Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
               What's your name, son?

                           GUISEPPE
               Guiseppe.

     Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment
     between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away.

                         FRANKLIN
               Guiseppe! Come sta, ragazzo?

                         GUISEPPE
                   (puzzled)
               Okay, I guess.

     The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water
     barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly.

     As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin,
     not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras.

     A large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that
     looks out over the icy waters of the Bay of Fundy.

     EXT. PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

     Eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting -- in a
     world of her own.

     A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis,
     overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. An overflowing
     ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his
     feet.

     He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and
     the Boy Scouts.

                         LOUIS
               He's a natural.

     Eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where
     Franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn.

                                                         15.

Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing
up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses.
He doubles over, trying to catch his breath.

                    ELLIOT
          Vae victis! ("Woe to the
          conquered!")
C
 aught up in his victory, Elliot doesn't see Franklin sneak
up behind him and tackle him to the ground.

                    FRANKLIN
          Festina lente! ("Not so fast!")

One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and
Elliot.

                    ELEANOR
          Dinner is in one half-hour! Come in
          and change, children!

                    FRANKLIN
          Up! Up, chicks! You heard your
          mother!

Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except
Franklin.

                    ELEANOR
          Go wash up.

Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving.

                    LOUIS
          Hey, boss! Are you all right?

Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the
porch stairs.

                    FRANKLIN
          I'm fine.
              (re: her knitting)
          Oh, that's pretty, Babs.

He puts his hand on Eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss
her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands.

                    ELEANOR
          I must check on dinner.

There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth.

                                                              16.

                            FRANKLIN
               Very well.

     She goes into the house. Louis then hands Franklin letters.

                            LOUIS
               Tired?

                         FRANKLIN
               Of you? Never.

     Wearily, he sorts through the envelopes.

                         LOUIS
               Why don't you nap before dinner?

                            FRANKLIN
               Yes, dear.

     Franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the
     screen door struggling for control.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     Franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a DOCTOR, who
     leans over him holding out his hand.

                         DOCTOR
               Can you take my hand?

     Franklin tries, but can't. Almost his entire body is
     paralyzed. He can only breathe and blink.

     The Doctor glances at Eleanor, Louis and Sara indicating they
     should follow him out.

     As the door from the sun room opens onto the porch, Elliot is
     there waiting. Seeing them coming, he dashes off into the
     yard so as not to be seen as Eleanor, Louis, Sara and the
     Doctor enter.

                         DOCTOR
               He has Infantile Paralysis. Polio.

     Sara sinks into a chair.

          Not necessarily.

                    LOUIS
          How did he get it?

                    DOCTOR
          Some experts believe it is linked
          to contaminated water. But that
          theory is speculative at best.

                    LOUIS
          It was the visit to that god damned
          Boy Scout Camp!

                    DOCTOR
          In all honesty you need to be
          looking forward, not back.

                    ELEANOR
          What is the prognosis?

                    DR. LOVETT
          The damage to his leg muscles is
          extensive. I suspect he will be
          paralyzed from the waist down.

                     ELEANOR
          Dear God.
               beat)
          And the children?

                    DR. LOVETT
          If they don't have any symptoms by
          now then they have been spared.

Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud.

                    SARA
          Then we must count our blessings.

                     R. LOVETT
          You will need to prepare yourselves.
          There is a deep depression that
          follows an illness of this magnitude.
          I'm afraid life as he knew it is over.

Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a
child crying. Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes.

                            L




                                                               18.

     Eleanor finds Elliot, having heard everything, curled up in a
     ball, weeping. She leans down and wraps her arms around him.

     CLOSE-UP - WALLPAPER

     A pink background covered in small white flowers with red
     centers and green leaves. There is a seam in the paper. A
     tiny white spot where glue has soaked through.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed.

     This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour.

     His lips are dry.

     A glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand. He
     reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach.

     Slowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth.

     Sara, Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation.

                         SARA
               Now that politics are out of the
               question he can stay here at home
               with me.

                         ELEANOR
               But what kind of life is that?

                           OUIS
               I've rented him an office downtown.

               He can pursue a career, Mama.

               A man as proud and vital as
               Franklin... you're inviting him to

               my son... is there nothing you
               won't do to keep your job?

     Sara leaves as Eleanor goes after her.

     Sara busies herself arranging flowers.

               pitied and stared at?

               What kind of life is it to be
               hidden away? I know you believe
               that what you are suggesting for
               Franklin is best. But I think you
               are making it harder for him.

               I think I know what's best for
               Franklin. I am his mother!

                         ELEANOR
               And I am his wife.

     Sara stares at Eleanor in disbelief. Eleanor stares back --
     unflinching.

     Franklin reaches his arm towards the glass only to fall from
     the bed to the floor with a thud. Frustrated beyond words,
     Franklin lunges at his wheelchair and shoves it across the
     floor letting out an anguished cry.

     In agony, from both the pain and the humiliation, he stares
     up and fixes his gaze on the ornate ceiling overhead.

     Then, closing his eyes, a POUNDING in his head starts to get
     louder and louder --

                                                       CUT TO:

                                                               20.

     Franklin, on his back, his face and body drenched with sweat,
     is asleep in his bunk in the boat. He awakens to the sound of
     the POUNDING. Voices are calling him accompanied by FISTS
     smashing at the door. He opens his eyes and is disoriented.
     He tries to sit up -- momentarily forgetting that he can't.
     H
      e lifts the sheet and visibly WINCES in disgust at the sight
     of his crippled legs. BONES covered by FLESH with barely an
     ounce of muscle.

     Finally the door BURSTS open.   Two young crewman, EUGENE and
     STANLEY enter.

                         EUGENE
               Mr. Roosevelt, we got a storm
               comin'!

     He lifts Franklin over his shoulder. Stanley grabs clothes and
     pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall.

     Eugene grabs a bucket and holds Franklin up to urinate.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (while peeing)
               Leave me here. Let the ocean
               swallow me up. Burial at sea.
               Perfect for a navy man.

     Stripped to his underwear Franklin is laid across the bunk.
     Eugene kneels and puts on Franklin's socks and shoes. Then he
     and Stanley slide on his braces and pants.

     Their hands zipper, clasp, buckle and tie. Each hand works in
     synchronicity with the other.

     Clumsily they lift Franklin up, struggling under his weight.

     Kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people,
     mostly fishermen, seeking refuge from the coming storm.
     Franklin, soaked-to-the-skin and wrapped in a blanket, is
     being pushed through the door by Eugene in a wheelchair.

     The restaurant collectively pauses to take them.

                                                        21.

Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant. He shrinks
from the stares of the patrons.

A LITTLE GIRL eating with her parents gets excited when she
sees Franklin's braces and points. Franklin gives her a hard
look and she is hurt.

What he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of
braces like his.

Franklin is wheeled up to his table and EUGENE and STANLEY sit
down with him.

Louis enters resembling a drowned rat. He rips off his hat
and raincoat and puts down his suitcase.

                    FRANKLIN
              (genuinely surprised)
          Louis?

                    LOUIS
          I never miss Florida in the rainy
          season.

                    FRANKLIN
          No letter? No wire?

                    LOUIS
          Why? Would you have answered it?

                    FRANKLIN
          What the hell are you doing here?

                    LOUIS
          Good to see you too. Nice whiskers.
          You look like Chester Arthur.

                     FRANKLIN
          Stanley, this is Mr. Howe. He gets
          sea-sick at the mere sight of a
          boat so he's probably happy that
          it's being Ldestroyed right now.

                     OUIS
          Boys, I need to talk to Mr. Roosevelt
          alone. Find your own breakfast. Here's
          a five spot. Make it a feast.

They look at the money and take their leave.

                    FRANKLIN
          You're always so generous with my
          money.

                                                          22.

                    LOUIS
          You mean your mother's, don't you?

The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee. Franklin pulls out
a flask and pours some into his cup. He then lights a
cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to Louis.
Without asking, Louis helps himself.

                     FRANKLIN
          So Mama financed this fool's
          errand, has she? Well, it's a waste
          of a trip.

                    LOUIS
          It was Eleanor's idea.

Franklin's face is immobile.

                    WAITRESS
          What can I get you?

                    LOUIS
          I'd like some ham and eggs, sunny
          side up, please?
              (to Franklin)
          What's your fancy, boss?

                    FRANKLIN
          Nothing. I fancy nothing.

                    LOUIS
          He'll have the same.

The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. Louis opens
his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin
glances it, but doesn't open any.

                    LOUIS
          There are a few from your children.

                    FRANKLIN
          I can still read.

Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that
interests him, opening it.

                    LOUIS
          Your wife wants you to come home.
              (choosing his words)

          they're aching to see you.

          Really?

Louis looks sadly at his friend.

                    LOUIS
          What's that?

               skimming the letter)
          From George Foster Peabody. He owns
          a resort in rural Georgia for
          investment purposes. Hot springs or
          something. He claims that only
          recently a crippled boy swam in the
          waters and can walk again.

                    LOUIS
          Oh, for Chrissake...

                    FRANKLIN
              (reading)
          "
           The high magnesium content of
          these natural springs will hold
          anyone up. Although it is not a
          resort for infirm types I am
          extending you my personal
          invitation to come visit in the off-
          season."
              (putting the letter aside)
          I'm only welcome in the "off-
          season."

Eugene and Stanley approach the table.

                    EUGENE
          Mr. Roosevelt, we got bad news.

                    FRANKLIN
          What?

                    STANLEY
          It's the boat... it got banged up
          real bad tied to the dock.

                      RANKLIN
          How bad?

                    STANLEY
          I don't think you can stay there
          anymore.

 ranklin absorbs this.

                    EUGENE
          Maybe it's a blessing in disguise,
          Mr. Roosevelt. I don't know about
          you, but I'm homesick.

                    FRANKLIN
          And I'm sick of home.
              (to Louis)
          Where's the letter from Peabody?

                    LOUIS
          You can't be serious?

He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it.

                    FRANKLIN
          Why not miracle waters? I've drunk
          the oil of monkey glands, been
          zapped with electricity and hung
          upside down in harnesses. After all
          that, this sounds downright
          peaceful.

                    LOUIS
          I can't quite picture you in the
          back woods of Georgia.

                    FRANKLIN
          Where do you picture me, Louis?

                    LOUIS
          1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

                    FRANKLIN
          President, Louis? I can't visit the
          bathroom without a team of
          associates to help pull my pants
          down.

                         LOUIS
               Give it a little time.

                          RANKLIN
               There's a reason they say a man
               runs for office.
                   (a beat)
               I'm going to Georgia.

     Franklin and Eleanor sit next to one another. Franklin is now
     shaved and cleaned up considerably.

     However, the tension between them is palpable. Eleanor knits
     furiously while talking. Franklin looks out the window at
     African-American FIELD HANDS hard at work in the red clay
     hills of Georgia.

                         ELEANOR
               James has been doing so much better
               now that Elliot has joined him at
               Groton. They've put their
               differences behind them and have
               become a real team.

     Franklin observes two YOUNG BOYS, African-American, running
     alongside the slow-moving train.

                          ELEANOR
               Two peas in a pod. Last week they
               were both in the infirmary with the
     F         same cold.

      ranklin eyes a wagon pulled by a mule. The driver, a FARMER,
     takes off his hat and wipes his brow in the hot sun.

                          LEANOR
               Meanwhile, any suggestion I make to
               Anna for her future -- she
               dismisses me. I am going to have to
               enlist your support in this,
               Franklin. She listens to you.

     She looks over at Franklin and sees that he is staring out the
     window, deep in thought -- not having heard a word she's said.

                                                              26.

     EXT. BULLOCHVILLE TRAIN STATION - GEORGIA - DAY
35                                                              35
     TOM LOYLESS, 39, stands waiting by a car dressed in a white
     suit. Laconic, with a dry sense of humor, Tom is a man of few
     words whose poker face hides a true desperation. He holds a
     telegram from Franklin in his hand.

     As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the
     passengers making their exit.

     There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked
     WHITE and COLORED. Whites exit from the front of the train
     and Blacks from the rear.

     LIONEL PURDY, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform,
     approaches Tom. Of indeterminate age and dubious intellect,
     his mail bag is almost as big as he is.

                         LIONEL
               Someone important?

                         TOM
               You might say so, Lionel.

                         LIONEL
               Who?

                         TOM
               A Mr. Roosevelt.

                         LIONEL
               Teddy?

                         TOM
                   (patiently)
               No, he's dead.

                         LIONEL
               Oh.

     The STATIONMASTER approaches.

                         STATIONMASTER
               Tom, your guest needs some
               assistance. We're gonna need some
               able-bodied men to move him.

                         TOM
                   (to Lionel)
               Go over to the livery stable...

                         LIONEL
               ... and get the Collier boys.

                                                               27.

     Franklin exits the train slung in a fireman's carry over the
     shoulder of ROY COLLIER, African-American, 29. His brother
     PETE, 27, is close behind, carrying luggage -- both hover at
     around 6' 4".

     Tom approaches. Franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment
     with good cheer.

                         FRANKLIN
               Hello! Hello! Mr. Loyless?

                         TOM
               Tom, Mr. Roosevelt.

                         FRANKLIN
               Then you'd better call me Franklin.

     Still in the fireman's carry, Franklin extends his hand for
     Tom to shake.

                           TOM
               Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
               And this is the Misses.

                         ELEANOR
               Call me Eleanor.

                         TOM
               Pleased to make your acquaintance.

     Roy then carries him over to Tom's car and gingerly places
     him inside. Pete follows.

                         ROY
                   (to Tom)
               There's a trunk and a chair with
               the wheels, too.

                         TOM
               I'll send a wagon right over.

                         PETE
               We got a wagon, sir.

     EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

     Tom drives Franklin in front, Eleanor sits in the back.

                                                             28.

     Pine trees tower over the sides of the dirt road. In
     occasional clearings, Franklin spies barefoot children
     playing out in front of broken-down shacks. They stop their
     play to look at the car.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (covering his discomfort)
               Beautiful country.

                         ELEANOR
               How long have you been manager of
               the Inn?

                           TOM
               Not long.

     They BANG over a large pothole. They all fly up and land hard.

                         FRANKLIN
               Got any paved roads?

                         TOM
               No we don't.

     EXT. THE MERIWETHER INN - DAY

     Tom's car turns into a driveway. Franklin has a brochure for
     "The Meriwether Inn" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the
     building through the trees but cannot.

     He looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish
     Victorian Hotel and the words, "Our renowned mineral hot
     springs can cure whatever ails you!"

     Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and
     yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is
     peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown
     with weeds.

     The car pulls to a stop.

                         TOM
               You'll have a great deal of
               privacy. There are only a few
               guests right now as it's the off-
               season... I'm hoping to make some
               improvements by next Spring --

     Franklin puts out his arm preventing Tom from getting out of
     the car.

                           F




                                                                29.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (panicked)
               I... I can't stay here. This place
               is a wreck.
                         E
                            LEANOR
               Franklin!

                         TOM
               Look on the bright side. Most of
               your time will be spent in the
               water.
                   (a beat)
               It's true, we've fallen on some
               hard times...

                          RANKLIN
               Hard times? This is a disaster! It
               should be condemned!

     Tom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he
     stays remarkably calm.

                         TOM
               Yes, we've seen better days.
                   (a beat)
               But then I imagine so have you.

     Franklin blinks incomprehensibly at Tom and what he has just
     said.

                         TOM
               I'm happy to drive you back to the
               train station right now, if that's
               what you want.

     They lock eyes. Franklin wonders if Tom's bluffing, but he
     can't tell.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (in a low voice)
               Fire. I'm frightened of fire. I
               can't get out if I'm upstairs.

                         TOM
               We've got options.

     Tom's car is now parked in front of a group of small
     cottages. Roy and Pete's horse drawn wagon is behind it.

                                                               30.

     Tom and Pete open a set of shutters over the windows of a
     tiny cottage.

     Franklin and Eleanor sit in the car, watching.

     Sheets cover the furniture, cobwebs span the beams and dust
     particles fill the air.

     As Tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door,
     Franklin notices a broken window.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (caustic)
               Well ventilated, at least.

     Roy enters with a suitcase.

                          ROY
               Where do you want this, Mr.
               Roosevelt?

                         FRANKLIN
               The bedroom, Roy, thank you.

     He looks after Roy as he exits.

                         FRANKLIN
               Tom, this young man appears quite
               competent. Would you ask him if
               he'd like to stay on as my valet?

                         TOM
                   (politely)
               Why don't you ask him yourself?

     He tips his hat and goes outside.

     Eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned
     by the squalor. She speaks to Franklin who is changing in the
     other room.

                           T




                                                             31.

                         ELEANOR
               This is madness.

                           FRANKLIN (O.S.)
               No doubt.

                         ELEANOR
               Tell me again, Franklin, why are we
               here?

     Franklin is wheeled out by Roy, now changed into a bathing
     suit.

                         FRANKLIN
               For the waters. Are you coming?

     Roy wheels Franklin while Tom walks in front of them leading
     the way.

                          OM
               Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim?

                         FRANKLIN
               Mrs. Roosevelt doesn't know how.

     Franklin takes in the surroundings. Deserted horse stables in
     total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the
     landscape.

45                                                                45
     EXT. POOL - DAY

     An immense, T-shaped pool rimmed in concrete. The bluish
     water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out
     of the warmth.
     A
       MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair,
     comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her CHILDREN out of
     the water.

     AUNT SALLY, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands
     guard by the edge of the water.

                         TOM
               Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet
               Aunt Sally.

                         FRANKLIN
               Aunt Sally.

                         AUNT SALLY
               Good day, sir. I have towels for you.

                                                                32.

     Roy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as
     possible. Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy HOIST
     Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting
     his feet dangle in the warm water.

     Twisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously.

                         TOM
               Now give it a minute. You'll see
               that the mineralization makes the
               water more buoyant. The crippled
               boy who swam here was actually able
               to walk in the water.

     Franklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow
     bottom. Crushed, all hope drains from his face.

                         FRANKLIN
               I can't even stand.

                         AUNT SALLY
               Well, not yet.

     A handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room.
     Franklin and Eleanor sit together. He is eating heartily, but
     Eleanor merely moves her food around.

                         ELEANOR
               This is simply revolting.

                         FRANKLIN
               It's not very good, but it is
               mysterious.
                   (holding out his plate)
               What in the world do you think
               they've poured over this chicken?
               Or is it possum?

     Eleanor sizes Franklin up. She knows this is a preamble.

          You want to stay.

          Yes.

                     RANKLIN
          I need something new.

                    ELEANOR
          This isn't about getting better is
          it? You don't want to come home.
          You don't want to live with us.

                    FRANKLIN
          I refuse to be a burden to anyone.

                    ELEANOR
          You're not a burden, you're my
          husband.

 e reaches out and takes her hand in his.

                    FRANKLIN
          I want to offer you the freedom you
          once so generously offered me.
              (she pulls it away)
          All you've ever known is duty. To
          me and to a political career that
          unless I can walk no longer exists.
          You've been exemplary. Now I'm
          telling you you're free to go.

                       ELEANOR
                 (her voice rising)
          No.
              (a beat)
          I don't want freedom. I want a
          marriage. I want a life with you.

Franklin won't let himself believe it.

                    FRANKLIN
          I can't imagine what you think that
          life is going to be.

This takes the wind out of Eleanor.

                                                             34.

                            ELEANOR
                  Oh Franklin... it's not up to me to
                  imagine, it's up to you.

     Eleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table.

     Pete helps Eleanor into his livery wagon.

     Franklin watches from the porch as Eleanor rides away. Her
     suitcase slides across the open wagon bed, as the wagon makes
     the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road.

     Looking out -- straight ahead.

     Alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight.

                  Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Howe.

                            LOUIS
                  I thought you might want to see a
                  friendly face.
                     (off the silence)
                  So how's our boy doing?

                            ELEANOR
                  Well, he's enjoying the waters very
                  much. He...
                      (suddenly overwhelmed)
                  I think we've lost him.

     Her pent-up tears burst in a free-flow. Louis leads her to a
     nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief.

                  Don't you think it's time you
                  called me Louis?

                         LOUIS
               Maybe we've been going about this
               all wrong. He's down there to be
               alone so let's give him what he
               wants. We change our focus.

                           LEANOR
               To what?

     Louis smiles, knowingly.

     EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

     Franklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair. His
     cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass
     milk bottle. He pours one for Tom, then himself.

                         FRANKLIN
               To your mineral pool, or whatever
               you call it.

                         TOM
               Warm Springs.

     They clink their glasses. Tom takes a polite sip, then chokes
     back the bad taste.

                         FRANKLIN
               Too strong?

                         TOM
               Haven't been in a drinking mood lately.

                          FRANKLIN
               I have.

                         TOM
               Actually, its the most god-awful
               martini I've ever tasted.

                         FRANKLIN
               Are you always this direct, Tom?

                                                              36.

                         TOM
               Well, I never tasted a martini this
               bad before.

     Franklin takes another sip, checking. It tastes fine to him.

                          FRANKLIN
                   (hurt)
               Everyone likes my martinis...

     Aunt Sally is seated, talking with Roy while Franklin lies on
     his back in the water, swimming. All his movement comes from
     his shoulders and arms. The morning sun streams down on him.

     Tom sits off to one side reading the newspaper.

                         FRANKLIN
               Tell me more about what that boy
               did, Aunt Sally.

                         AUNT SALLY
               Well, first he'd always swim over
               to the side of the pool and hold
               himself there -- make sure he
               righted himself. Then... before he
               knew it... he'd be standing.

                         FRANKLIN
               If it was only that easy.

                         AUNT SALLY
               Well, you make it hard. Get over to
               the side of that pool and grab it.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (
                    humoring her)
               Yes, ma'am.

                         AUNT SALLY
               Now you got to remember how you did
               it.

     Franklin holds the edge of the pool, closing his eyes.

     For a long moment there is silence. Almost without realizing
     it, Franklin lets go of the edge of the pool.

     When he opens his eyes -- he is standing -- all by himself in
     the water.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (a nervous laugh)
               I'm standing.

     His laughter gets stronger. Tom, Aunt Sally and Roy look on.

                         FRANKLIN
               I'm standing.

     The release is powerful as Franklin dissolves into tears.

     Tom, who's been mixing cocktails, hands Franklin a drink and
     lifts his glass.

                         TOM
               To standing on your own two feet!

     They clink and drink.

                          RANKLIN
               This water could be the cure -- the
               cure! In six months I could be up
               and walking!

     Lionel, the mailman, comes down the path carrying a
     flashlight, reading an open letter.

          Not for me it isn't. Got a whole
          packet of clippings for you, Mr.
          Roosevelt. From a Mr. Howe. New
          York Times, Journal-American...
          don't know what else.

He hands an already opened letter to Franklin.

                    LIONEL
          Your mother wants to know when
          you're coming home. She says they
          got swimming pools in Hyde Park.
          She's mad as all hell.

                    FRANKLIN
          Reading other people's mail is not
          only impolite, it's illegal.

                    LIONEL
          Sheriff don't mind. He likes I read
          his mail. Saves him the time. Plus
          a lot of folks around here can't
          read, so it's more a public
          service, really.

                    FRANKLIN
          Astonishing. Thank you, Lionel.

He hands Lionel a letter.

Lionel reaches into his bag.

          Almost forgot... your wife wrote
          the nicest letter. She's gonna make
          a speech at the League of Women
          Voters.

     reading.

               name alive. Least till he starts
               walkin' and all.

     Lionel takes the letter Franklin just handed him, opens it,
     flicks his flashlight back on and continues on his way.

          Too often...

She stops. The pause is deadly. Louis looks ready to jump out
a window. Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high.

                    ELEANOR
          Too often the great decisions are
          originated and given form in bodies
          made up wholly of men...

Slowly, she begins to find her voice.

                     ELEANOR
          So that whatever political value
          women have to offer is shunted
          aside... without expression.
          T
            his is a mistake.

She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience...
and for the first time speaks spontaneously.

                    ELEANOR
          I think this might be the reason I
          am having such a difficult time
          giving voice to my own thoughts
          here today.

The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room.

                    ELEANOR
          I'm reminded of what someone once
          said about looking at an elephant.
          That it is impossible to ever see
          an entire elephant from one place --
          you must walk around it. If our
          elected leaders are to be truly
          effective then they must be willing
          to go out of their way to look
          beyond what is right in front of
          them. To see the entire elephant.
          And for that... they need our help.

The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams.

LATER

At a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the
Chairwoman are drinking tea.

                            F




                                                             41.

                         CHAIRWOMAN
               That was so moving, Mrs. Roosevelt.
               The Child Welfare Amendment could
               use someone with your passion. You
               must consider being our
               spokesperson.

     Eleanor looks to Louis who nods.

                         ELEANOR
               Oh. It would be an honor.

                            CHAIRWOMAN
               Wonderful.

     EXT. POOL - DAY

     Franklin is attempting to walk in the water, working
     diligently. Tom watches him from a few paces back.

                            TOM
               Morning.

                         FRANKLIN
               I walked five steps today!

                         TOM
               Congratulations. Listen, Franklin,
               I got word a local reporter wants
               to do a story on you.

                          RANKLIN
               I'm hardly newsworthy these days.
                   (a beat)
               How did he find out I'm here?

                         TOM
               Small town -- word gets out. It
               probably won't amount to more than
               a provincial puff piece but it
               might give us some free publicity
               for the Inn.

     Franklin looks at Tom knowing full well he's arranged this.

                         TOM
               All right, I know the gentleman.
               I'm doing him a favor. You know, I
               used to be a journalist.

                         FRANKLIN
               Do you mean all this time I've been
               talking to a newspaper man?

                                                             42.

                         TOM
               Not anymore. I got in a bit of
               trouble in Atlanta. Seems some of
               the editorial pieces I wrote
               offended the sensibilities of a
               local civic group. So I needed to
               lay low for a while.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (a beat)
               You mean the Klan? Good God, Tom...
                         T
                          OM
               Thankfully, Mr. George Foster
               Peabody gave me this job...

                         FRANKLIN
               Well, that explains a few things.
               For the life of me, I couldn't
               figure out why someone like you was
               running this --

                           TOM
               Rat-trap?

                         FRANKLIN
                   (laughing, swimming off)
               I was going to say dump, but rat-
               trap fits nicely.

     Franklin is seated -- but not in his wheelchair. He wears
     long pants even though it's blisteringly hot.

     CLEBURNE GREGORY, 28, sits across from Franklin -- a second
     string reporter in a three-piece suit.

                         GREGORY
               Now in 1920 when you were running
               for Vice-President...

                         FRANKLIN
               I can't imagine your readers are
               interested in ancient history. Cox
               and I lost the election by a wide
               margin.

                         GREGORY
               It was only a few years ago, Mr.
               Roosevelt...

     H




                                                             43.

                         FRANKLIN
               Now it's the waters extra minerals
               plus its warmth that makes all the
               difference. At 90 degrees I can
               work my muscles for hours and not
               get cold.

                         GREGORY
               As Assistant Secretary of the Navy
               during the Great War did you
               condone the use of...

                         FRANKLIN
               I forgot one more thing you will
               need to write down. Poor
               circulation is a chronic problem
               for people in my condition.

     Gregory looks at Franklin. It's clear he's not going to get
     the interview he came for.

                         GREGORY
               So... you think it could be a cure?

                         FRANKLIN
               I don't know.

                         GREGORY
               But you're hopeful?

                            FRANKLIN
               Yes. I am.

     Franklin is laid out on the bed as Roy slides the braces off
     his legs. Roy unlaces his shoes and slips them off his feet.

      e is about to put them under the bed when Franklin motions
     for Roy to hand them to him.

     Still flat on his back, Franklin luxuriates in the rich
     leather cobbled by hand. He examines their smooth, immaculate
     soles... worn but never walked in.

     A newspaper clipping of Eleanor in her speech to the League
     is taped to the wall.

     We hear the sound of an Underwood typewriter clacking away
     and Franklin's voice, dictating.

                                                        44.

                    FRANKLIN
          Therefore, a formal questionnaire
          should be composed in order so we
          may hear from all recent delegates
          as to how we can do better in '28 to
          present a more united front. Signed,
          Franklin Roosevelt, etc., etc.

MISSY LE HAND, 30, is sitting at a card table, typing.
Brunette with some early gray, she is sturdy in build with a
plain but friendly face.

                    MISSY
          Very good. Do you want this out
          today?    F
                     RANKLIN
          Tomorrow will be fine.

                     MISSY
          Alright.

                    FRANKLIN
          Thank you, Missy, and c.c. that to
          Louis.

Missy rises with a stack of envelopes and heads out.

Roy enters with a plate of pancakes in front of Franklin.

                    ROY
          Hungry, Mr. Roosevelt?

                    FRANKLIN
          Not really.

                    ROY
          Who do you write to every morning?

                    FRANKLIN
          Different people I knew in
          politics. Just in case they ever
          want me back.

                    ROY
          So you'll be ready when you get
          your legs workin' again?

                     FRANKLIN
          Exactly.

                                                        45.

There is a knock at the screen door. An earnest young man,
BENJAMIN PRENDERGAST, 18, is peering in. He has a newspaper.

                    PRENDERGAST
          Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt?

                    FRANKLIN
          Yes. Who are you?

Roy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters.

                    PRENDERGAST
          My name is Benjamin Prendergast.
          I've come to see if you could speak
          at this year's graduation ceremony
          at the schoolhouse. You being so
          famous and all.

Prendergast unfolds the newspaper. There is a picture of
Franklin under the heading "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY
TO HEALTH!"

                    FRANKLIN
          I'll be damned.

                    PRENDERGAST
          Would you be available?

                    FRANKLIN
              (looking up)
          When? Next spring?

                    PRENDERGAST
          Next week. We only have a four
          month school year.

                    FRANKLIN
          How is that possible?

                    PRENDERGAST
          Tax dollars only cover that much.

                    FRANKLIN
          Are you graduating?

                    PRENDERGAST
          No, sir. I'm the principal.

                    FRANKLIN
          I see.

But Franklin doesn't see.

                                                                46.

     A bookshelf with four books.

     A few FARMERS and their WIVES sit with large groups of filthy
     children. They look at Franklin askance.

     Prendergast stands proudly beside three GRADUATES-TO-BE.

     Tom stands in the back observing.

     Franklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the
     gathering. He notices a FATHER staring at his legs.

                          PRENDERGAST
               Now that we're all here let me
               introduce to you to our guest
               speaker today, Mr. Franklin
               Roosevelt.

                         FRANKLIN
               Good afternoon.

     A fly begins buzzing around his head. He laughs derisively,
     almost to himself.

                         FRANKLIN
               At Groton, where I graduated from
               high school, our beloved Headmaster
               encouraged his students to enter
               public life...

     He looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished
     child which unsettles him.

                         FRANKLIN
               I chose to attend Harvard for my
               undergraduate work and then
               Columbia for my law degree.
     H
      e takes in their uncomprehending expressions.

                         FRANKLIN
               I followed my Headmaster's advice
               and sought a career in public life.
               But circumstances beyond my control
               have made that... very difficult...

                                                             47.

     He stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something
     about circumstances beyond their control.

                         FRANKLIN
               I've given many speeches in my
               life... I don't know why I'm having
               such a hard time making this one...

     Horrified and unable to speak, Franklin seems temporarily
     lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice. They just
     see Franklin.

 5                                                                65
     INT. TOM'S AUTOMOBILE - DAY

                         FRANKLIN
               My God did you see how they were
               looking at me?

                         TOM
               They welcomed your company, Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
               Don't patronize me.

     Tom is losing his patience.

                         TOM
               Don't patronize them. These people
               go to bed night after night with
               half-empty stomachs -- your legs
               are the least of their worries.

     They continue to drive in silence.

     EXT. POOL - DAY

     It's a cold day and Franklin is swimming in the pool.

     Roy is wearing a sweater. Aunt Sally is there, too, wearing a
     patched up coat with a scarf around her neck. Tom is nearby
     raking leaves.

                         AUNT SALLY
               Mr. Roosevelt, aren't you cold?

                          OY
               Mr. Roosevelt, you're gonna catch
               the chill if you don't get out of
               the water.

     Franklin ignores them and dips under the water as Tom comes
     over.

                                                             48.

                         AUNT SALLY
               You got to tell him, Mr. Loyless.
               He won't listen to us.

     Franklin comes up from under.

                         TOM
               Franklin, we need to talk...
               Normally we close up this time of
               year and the staff goes home for
               the holidays.

     Franklin looks at Tom, then at Roy and Aunt Sally,
     acknowledging.

     The sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE is heard.

     INT. HYDE PARK, NEW YORK- LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The WHISTLE is coming from a MODEL TRAIN as it zooms around a
     track set up on a table in the Roosevelt living room. Elliot,
     now 15, is mesmerized.

     Sara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN, JR., 9, and JOHN, 7.
     They are finishing a rousing rendition of "Angels We Have
     Heard on High" as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated.

     JAMES, 18, is at the top of a ladder while his sister, ANNA,

               Father?

                         FRANKLIN
               No, Elliot. Just your grandmama.

                         SARA
               I adored China. It smelled of
               ginger cookies.

                                                                49.

                         FRANKLIN, JR.
                et's go in the backyard and dig
               our way there!

                         SARA
               That sounds like an adventure.

     Anna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her
     eye. She quickly looks away.

     From behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and
     places it on his father's knee.

                         JOHN
               Put it on top.

     Silence descends over the room. No one dares to breathe.

                         ELEANOR
               Give it to James. He's the tallest.

                          JOHN
               No.

                         ANNA
               John, give it to him!

                         JOHN
               Papa always does it.

                         FRANKLIN
               I can do it.

     Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top. It
     almost catches, but it falls to the floor.

     Quickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James
     climbs back up and puts the star on top. Sara sensing the
     awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly
     cheery rendition of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."

     Roy is spotting Franklin as he pulls himself along a set of
     parallel bars. Eleanor observes as Franklin uses his arms to
     drag his legs behind him.

                         ELEANOR
               It was an extraordinary turnout
               this afternoon. Louis says there
               were over two hundred people in the
               audience.

                                                               50.



                         FRANKLIN
               That's marvelous, Babs.

     Eleanor is flushed with pride. Franklin, catching her look,
     slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him.

                         ROY
               I've got you, sir.

     Franklin then takes note that Eleanor's expression has turned
     to one of pure heartbreak.

                         FRANKLIN
               You wonder why I want to go back to
               Georgia... it's to avoid people who
               look at me the way you just did.

                         ELEANOR
               You truly believe the waters...
                   (with difficulty)
               ... that they are helping?

                         FRANKLIN
               Don't talk to me as if I were a
               child. Choosing your words so
               carefully...

                         ELEANOR
               How am I supposed to talk to you?

                         FRANKLIN
               Like I was! Talk to me like I was!

     Roy turns Franklin around on the bars and they begin walking
     away from Eleanor.

                         ELEANOR
               I don't know how anymore.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

     Franklin is being lifted out of Pete's wagon by Roy and
     placed into his wheelchair. He sees Tom approaching.
                          T
                          OM
               You're a sight for sore eyes...

                         FRANKLIN
               We missed you at the station...

                                                                51.

     The smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he
     takes in Tom's changed appearance. His face is sallow and his
     trademark white suit is hanging on him.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (concerned)
               Tom, are you all right?

                         TOM
               It's just an ulcer. I can't eat
               anything I like anymore.

     Roy carries the luggage into the cottage.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (covering)
               My father had ulcers. Damn irritating.

                         TOM
               Yes, they are.

     A silence hangs in the air.

                         TOM
               Ready to swim?

     EXT. POOL - DAY
70                                                                70
     Franklin now dressed in his bathing suit is being wheeled by
     Roy. Tom follows.

                         TOM
               We've got some new guests. Some
               paying, some non-paying...

     As they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees --

     A DOZEN PEOPLE -- all in different groupings -- some on
     crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the
     pool.

                         FRANKLIN
               What in blazes?...

                         TOM
               The interview you gave was
               syndicated in Sunday papers all
               over the country.

     Franklin looks up at Tom, dumbfounded.

                         TOM
               They're here to see you.

     This news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer.

     PAT DOYLE, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge
     cigar between his fat lips.

      is eyebrows have a life of their own. He wheels himself to
     Franklin.

                         PAT
               Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I've come
               all the way from Minneapolis to
               shake your hand, sir.

     He reaches out his hand to Franklin.

                         PAT
               Stuck in this chair I do nothing
               but read. Newspapers, mostly.
               Usually I'm just looking for
               something -- anything -- that'll
               tell me there's even the slightest
               chance I'll walk again.

     Franklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of
     his hand.

                         FRANKLIN
               I really don't know what to say.

                          PAT
               Well, you're here. And we're here.
               Together... we'll think of
               something.

     Franklin looks to Tom and gestures for him to come closer.

                         FRANKLIN
                   (whispering)
               Get me out of here.

     Franklin is pushing the chair himself along the dirt path,
     his anger propelling F
                          him away from Tom.

                          RANKLIN
               I want no part of this. I come here
               for privacy!

                         TOM
               This isn't your personal spa!
               I have a business to run.

                                                          53.

                    FRANKLIN
          Exactly. You have a business to
          run, not I!

                    TOM
          No one's asking anything of you!

                    FRANKLIN
          Of course they are!

                    TOM
          Do you know what it took for most
          of them to get here?

                    FRANKLIN
          It's not my concern. I want to be
          left alone!

                    TOM
          My God, you're afraid of these people.

                    FRANKLIN
          Afraid? What you're talking about?

                    TOM
          You look at them with the same
          repulsion and pity as everyone else.

                    FRANKLIN
          Don't be ridiculous. I resent your
          trying to --

                    TOM
          You don't want to be around them
          because then that would make you
          one of them, wouldn't it?

Franklin furiously wheels himself back towards the cottage,
getting stuck on the dirt path along the way.

                    FRANKLIN
          God damn it!

Tom comes to his aid but he is brushed off by Franklin.

                    FRANKLIN
          Out of my way! Get out of my
          goddamn way!

Franklin wheels himself off.

                                                             54.

     Franklin, in his wheelchair, smokes a cigarette. His bags are
     next to him, as is Roy. A train's whistle BLOWS and pulls in.

                         ROY
               Right on time.

     Franklin sees someone else on the platform. He squints in the
     distance. It's Tom.

     He walks closer towards Franklin and Roy.

                         TOM
               Good evening.

     Franklin nods in Tom's general direction. Tom has a telegram
     in his hand which peaks Franklin's curiosity.

                         FRANKLIN
               Expecting someone?

                         TOM
               Yes.

     The train comes to a complete stop. A CONDUCTOR steps out
     onto the platform. A single ELDERLY WOMAN gets off the train.

                         TOM
                   (to the Conductor)
               I'm looking for a young gentleman
               by the name of Botts. Fred Botts?

                         CONDUCTOR
               Don't know anything about that.

                         TOM
               I expect he would be in a
               wheelchair.

                         CONDUCTOR
               You mean the cripple? He's in the
               baggage car.

     Tom, Franklin and Roy are in front of the large door as the
     Conductor pushes it back slowly.

                                                               55.

     Amongst crates and luggage is FRED BOTTS, a young man of
     fifteen lying on the floor, unconscious. A wheelchair is next
     to him, turned over on its side.

                         FRANKLIN
               Mother of God.

     Tom leaps up and into the car as does Roy leaving Franklin
     below. Tom takes his wrist.

                         TOM
               His pulse is slow.

75                                                                75
     EXT. STATION PLATFORM - DAY

     Roy lays Fred on a bench. Franklin wheels himself over.

                         FRANKLIN
               Son, can you hear me?

     Tom brings a cup of water. Franklin puts it to Fred's lips.

                            FRANKLIN
               Fred?

     Fred opens his eyes. They are large and brown with a
     sweetness to them. His face comes alive when he recognizes
     Franklin.

                         FRED
               Mr. Roosevelt?...

                         FRANKLIN
               It's going to be all right, son.
     H
      e hands Franklin a worn newspaper clipping from his pocket.
     The headline reads: "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!"

                         FRED
               The conductor wouldn't let me ride
               in the passenger car with my chair.

     Franklin looks at the clipping, then at Fred.

                         FRANKLIN
               When did you last eat?

                            FRED
               Knoxville.

                                                        56.

                    TOM
          Knoxville had to be three days ago.

                    FRANKLIN
          Roy, take him to the car.

As Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the
engine car. Tom follows as they approach the CONDUCTOR.

                    FRANKLIN
          Who in their right mind let's a
          child ride in the baggage car!
          You could have killed that boy.

                    CONDUCTOR
          He had polio. Probably still
          contagious.

The Conductor walks away, dismissively. Franklin pushes his
chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks.

                    FRANKLIN
          Don't dismiss me because I sit in
          this chair!

                    CONDUCTOR
          Get away from me.

Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he
knocks the Conductor over.

                    FRANKLIN
          You ignorant son of a bitch. If I
          could, I'd get up right now and
          lock you in that box car! See how
          you like it!

                    TOM
          Franklin...

The Conductor struggles to get up.

                    CONDUCTOR
          Get this lunatic off me!

Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now
lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all
anger from Franklin's face.

                    FRANKLIN
          Where's the nearest hospital?

                                                               57.

                         TOM
               Closer, but not by much.

     The train whistle BLOWS.

                         ROY
               Train's ready.

     Franklin looks at Fred, then at Roy and Tom.

                         FRANKLIN

     Fred lays in Franklin's bed while Franklin sits by the
     bedside. Roy lays a cold compress on Fred's forehead.
     F

     Franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of
     him. Tom stands before him, shifting uncomfortably.

                         FRANKLIN
               How many can pay?

                         TOM
               Fewer than half.

     Franklin opens the check book and begins writing.

                         FRANKLIN
               I want these people in the
               cottages, not in the inn. It's
               safer.

                         TOM
               Well, it's the way it has to be.

                                                          58.

                    FRANKLIN
          What do you mean?

                    TOM
          I've already had some complaints.
              (awkwardly)
          This is the start of the season,
          Franklin. I've got regulars who
          have come for years. Healthy folks
          over all... They're threatening to
          check out, afraid they might catch
          polio.

                    FRANKLIN
          Such ignorance! Don't they know
          that after the fever breaks we are
          no longer contagious?

                    TOM
          I'm going to have to ask that you
          not use the pool during regular
          hours. I'll put time aside for you
          late in the day... and it won't be
          possible for you to eat in the
          dining room either. But I promise
          I'll find someplace suitable.

                    FRANKLIN
          They don't want us to eat in their
          presence?

                    TOM
          Of course for you I can make other
          accommodations.

                    FRANKLIN
              (a beat)
          That won't be necessary.

Franklin goes back to writing out the check. Tom stands
waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly
interminable. Their mutual discomfort is obvious.

Franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for Tom.

                       TOM
          Thank you.

                    FRANKLIN
          We still need a doctor here.

                       TOM
          For Fred?

                                                          59.

     Eleanor sits in a chair reading Franklin's letter.

                         FRANKLIN (V.O.)
               I am taking on responsibilities
               which none of my schooling in the
               spheres of higher learning or
               politics could have prepared me
               for... I have seen the casualties
               of war. But I have never seen this,
               a suffering so insidious, so
               silent, that it rattles my soul."

     Franklin is tucking Fred in for the night.

                         FRED
               When can I swim?

                         FRANKLIN
               Soon. When you're a little stronger.

                         FRED
               When I'm asleep, in my dreams, I
               can still walk.

                         FRANKLIN
               Me too.
                   (a beat)
               How long has it been... since you
               walked?

                          FRED
               Nine years. I'd just learned to
               ride a bike. After I got sick my
               mom was sure that the bike had
               caused it.

                                                                60.

                         FRANKLIN
               Did she sell it?

                         FRED
               No. She took it out back and shot it.

     Franklin howls with laughter, joined by Fred.

     Franklin is in the pool with the new guests. They are all
     nervously waiting to test the water.

     From the looks on their faces it's clear they only want to
     take their cues from Franklin.

     A MOTHER carries her adorable 4 year old GIRL into the water.

                         FRANKLIN
               And who is this delightful child?

                         DAISY
                   (giggling)
               Daisy.

                         FRANKLIN
               All right Daisy, try and kick your legs.

     Daisy wiggles back and forth in her MOTHER's arms giving it
     her very best effort.

                         FRANKLIN
               Excellent, Daisy!

     JAKE PERRINI, 32, Bronx-born with an upper body of steel
     wheels over to Roy who is fixing a wheelchair.

                         JAKE
               Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York.

                           ROY
               Roy, sir.

                         JAKE
               How you doin'?

     Jake reaches out his hand to shake. Roy is unsure what to do.

                         JAKE
               C'mon -- I won't bite.

                                                           61.

                    ROY
              (shaking his hand)
          Mighty fine, sir. Mighty fine.

                    JAKE
          Hey, would you mind pulling me
          outta this trap, Roy? I wanna get
          airborne.

Roy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms
like a child.

                    JAKE
          Do me one more favor? Throw me in?

Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air
emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before
SPLASHING down hard in the water.
H
 e bobs up to the surface. There is applause.

                    FRANKLIN
          Now folks, these exercises are of
          my own devising so bear with me.

Some laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for
everyone.

                    FRANKLIN
          My hope is that in repeating these
          movements over and over in the
          water I'm in some way causing the
          muscles to regenerate themselves
          and repair the damage.

He swims to the edge of the pool.

                    FRANKLIN
          So everybody grab the edge of the
          pool and move what you can!

 hey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them.

                    FRANKLIN
          Go ahead now, do your best!

Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred,
Franklin leads them on, spiritedly.

In the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching
everything.

     Segregated in a back room, all the polio guests are gathered
     for dinner seated around a couple of sawhorses with old doors
     thrown across them serving as makeshift dining tables.

     Roy carries DAISY in and places her in the chair next to
     Franklin.

                          RANKLIN
               Do you have a reservation?

     She begins to giggle. It's infectious and soon everyone has a
     smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the
     situation.

                         FRANKLIN
               Whether in here or our there, I
               guarantee you the food will taste
               the same... terrible.

                         DAISY
               Shouldn't we pray first?

                         FRANKLIN
               By all means. Would you do us the
               honor?

     Franklin bows his head for grace.

                         DAISY
               Bless the food on our table. Keep
               us healthy, strong and able. Amen.

     Franklin is in the water. Roy lifts Fred out of his
     wheelchair and gently puts him in the shallow end. Franklin
     receives him. Fred's face is ecstatic as he floats on his
     back in the water.

     A very old car comes coughing in, steam hissing from its
     engine.

     HELENA MAHONEY, 43, gets out of the driver's seat. Her iron

     Franklin and Roy, having finished lunch, are playing
     checkers. Fred is sitting nearby eating a piece of pie.

     Helena approaches. Roy pulls off a triple jump.

                      ROY
          King me.

Franklin reluctantly tops Roy's checker.

                    FRED
          You're losing, Doc.

                    HELENA
          Doc? I'm sorry, you're Franklin
          Roosevelt, aren't you?

                    FRANKLIN
          Depends.
              (suspiciously)
          Are you a lawyer?

                      HELENA
          No.

                    FRANKLIN
          Then Roosevelt it is. Wait!

He jumps one of Roy's checkers.

                     HELENA
          I'm Helena Mahoney. I'm a physical
          therapist.
              (off their blank looks)
          You have no idea who I am, do you?

                      FRANKLIN
          Should I?

                    HELENA
          I wrote you a letter right after I
          saw the article in the paper.
          Didn't you read it?

                    FRANKLIN
          It got read, I assure you. But
          probably not by me.

Helena glances down at the checkerboard and points to it.

                    HELENA
              (to Roy)
          He's open right there.

                                                       65.

                         ROY
               He sure is.

     Roy trounces Franklin with three swift moves.

                         ROY
               Thank you, ma'am.

     Helena sits at the table with them.

                         HELENA
               I've been studying the effects of
               moist heat on polio patients and I
               think with repeated exercise in
               warm water...

                         FRANKLIN
               It can help them regain lost
               strength.

                         HELENA
               Yes.

                         FRANKLIN
               Incredibly I've come to the same
               conclusion myself.

                         HELENA

               Well, you're the doctor.

               doctors... from the article in the

               I feel like I was brought here
               under false pretenses.

     Franklin lies across a makeshift examining table. Helena's
     examination is in progress.

     She is completely absorbed -- all business -- pouring over
     his muscles inch by inch. She kneads, bends and stretches
     them with a laser-like focus, finally picking up Franklin's
     leg and rotating it out and around.

                         HELENA
               Push against my hand.

     Franklin, with difficulty, tries to do so.

                         FRANKLIN
               Give me the good news first.

                         HELENA
               Your gluteus maximus is better than
               I hoped. It will serve you well.

                         FRANKLIN
               Must be all that sitting.

                         HELENA
               I'm serious. Your right leg has
               some movement along the thigh.
               That's good because we can use it
               to help extend your hip, flex your

               The water may help build some
               strength I'm not able to see yet.
               But to do that you would need to
               swim in the water much of the day.

          Sounds like you've been reading up.

                    FRANKLIN
          I wish there was more to read. Damn
          few things being written about any

          Roughly twelve hundred or so. Why?

          I want to buy it. I think it would
          make one hell of an investment.

          Investment?

                    FRANKLIN
          Twelve hundred acres? Enough for

                    TOM
          It would take money. There's a lot

     Helena is training a group of YOUNG MEN how to lift and carry
     using a raven haired young woman, ELOISE HUTCHISON, 18, as
     the test model. She sits shyly in her wheelchair before them.

               Woodhall, this is Eloise. Lift her
               gently.

                         HELENA
               Very good! Watch her braces.

     Woodhall kneels before Eloise like Prince Charming, carefully
     straightening out her legs.

               You're light as a ...

     He notices the long jagged scars along Eloise's wrists.
     Eloise, sensing his eyes, self-consciously pulls down her
     sleeves. He stares at her questioningly.

Tom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp. He
deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up
the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline.

He goes back into the house for one last bag. When he comes
out, he's surprised by what he sees --

                    FRANKLIN (O.S.)
          Where do you think you're going?

Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair. They are
both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a
blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning
chill.

Tom is caught. This is everything he wanted to avoid.

                    TOM
          Going to Asheville to see my
          parents.

From the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear
he is not coming back.

          I can't do this without you...
          we're only just beginning.

          You. (You're beginning, not me.
                a beat)
          I've got cancer, Franklin. It's
          spread everywhere.

Franklin is stunned -- utterly thrown.

                    FRANKLIN
          I... I'll take you to the best doctors.
          We'll go to Atlanta right now --

                    TOM
          I've seen the best doctors. When
          you were in New York they opened me
          up for the second time. Now I just
          want to die in the bed I was born.

Franklin is struggling with this.

                    TOM
          You're going to do great things.
          This place has an identity now --
          a purpose. It has you.

                                                                72.

     Any guard Franklin had is gone. He reaches out and takes Tom
     by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly.

                         TOM
               Take care of yourself, Roy.

                         ROY
               God be with you, Mr. Loyless.

     Tom takes one last look at Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
               You never pitied me. Thank you for that.

                         TOM
               On the contrary, I envy you.

               I will miss you all the days of my
               life.

     Tom gets into his car and looks at Franklin with a smile.

                         TOM
               Good luck, Franklin.

     turns onto the main road. Franklin watches the car until it

               If it's of any comfort to you, I
               agree.

               I'm against it as well. It will
               consume too much of his time and
               energy.

                         SARA
               Then it is settled. We tell him no.

                          ELEANOR
               No, it is not settled. We must hear
               him out. Louis and I must see for
               ourselves the work that he has been

               Perhaps I have underestimated you.

                         ELEANOR

The BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention.

Roy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother
Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out.

have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes
in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs.
It's a hand-controlled automobile.

                And this here's the gas.

                          FRED
                Hot damn! You got hand controls.

                          PAT
                That is a thing of beauty!

      Franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs.

                          PETE
                Now you got to push it real smooth
                or it goes all herky-jerky.

      Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up.

                          PETE
                Wait, Mr. Roosevelt, you're not
                ready to drive yet!

                          FRANKLIN
                Oh, yes I am!

      Franklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING
      the whole way down the driveway. Pete is yelling out
      instructions but Franklin ignores him.

      They all watch as he pulls away.

      As the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches
      across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out.
      Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin.

       ranklin is driving by himself with the top down, thrilled to
      be moving on his own. No one is pushing him. He's free. The
      car covers miles of farmland, passing pine forests, peach
      orchards and cotton fields.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

      A spent and anxious Eleanor, with Louis in tow, stands on the
      station platform, suitcase in hand.

                                                                 76.

                          LOUIS
                It's a far cry from Grand Central
                Station.

      They are both silent for a moment.

                          ELEANOR
                The wire said someone would be here
                to pick us up.

      The sounds of tires screeching and a car horn cause them to
      turn around.

      It is Franklin, sitting in the driver's seat of his car.

                          FRANKLIN
                Your chariot awaits, Madame!

      Louis promptly drops the luggage. Then he and Eleanor walk
      over to the car, taking in the hand-controls.

                          LOUIS
                When did you learn to drive this
                thing?

                           FRANKLIN
                Tuesday!

      Franklin, Eleanor and Louis pull up to the Inn. Though the
      brush has been cleared and the trees are newly trimmed, it's
      still a wreck. Franklin is too proud to concede Louis and
      Eleanor's disappointment.

                          FRANKLIN
                Can't wait to give you the tour!

      Franklin wheels himself along the circular driveway, pointing
      things out, almost manic in his energy.

                          FRANKLIN
                A small schoolhouse will go there.
                We need it badly as many of the
                children are barred from the local
                schools due to their infirmities.

                                                                 77.

      He points to a dilapidated gardener's shed.

                          FRANKLIN
                We also require a blacksmith's shop
                so we can craft braces here on the
                premises. I've found a wonderful
                local man who can make crutches and
                canes. His work is outstanding. Of
                course what is most desperately
                needed is a hospital. That's going
                to put my fund raising abilities to
                the test.

      Franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and
      Louis follow.

      Surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture
                           E
      Eleanor and Louis exchange glances.

                           LEANOR
                What exactly are you proposing,
                Franklin?

                          FRANKLIN
                That this will be the first polio
                rehabilitation and treatment center
                in the world. My personal trust
                almost covers the price of the Inn
                and the surrounding land. There
                will be a modest tuition charged to
                the patients which should hold us
                over while I seek out investors.

                          LOUIS
                Franklin, you're risking everything
                you have...

                          ELEANOR
                And there are other costs to
                consider.

                          FRANKLIN
                Mama will see that the children are
                provided for.

                          ELEANOR
                I'm not speaking of money.

                                                78.

                    FRANKLIN
          I have found something here which
          makes waking up in the morning
          remotely bearable and the two of
          you stand there...

                    ELEANOR
          Franklin, I need for you to be
          practical and realistic.

                    FRANKLIN
              (furious)
          Practical? I am trapped inside a
          body that no longer moves of my own
          volition. I am trying to be
          practical. Now either you're with
          me or against me. In or out!

                    ELEANOR
          I don't care for ultimatums
          disguised as debate.

Eleanor starts to leave.

                     FRANKLIN
          Where are you going? Eleanor! Get
          back here.

                    ELEANOR
          I will see you gentlemen tonight.

She leaves.

                    LOUIS
          You can't talk to her like that.

                    FRANKLIN
          Oh really? Are you an expert on
          this now? How should I speak to my
          wife, Louis?

                    LOUIS
          With the respect she deserves.
              (a beat)
          Look, I don't deny the work you're
          doing here could be important --

                      FRANKLIN
          Could be?

                                                              79.

                          LOUIS
                The issue is whether you want to
                run a rehabilitation center or
                whether you want to run for office
                again.

                          FRANKLIN
                When I can walk, I'll run.

      Eleanor approaches the pool. It is as quiet as a church. She
      is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the
      water.

      On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their
      bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in
      bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the
      Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs
      of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the
      work being done.

      Eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated.

      The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces,
      legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's
      legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret
      hand holding and hands on thighs.

      Jake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are
      particularly cozy.

                          FRANKLIN (O.S.)
                This is a very special night we're
                celebrating. At last we are together
                eating in this dining room!

      The hands come up and out from under the table, applauding.

      ON FRANKLIN

      He is in his wheelchair dressed in a jacket and tie.

                          FRANKLIN
                Now please join me in welcoming
                Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival
                along with her father, Samuel, all
                the way from Oakland, California.

                                                        80.

CLOSE-UP ON JACKIE

Eight years old with black hair. Her legs are in braces and
she grips her father's hand tightly.

ON FRANKLIN

                    FRANKLIN
          Let us also take this opportunity to
          welcome our two able-bodied guests,
          Mr. Louis Howe and my better half,
          Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt.

ON ELEANOR AND LOUIS

Waving politely from their seats.

                     FRANKLIN
          Now for the musical portion of our
          program...

                    JAKE
          Wait a minute! I can't let this
          opportunity pass without saying out
          loud what a lot of us feel in our
          hearts right now.
              (a beat)
          You're a man among men, Franklin.

                       A WOMAN'S VOICE
          And women!

                    DAISY
          And children!

                    JAKE
              (laughing)
          It's a real democracy at Warm
          Springs -- everybody gets heard!
              (to Franklin)
          You listening?

Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a
rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.

                     JAKE
          All right then, if I may do the
          honors of presenting to you the
          lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of
          Cottage C.

Eloise wheels herself out. In a sweet, but untrained voice,
she begins the introduction to her song:

                                                        81.

                     ELOISE
               (singing)
          "Think of what you're losing by
          constantly refusing to dance with me.
          Y
          Aou'd be the idol of France with me.
            nd yet you stand there
          And shake your foolish head dramatically,
          W
            hile I sit here so ecstatically.
          You just look and say emphatically:
          Not this season!
          There's a reason!"

Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's
coming. Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch.

Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs.

                    ELOISE & CHORUS
              (singing)
          "I won't dance! Don't ask me!
          I won't dance! Don't ask me;
          I won't dance, monsieur, with you."

Simple, but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs,
has the audience cheering.

                    ELOISE & CHORUS
          "My heart won't let my feet do
                    C
          things they should do."

                     HORUS
          "You know what? You're lovely."

                    ELOISE
          "And so what? I'm lovely."

                    CHORUS
          "But oh! What you do to me!
          I'm like an ocean wave that's
          bumped on the shore;
          I feel so absolutely stumped on the
          floor!"

This is too much for the crowd, including Franklin, Eleanor
and Louis. They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight
of Eloise and her Chorus.

The song finished, Franklin quiets down the crowd.

                                                                 82.

                           FRANKLIN
                 Before we say good night,
                 I understand our Royal-Taskmaster-
                 in-Residence, Miss Mahoney, insists
                 on having the last word.

      Helena rises from her seat.

                           HELENA
                 I don't think words describe
                 adequately what Daisy and I would
                 like to show all of you.
                     (calling out)
                 Are you ready, Daisy?

      Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the
      room where Helena meets them. Helena bends down and removes
      Daisy's braces.

      The room is hushed.

      Daisy then begins to WALK tentatively towards her mother.

      ON FRANKLIN

      Overwhelmed by what is taking place. He looks around and
      takes in the sight of so many different faces...

      Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look
      away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of
      their own private battles.

      ON DAISY

      Only a step or two away from her mother she FALLS the short
      distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms.

      WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with
      pride. She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with
      his own -- genuine and beatific.

      INT. COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Roy lifts Franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed.

      Eleanor enters holding a lit candle.

      Roy is about to begin Franklin's bedtime routine, but Eleanor
      gently reaches out and touches him on the arm.

                            ELEANOR
                 Let me.

                                                          83.

Roy looks to Franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits.
Eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau.
A
 fter a beat, Franklin begins to unbuckle his pants. He then
lies back on the bed.

                    ELEANOR
          What is your most pressing concern?

Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so
as not to catch on the braces.

Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the
back of a chair.

                    FRANKLIN
          Getting a doctor to live on the
          premises full-time. Someone who,
          at the very least, could monitor
          our progress. Make us legitimate.

She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of
intricate buckles.

Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now
deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing
his shoes.

                    ELEANOR
          And that costs more money.

                    FRANKLIN
          Yes.

Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels
once again to untie his shoelaces.

                    FRANKLIN
          But the real problem is no one is
          interested. The annual Orthopedics
          Convention is being held in Atlanta
          this weekend and I offered to
          speak.
              (his anger surfacing)
          They turned me down flat.

Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with
tender care pulls them up his legs.

                                                          84.

                    ELEANOR
          A few weeks ago, the conditions at
          a garment factory on West 27th
          Street were brought to my
          attention. The owners claimed
          everything was satisfactory, but
          would never let anyone in to
          conduct a proper inspection.

She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated
position. They are now face to face.

                    ELEANOR
          It took awhile, but we finally got in.

                    FRANKLIN
          We?

He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become.
He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top.

Eleanor sits in a chair across from him.

                    ELEANOR
          I showed up with someone from the
          Labor Board and we refused to leave
          until they let us in.

                    FRANKLIN
          What are you suggesting?

                    ELEANOR
          At the risk of my good standing
          with the Junior Assistance League,
          I suggest we crash the party.

She stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand
through his hair.    E
                     LEANOR
          Good night, Franklin.

She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light
against the candle-lit room.

                    FRANKLIN
          Good night, Babs.

She blows the candle out and closes the door.

                          E




                                                              85.

      Franklin's car pulls up to a massive stone building built in
      Greek revival style. Franklin looks intimidated -- there are
      two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance.

      EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - CONTINUOUS
109                                                            109
      Roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with Franklin slung
      over his shoulder. Using enormous force, Eleanor is pulling
      the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up
      the stairs.

      INT. AMPHITHEATER - DAY

      The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large
      projections on a screen of spinal discs while a DOCTOR, in a
      dull litany, intones a prepared speech.

                          DOCTOR
                A clinical situation where the
                radicular or nerve root is
                compressed by the prolapsed disc is
                referred to as a radiculopathy.

      Double doors fly open with a BANG as all heads turn to see
      Franklin and Eleanor.

                          ELEANOR
                So sorry we're late!

                          FRANKLIN
                Good afternoon!

      Eleanor talks quickly while wheeling Franklin down the aisle.

                          ELEANOR
                    (introducing herself)
                Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of the
                late President Theodore Roosevelt
                and this is my husband, Franklin,
                former Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

                          FRANKLIN
                    (sotto to Eleanor)
                Are you sure this worked on 27th
                Street?

                           LEANOR
                    (under her breath)
                It seemed to at the time.

                                                          86.

They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag
reads, "Dr. Bissell."

                     ELEANOR
           Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing
           to let us share the stage with you
           today. It was so generous of you.

Dr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely
applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage.

                     ELEANOR
           My husband, as many of you may have
           read, is a victim of polio.
           However, victim is only a
           definition, not a state of mind.
           Franklin?

He looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an
                     F
encouraging nod to take over.

                      RANKLIN
           We all know that poor circulation
           is a chronic problem for limbs
           damaged by polio... I've never been
           able to swim more than a few
           minutes without becoming too cold.
           But there's a place, gentlemen...
           a miraculous place not three hours
           from here where the water is filled
           with natural minerals at a
           temperature of almost 90 degrees.
           That place, gentlemen, is called
           Warm Springs.

CLOSE-UP

One DOCTOR in particular, 60's, leans forward in his chair,
listening with great interest.

                     FRANKLIN
           Patients can stay in these waters
           for up to an hour. This is
           essential in allowing them the time
           to work on strengthening their
           muscles.

                     ELEANOR
           We have come to the shared
           conclusion that research for the
           cause and the cure for infantile
           paralysis is paramount.

                However, until NOR(cont'd)
                          ELEA that day arrives
                more emphasis has be placed on
                rehabilitation. We personally
                invite you to Warm Springs to come
                and take a look. Thank you.

      ON THE AUDIENCE

      These "men of science" are mesmerized by Eleanor's style,
      both warm and immediate. She has disarmed them with her lack
      of pretension.

      ON FRANKLIN and ELEANOR

      Their two separate journeys intersecting -- lightning in a
      bottle.

      INT. LOBBY - DAY
111                                                            111
      There is a receiving line in place to get a last word or an
      autograph with Franklin and Eleanor. DR. WILLIS,
      bespectacled, speaks with them.

                          DR. WILLIS
                I saw you speak at the Legion Hall
                in Cleveland last Spring.

                          ELEANOR
                For the League of Women Voters?

                          DR. WILLIS
                You created quite a stir. Not sure
                you'll be asked back.

      Franklin is ready to intervene but Eleanor puts her hand on
                           E
      his shoulder stopping him.

                           LEANOR
                    (all smiles)
                Well, I believe you must say what
                you feel in your heart -- what you
                feel is right, for you'll be
                criticized anyway. Damned if you do
                -- damned if you don't.

      DR. HEBERT, military in bearing -- the doctor who listened so
      intensely -- steps up in line and shakes hands with Eleanor
      and then Franklin.

                          DR. HEBERT
                Dr. Peter Hebert. I've been doing
                my own studies in this area.

                          DR. HEBERT(cont'd)
                If it is possible I'd like to come
                and make an evaluation for the
                Journal of Orthopedic Medicine.

      Franklin looks to Eleanor, elated.

                          FRANKLIN
                The sooner the better.

      EXT. FRANKLIN'S CAR - TWILIGHT

      Roy is fast asleep tucked around the wheelchair in the back
      seat.

      Franklin smiles in Eleanor's direction. She looks back at him
      shyly and smiles in return. But her expression changes when
      she sees something in his eyes -- something she hasn't seen
      for a long time.

                          ELEANOR
                What is it?

                          FRANKLIN
                    (a beat)
                Who are you?

      Franklin reaches out and takes her hand, pulling her close.
      He stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on
      one of the driving knobs, his hand on top of hers.

                          ELEANOR
                I don't know how to drive.

                          FRANKLIN
                I'll teach you.

      They operate the car together -- their connection complete.

      EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY
113                                                               113
      Franklin and Eleanor are sitting in the front seat of the
      car. Louis is already up on the train platform.

                          ELEANOR
                I'll break the news to Mama.

      Franklin smiles as they look at each other like two naughty
      children.

                          ELEANOR
                I think it's going to be fun.

      Eleanor bursts out laughing, Franklin joins in.

                             F




                                                               89.

                          FRANKLIN
                Babs... words fail me.

                          ELEANOR
                You? Franklin Roosevelt?

      She leans in and kisses Franklin on the mouth.

                          ELEANOR
                I do so love you.

      She slides out of the car and goes up to the platform and
      A
      boards the train while Franklin watches her.

        Farmer and his Wife from the school house graduation
      approach Franklin.

                           ARMER
                Mr. Roosevelt you lookin' mighty fit.

                          FARMER'S WIFE
                Fine day, isn't it.

                           FRANKLIN
                It is. How's the Boll Weevil
                situation?

                          FARMER'S WIFE
                I expect the Boll Weevil is always
                gonna be a situation, Mr.
                Roosevelt, but thanks for askin'.

      Franklin's energy and vitality are infectious. The politician
      within him is being reborn.

      A beaming Eleanor sits down next to Louis. He too is looking
      very pleased. Eleanor takes notice.

                          ELEANOR
                Why do I get the feeling we're not
                smiling about the same thing?

      The train begins pulling out.

      They both look out at Franklin. Locals are coming up to his
      car surrounding him -- he is a magnet.

                          LOUIS
                He's ready.

                                                              90.

      Louis is seated in the front row of the balcony of the State
      Assembly, his feet up on the railing, eating pistachio nuts.

      Also seated are two politicos, JAMES HASTINGS and STEPHEN
      TELLER.

                          HASTINGS
                You can't kiss babies from a
                wheelchair. It'll scare their
                mothers half to death.

                          TELLER
                Al Smith's got a lock on the
                presidential nomination.

                          LOUIS
                Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't
                you think even after all these
                years that old Al's still a little
                rough around the edges?

      They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement.

                          LOUIS
                Franklin can help soften his image.

                          HASTINGS
                How?

                          LOUIS
                Let him put Smith's name in
                nomination.

      Teller and Hastings are none to sure.

                          TELLER
                Well, he is a helluva speech maker.

                          HASTINGS
                Yeah, but is your man up to it?

                          LOUIS
                It's in the bag, guys. Count on it.

      Bluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like
      they're buying it.

      Just then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor.

                          LOUIS
                Hey, Stansbury, give my best to the
                Misses!
                    (to Hastings and Teller)

      An empty wheelchair, illuminated by a sliver of moonlight.

      On a blanket nearby are Jake and Mary Beth.

       he unbuttons his shirt and runs her hands over his
      impressively developed upper body. They begin to kiss
      hungrily, passionately -- completely in their own world.

      Several yards away, across the lawn, Eloise is in
      Woodhall's arms -- they are dancing. He is singing softly
      into her ear as they sway, her feet never touching the ground.

       NT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT

      Helena, in a nightgown, is looking out a window into the
      distance. Fiercely protective and slightly envious of her
      charges, she pulls a pack of cigarettes from her bathrobe
      pocket and steals a solitary smoke.

      Franklin seated alone on the porch in the darkness. He drags
      on his cigarette and the red glow illuminates the contours of
      his face in repose.

      Franklin is on the phone. Roy stands by his side.

                          FRANKLIN
                Hello, Souders. How are you?...
                Couldn't be better. I was wondering
                if you'd found a buyer for my naval
                prints?
                    (clearly not)
                I see. Well, they're in marvelous
                condition... All right, Souders. Oh
                one more thing... I have some
                beautiful pieces of my
                Grandfather's -- T'ang Dynasty...
                Really?... An auction in the Fall?
                That sounds promising. I'll be in
                touch.

      Franklin hangs up and sits deep in thought. He rubs his
      perspiring forehead with the back of his hand. He looks down
      at his hand and sees that it is shaking.

      Franklin is walking on crutches aided by Roy. Nearby, a group
      of children practice on parallel bars with Helena.

                What am I going to tell these people
                if I have to close things down?

                          ROY
                That you did the best you could.

      Franklin gives Roy a look of gratitude, then notices Lionel
      approaching with his mail bag.

      Lionel hands Franklin a fistful of open envelopes.

                          FRANKLIN
                Any good news?

                          LIONEL
                Creditors are gettin' cranky.

                          FRANKLIN
                The operative word was good.

                          LIONEL
                Oh, yah, almost forgot. The doctor
                that came and studied ya'll sent
                his report.

                                                              93.

      Lionel offers up the envelope, but then pulls it back before
      handing it over.

                          LIONEL
                Save me the stamps?

      Franklin nods then grabs it from Lionel. He rips it open and
      begins devouring the report.

                            FRANKLIN
                     (reading)
                "... therefore, in conclusion, my
                research has shown that the
                overwhelming majority of patients
                here have shown some improvement.
                Enough for me to recommend warm
                water therapy as the standard post
                polio treatment to the Orthopedics
                Society of America!"
                     (
                       he grips Roy's arm)
                Roy!

      Something catches Franklin's eye and his smile begins to fade.

                          ROY
                What is it, sir?

      INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

      Helena entering the cottage.

                          HELENA
                It's not as bad as you think.

      Franklin slams the door behind her and wheels over to the
      table. He throws back a drink -- clearly not his first.

                          FRANKLIN
                Read it. Out loud. Page twenty-nine.

                          HELENA
                I already...

                          FRANKLIN
                    (angrily)
                Read it!

                          HELENA
                "Of the twenty three patients examined
                only one, a forty-four year old male,
                showed little visible signs of
                improvement..." This is one doctor's
                opinion, Franklin.

H




                                                          94.

                    FRANKLIN
          Keep reading.

                    HELENA
          "There is marked falling away of
          the muscle masses on either side of
          the spine in the lower lumbar
          region. His lower extremities
          present a most depressing picture."

She brings the pages down, but Franklin gestures her to
continue.

                    HELENA
          "I feel after studying him that the
          psychological factor in his
          management is paramount. He has
          such courage and ambition. Yet at
          the same time he is such an
          extraordinarily sensitive emotional
          mechanism...

It is difficult for her to continue.

                    FRANKLIN
          Please.

                    HELENA
          ... that it will take all the skill
          which we can muster to lead him
          successfully to a recognition of
          his severe physical limitations
          without crushing him."

                    FRANKLIN
          Patronizing son-of-a-bitch! I
          wanted to walk again.

                    HELENA
          And you still might. This report
          legitimizes we've worked so hard
          for. We can raise funs now. It
          could change everything!

                    FRANKLIN
          It won't change anything for me.

                    HELENA
          Franklin, I won't play this game. I
          won't feel sorry for you.

 e reaches for the bottle, but Helena grabs on to it,
stopping him.

                                                        95.

                     HELENA
          I met a boy today, ten years old.
          He's paralyzed from the waist down.
          Why don't you go regale him with
          vivid tales about your trips to
          Europe and playing football at
          school. Tell him how you courted
          your wife and fathered children.
          Tell him of a life he can only
          dream of.
              (
                a beat)
          I can't help you out of a hole if I
          climb in with you. Then we're both
          stuck.

INT. MERIWETHER INN - FRONT DESK - DAY

Fred, wearing a bow tie and an oversized jacket, is proudly
polishing off a desktop sign that reads: "FRED BOTTS:
DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS."

Helena is behind him reading a file.

                    LIONEL
              (entering)
          Here's another one he's refusin'.

He throws a telegram onto an already large stack.

                    HELENA
          Why don't you read it?

                    LIONEL
          Don't like telegrams. All them
          STOPS and stuff.

                    HELENA
          Make you dizzy, Lionel.

                    LIONEL
          A little bit.

Fred eyes the telegram, then impulsively grabs it, ripping it
open.

                    FRED
          "Would be honored if you place my
          name in nomination for President.
          STOP. The party needs you. STOP.
          Yours sincerely, Al Smith."

                      LIONEL
          Who's he?

                    (




                                                                96.

                          HELENA
                The Governor of New York.
                     handing it to Lionel)
                Why don't you slide it under
                his door?

                          LIONEL
                All right. Probably slide it
                right back.

      Lionel leaves. Fred and Helena are silent for a moment.

                          FRED
                He won't go. He doesn't want to be
                seen walking on crutches or being
                wheeled to the podium.

                          HELENA
                The millions listening on radio
                won't be able to see that.

                          FRED
                But all the people at the
                convention will.

      Helena nods, "That's right."

                                                        CUT TO:

      Responding to a knock at the door, Roy gets up from sitting
      on the couch with Franklin, sullen and inattentive.
      H
       e opens the door to Louis who walks right in.

                          ROY
                Good afternoon, Mr. Howe.

                          LOUIS
                Hello, Roy.

      Roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom.

                          LOUIS
                I can't believe you've made me come
                all the way back to this hell hole!

                          FRANKLIN
                I've done no such thing.

F




                                                        97.

                    LOUIS
          I'm here to take you to Houston.
          You started your speech yet?

                    FRANKLIN
          I'm not going.

He stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes
over to the sidebar and pours one for himself.

                    LOUIS
          You know what this is, don't you?
          It's a golden opportunity. A
          springboard for you to run for
          Governor.

 ranklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in
Franklin's empty wheelchair.

                    LOUIS
          Ever hear of a Civil War General
          named Francis Nicholls?

                    FRANKLIN
          No.

                    LOUIS
          Well, I never heard of him either.
          But this was one brave son-of-a-
          bitch. Fought for the Confederacy
          and lost his left arm in one battle
          and his left foot in another. Then
          after the war he ran and won the
          Governorship of Louisiana -- twice!

                    FRANKLIN
          He was a war hero.

                    LOUIS
              (with emphasis)
          Twice.
              (a beat)
          Look, I've worked like a dog to
          keep your name in play, grovelling
          at the feet of the powers-that-be
          in back rooms.

                    FRANKLIN
          As much for you as for me.

                                                              98.

                          LOUIS
                I'll be damned if I'm going to let
                you pass up a chance like this.
                It's time -- and you're ready.

      Waiting on the porch are Eleanor and Helena, who are seated,
      talking. Louis exits the cottage, defeated.

                             LOUIS
                Your turn.

      Eleanor rises and goes into the cottage as Louis takes her
      seat next to Helena.

                          ELEANOR
                Roy, so good to see you.

                           ROY
                Very good to see you, Mrs.
                Roosevelt.

      She approaches a surprised Franklin. Leaning in, she runs a
      hand across his stubbly beard. He looks up at her.

                          ELEANOR
                You're a mess.

                          FRANKLIN
                The report. I'll never...

      She sits by his side and Franklin begins to cry. His sobs
      grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him. It
      unleashes an avalanche of grief.

                          ELEANOR
                Oh my darling...

                          FRANKLIN
                I'm useless, Eleanor. I feel so
                useless.

                          ELEANOR
                That's not true. No one can make
                you feel inferior without your
                consent.

      Finally, his sobs subside.

                          ELEANOR
                You have done a brilliant thing
                here -- a magnificent thing.

      Eleanor picks up the E
                           doctor's report and puts it in the fire.

                           LEANOR
                Let's get you in the water.

      EXT. THE POOL - DAY

      Franklin is wheeled down to the pool by Roy and Eleanor. When
      they get closer, Franklin makes out someone already swimming.

                            ELLIOT
                Hi, Pop!

                          FRANKLIN
                   (squinting)
                Who's that?

      ELLIOT ROOSEVELT is now 17 years old. He has his mother's
      enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma.

                            FRANKLIN
                Elliot!

                           LLIOT
                Come on! You getting in?

      Louis and Helena approach the pool.

                          FRANKLIN
                I sense a conspiracy.

                          LOUIS
                You ain't seen nothin' yet.

       ranklin smiles, warily.

      EXT. A CLEARING - DAY
129                                                               129
      Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as
      Franklin and Eleanor look up at him. Franklin is standing on
      crutches.

      Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin
      with a single cane.

                          HELENA
                Franklin, let go of your crutches.
                You're not going to need them.

                                                       100.

                    FRANKLIN
          What?

                    HELENA
          We're going to make your arms
          function as your legs.

                    FRANKLIN
          How is that possible?

                    HELENA
          Elliot, go to your father and stand
          on his left side.

                    ELLIOT
          Think this may work, Pop.

                    HELENA
          Eleanor, take the crutch.

Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing
it in Franklin's hand with a cane.

Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's
arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks
Franklin's left arm around his.

Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.

                    HELENA
              (to Franklin)
          Now use your right shoulder and
          pull your left leg forward.

He does so.

                    HELENA
          Good! Now with the muscles in your
          left shoulder, pull your right leg.

                    FRANKLIN
          One small bump and I'll land right
          on my keister!

                    HELENA
          That's what Elliot is for. He's
          going to hold you up. Hitch your
          leg! Come on!

Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense
strength and effort on both their parts.

                                                          101.

                     HELENA
              (ever the taskmaster)
          Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up
          straight. Pull against him. He
          needs you!

After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin.

                     FRANKLIN
          I can't.

                    ELLIOT
          I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me.

                    HELENA
          You can do this, Franklin! Keep
          going!

They start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but
it's working.

                    LOUIS
              (under his breath)
          I'll be damned.

Franklin stops, exhausted.

                    ELEANOR
          Franklin, are you all right?

                    FRANKLIN
          I'm fine. I'm just...

Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as
Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him,
concerned.

                    HELENA
          This isn't a replacement for the real
          work we're doing to get you on your
          feet again, understand? No one is
          throwing in the towel or even agreeing
          with that doctor's report...

                    FRANKLIN
          I know, I know.

                    HELENA
          I know it's not practical --

                          FRANKLIN
                No, it's not.
                    (a beat)
                It's political.

      Franklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that
      this could be it.

      Franklin and Elliot are walking. Helena is close behind,
      coaching.

                           ELENA
                Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch
                your weight to Elliot... good! Keep
                your head up.

      Off to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are
      having an informal picnic, observing Franklin.

                          ELOISE
                Why is he working so hard to hide it?

                          JAKE
                He doesn't have a choice.

                          ELOISE
                Oh, I disagree.

                          JAKE
                How can you disagree? "There but
                for the grace of God goes us,"
                that's what they're saying. As if
                our bodies is who we are, but it's
                not. It's our souls is who we are,
                but they don't know that.

                          ELOISE
                I wish he could just wheel himself
                out there in front of everybody.

                          PAT
                He can't do that Eloise, it's
                politics.

                          JAKE
                It's not gonna matter if he hides
                his legs as long as he don't hide
                what he knows. And what he knows is
                what it's like to be one of us.

       ranklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting.

                                                             103.

                          FRANKLIN
                Good afternoon, everyone!

      Off-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with
      him.

      Eleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is
      there first.

                          HELENA
                Take a moment to catch your breath...

                          FRANKLIN
                Damn. You okay son?

                          ELLIOT
                I'm fine, Pop.

                          DAISY
                You fell down.

                          FRANKLIN
                Yes, I did, Daisy. Twelfth time
                today. Must be a new record!

      Daisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their
      concern.

      Franklin struggles hard as Roy and Elliot help him to his
      feet.

      INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

      Eleanor is packing Franklin's suitcase while Franklin,
      sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas, works on his speech.

                           FRANKLIN
                    (reading aloud)
                And so America must find...
                    (
                      reconsidering)
                No, America needs a pathfinder...

      Louis, pacing in shirtsleeves, nods approvingly.

                          LOUIS
                That's good.

                          FRANKLIN
                To emblaze the trail along a high
                road that will avoid... avoid the
                bottomless morass...

      Discouraged, Franklin pushes aside the pages.

                                                              104.

                          LOUIS
                What is it? What's wrong?

                          FRANKLIN
                What if I fall... trying to get to
                the podium.

                          LOUIS
                If you fall, you show them how to
                get up.

                          FRANKLIN
                No, if I fall in front of thousands
                of people I lose everything but
                their pity.
                    (a beat)
                They'll be writing my obituary
                before I get up off the floor.

                          LOUIS
                Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be
                there. All the arrangements have
                been made, boss. It'll be fine.

                          FRANKLIN
                Who are we fooling? This will never
                work. They'll never let me back
                into politics. They'll never see
                past my legs.

                          ELEANOR
                My darling, they'll never see past
                your legs unless you do.

      EXT. MERIWETHER INN - MORNING

      Franklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided
      by Roy. Eleanor is seated next to him; Louis and Elliot in
      back.

      Franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees
      straight ahead.

      It is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway
      in chairs and on crutches.

      All the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists,
      Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel.

                          FRED
                Don't worry, Doc -- we're not
                coming with you.

                       F




                                                       105.

                     FRANKLIN
          Oh, you'll be with me. No question
          of that.
              (a beat)
          I am proud more than you will ever
          know to be part of this community.
              (his voice growing
                stronger)
          A community based not on birthright
          or privilege, but on compassion and
          courage. The true power of these
          waters is that they brought us all
          together. Our ability to help one
          another is what will make our
          victory over polio endure. Our
          ability to survive... despite the
          odds.
F
 ranklin looks out at the sea of faces.

                    FRANKLIN
          What we have done and will continue
          to do until this disease is
          defeated is come together -- like a
          family -- and do what we do best...
              (his voice breaking)
          Lift each other up.

Franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse.
Then, spying Helena, Franklin calls out to her.

                    FRANKLIN
          Miss Mahoney I need to speak with
          you, please.

                       HELENA
          Sure, Doc.

Off her smile, Franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws
a small box.

                       FRANKLIN
          Thank you.

He hands it to Helena. She just stares at it, at a loss for
words.

                        RANKLIN
          Open it.

She does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch.

                                                              106.

                          HELENA
                It's beautiful.

                          FRANKLIN
                Don't wear it in the pool.

                          HELENA
                I'll try not to. Good luck,
                Franklin.

                          FRANKLIN
                I'm throwing myself to the wolves.

                          HELENA
                You've faced worse. And if they
                bite, you can come back here.

                          FRANKLIN
                I'll always come back here.

      Helena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the
      driveway.

                                                        CUT TO:

      INT. HOUSTON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

      Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of
      stairs. Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. If
      possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis.

                          FRANKLIN
                You're being superstitious, Louis.
                There aren't any reporters here.

      Suddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a
      dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight
      of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the
      arms of a black man.

      No one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the
      wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take
      another.

      But DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and
      a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places
      a massive hand over the lens.

      Slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down.

                            REED
                      (
                       quietly)
                No.

                                                             107.

      Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the
      scene unfold

      Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the
      chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it.

      It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his
      authority is unquestioned.

      But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed
      isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the
      back, pulling out the film and exposing it.

                             PHOTOGRAPHER
                Hey!

                          REED
                    (tipping his hat)
                Good to see you, Mr. Roosevelt.

                             FRANKLIN
                Thank you.

      The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS
      and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage.

      He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking
      out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth.

      Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his
      waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket.

      Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to
      him he quickly ducks down behind the podium.

      The sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees,
      NAILS the podium to the floor.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

      Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It
      is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand-
      held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once --
      most bearing the words "SMITH FOR PRESIDENT."

      Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO
      REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking
      microphone.

                                                                108.

      Hovering in a group off to the side are Dan Reed and the
      REPORTERS from the previous night.

      Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's
      arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As
      everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is
      perspiring more than F
                           most.

                           RANKLIN
                Where is she seated?

      Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop
      Franklin's brow with a handkerchief.

                          LOUIS
                In a box stage left. Give me your
                hand.

      Franklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis
      wipes it, gently.

                          FRANKLIN
                Louis, what the hell am I doing?

                          LOUIS
                Putting your big toe in the water.

      Just then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers:

                          LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
                Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
                to introduce to you a man who as
                Assistant Secretary of the Navy
                served our country with distinction.
                  member of an illustrious family
                of long-standing political
                commitment to our great nation...
                Ladies and gentlemen: Franklin
                Delano Roosevelt!

      Franklin turns to Elliot and they both take deep breaths.

                          FRANKLIN
                    (to Elliot)
                Let's go.

      The curtains part and they begin moving forward.

                                                             109.

      INT. THE STAGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION - CONTINUING 137
137
      A BLINDING SPOTLIGHT picks up Franklin and Elliot. The
      SPOTLIGHT follows them as they make their way to the podium.

      Franklin is hitching each leg forward, slowly. The tip of his
      cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and
      support.

      He leans heavily on Elliot's arm. The walk appears effortless.

      He chats with Elliot the whole way, still managing to flash
      the CONVENTIONEERS his million dollar smile. But the walk is
      slow and the ovation is beginning to fade.

      Eleanor sits looking down at her lap, afraid to even breathe.

      Franklin and Elliot are still ten steps away from the podium.
      Sensing the crowd noise weakening, he whispers to Elliot.

                          FRANKLIN
                Laugh as if I'm making a joke.

      Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to
      be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER!

      But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration
      from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip.

      Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and
      finally they reach the podium.

      Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a
      sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's
      braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from
      his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium.

      THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread
      wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on
      tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip.

      FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing
      tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING.

      Franklin has made it. He is home.

      All the denizens of Warm Springs are crowded around the radio.

                           RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                Here on the stage is Franklin
                Roosevelt... a figure tall and
                proud even in suffering; a face of
                classic profile; a frame nervous
                and yet self-controlled. A man
                softened, cleansed and illumined
                with pain.

 42   INT. WARWICK HOTEL, HOUSTON - SMITH'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS 142

      GOVERNOR AL SMITH, 51, is seated by a radio, surrounded by
      CRONIES. An overblown Irishman with gold capped teeth and
      heavy New York accent. He chomps on a lit cigar that never
      leaves the side of his mouth.

                          CRONY #1
                Hell of an ovation, Al. Couldn't
                have asked for anything more.

      Smith sits silently puffing on his cigar.

                          CRONY #2
                You may have to be careful though.
                Looks like you're raising up a rival.

                          SMITH
                    (after a beat)
                Mark my words. He'll be dead in a year.

      Eleanor applauds Franklin as a REPORTER leans in.

                Mrs. Roosevelt, one last question.

                          ELEANOR
                Yes?

                          REPORTER
                Do you think polio has affected

                Yes, I do. I certainly do.

      Franklin stands before the crowd. His magnetism is
      incontestable. He radiates infinite possibility.

      He looks up to Eleanor's box and they smile at one another as
      the crowd continues to applaud.

      The mineral springs gently ripple as Franklin appears in the
      water. As the following words appear on the screen, Franklin
      slowly and confidently swims out of frame.

                                CRAWL

      Four years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected
      President of the United States. He was elected three more
      times -- unprecedented in U.S. History.

      During his years as President, he saw the country through the
      Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents.

      On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency,
      at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his
      cottage at Warm Springs.

      The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was
      Warm Springs... which continues to flourish as a
      rehabilitation center to this day.

          PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church
          holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other
          PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.

          Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and
          drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He
          listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight
          bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,
          Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-
          collar neighborhood high above the city.

          TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the
          stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter
          coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a
          brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops
          a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the
          approaching night.
                         
                         
          EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off
          the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he
          approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his
          eyes.
                         
                          PADDY
           Tommy?
                         
          Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           What're you doing here?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I was just passing through. Figured
           why not have a belt with the old
           man.
           2.
                         
                         
          Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
          long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           She looks good.
                         
                          PADDY
           (patting car hood)
           Yeah, she's hanging in there.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Well, you always did take good care
           of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of
           priorities.
                         
          Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
          stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
          fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Got a little something for ya. Mom
           always said never go anywhere empty
           handed.
                         
                          PADDY
           She did. But that's not for me
           anymore, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           What? You change brands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not
          drinking? What gives?
                         
                          PADDY
           C'mon, let's go inside.
                         
          Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a
          confused Tommy follows.

          Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is
          clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy
          stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place
          in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I like what you've done with the

           Appreciate that.
                         
          The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes
          off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He
          glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca
          lounge chair.
                         
                          TOMMY
           There's not much of a woman's touch
           around here.
                         
           PADDY (O.S.)
           No more women for me, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl
           who can take a punch nowadays.
                         
          Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
          series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
          into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
          wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.
                         
                          PADDY
           Here you go.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in
           14 years and you're not gonna have
           a drink with him?
                         
                          PADDY
           I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming
           up on a thousand days.
                         
                          TOMMY
           C'mon, just one drink.
                         
                          PADDY
           No.
                         
          Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns
          back to the photos. He takes them in.

          Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a
          mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING
          WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in
          the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.

           He's a school teacher down in
           Philly.
                         
          Tommy's face registers surprise.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Remember Tess? They've got two
           beautiful little girls.
                         
          Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of
          the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at
          the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           So you found God, huh? That's
           awesome. Mom kept calling for him,
           but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus
           was down at the mill forgiving all
           the drunks. Who knew?
                         
          Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           So, you gonna ask about her, or you
           just gonna sit there all sober?
                         
                          PADDY
           I know.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Oh, you know? What do you know? Do
           you know it wasn't enough just to
           drive west to get away from you?
           When we hit the water we drove
           north, too.
                         
                          PADDY
           When I got sober I hired a man to
           find you.

                          TOMMY
           (taking a swig)
           Is that one of the 12 steps? Or
           does a guy like you get 24?
                         
                          PADDY
           Just the 12.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Did your guy tell you what you
           needed to know?
                         
                          PADDY
           Just that your mother died in
           Tacoma. And you were in the
           Marines. That was all. That was
           enough.
                         
                          TOMMY
           That's too bad. You could've gotten
           some good details.
                         
          Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee
          table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND
          PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
          MOBY DICK.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           You could've heard about her
           coughing up blood in a shit box
           with no heat. Having me rub her
           down with holy water, because she
           didn't have no insurance. All the
           while waiting for your pal Jesus to
           save her. Did your man tell you
           that?
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm sorry, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's good to know you're sorry,
           Pop. Goes a long way.
                         
          Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           I think I liked you better when you
           were a drunk.
                         
          An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who
          is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his
          eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.
           6.
                         
                         
          Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of
          Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son.
          Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class
          home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run
          about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some
          whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces
          painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
                         
          TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like
          a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.
          She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a
          lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.
                         
          THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A
          BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN
          AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.
                         
                          TESS
           What's going on here?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, I'm not sure, but I think
           Daddy is now a princess.
                         
          Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"
          expression.
                         
                          TESS
           Em, you want to open your presents?
                         
          The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
          Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
          gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
                         
          Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
          the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered
          in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           (off pink box)
           This an awfully big box.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's her birthday.
                         
          Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't
          look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift
          with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.
           7.
                         
                         
                          TESS
                          (TEASING)
           I know, but that's why you call it
           a budget. You set it, and you don't
           budge.
                         
          Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the
          lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to
          her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set.
                         
          She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan
          pressing free weights on an old bench.
                         
                         
          INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag
          of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make-
          up, is visible on his cheek.
                         
                          TESS
           Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying
           goodbye to the girls. She's gotta
           get on the road. They've been fed.
           They just need a bath.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm on it.
                         
                          TESS
           Can you get them down at a
           reasonable time tonight? They're
           exhausted.
                         
          Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Where's the rest of that skirt?
                         
                          TESS
           Babe.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Listen, if any guys give you a
           hassle in that joint tonight you
           give me a call, okay?
           8.
                         
                         
                          TESS
           (off his cut)
           Yeah. Just like you gave me a call
           when those Temple frat boys decided
           to smash up your face.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I told you, most nights I sit on
           the stool and grade papers, but
           every now and then I need some
           action.
                         
                          TESS
           Alright, well wait up for me
           tonight. I'll see what I can do
           about that.
                         
          Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Promises, promises.
                         
                         
          INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY
                         
          A big, old-school warehouse, where a handful of GUYS whale
          away at MMA punching dummies and roll around on sweat-
          saturated mats. Sun slants through a dirty, industrial
          skylight. A no frills kind of gym.
                         
          Behind the front counter, FENROY (20s) rolls hand wraps and
          watches ESPN's "MMA LIVE" on a laptop.
                         
          ON COMPUTER SCREEN: ESPN ANCHOR JON ANIK INTERVIEWS PROMOTER

           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)
           And we return here on MMA Live, Jon
           Anik alongside billionaire fight
           promoter J.J. Riley. The Tapout
           crew is also here. Punk and Skrape
           are in the building. Now J.J., what
           led to this project that is
           redefining Mixed Martial Arts here
           in the States?
                         
           J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)
           Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport
           that I've always been incredibly
           passionate about. As for where the
           idea for Sparta came from, I've
           always kind of dug the Grand Prix
           format, so I tracked these guys
           down to help me out.
           9.
                         
                         
           PUNKASS (ON SCREEN)
           When J.J. came to us he said he
           wanted to create the Super Bowl of
           Mixed Martial Arts.
                         
           SKRAPE (ON SCREEN)
           And he decided to put up the five
           million dollar purse, too.
                         
           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)
           Well, there you have it. It shall
           be done. Hedge fund king J.J.
           Riley, going from the lion's den of
           Wall Street to the cage, promoting
           the biggest winner-take-all
           tournament in MMA history. Sparta.
                         
          As Fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming Sparta
          tournament, Tommy walks into the gym, surveys the room with
          curiosity, and approaches the front desk.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Fitzy still own this?
                         
                          FENROY
           Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns
           this gym.
                         
          Fenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices
          a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: "THE WAR ON THE SHORE.
          ATLANTIC CITY, JULY 2-3. BIGGEST WINNER TAKE ALL IN MMA
          HISTORY!"
                         
                          FENROY (CONT'D)
           Can I help you with something?
                         
                          TOMMY
           How's it work here?
                         
                          FENROY

           Sure.
                         
          Fenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the
          counter in front of Tommy.
                         
                          FENROY
           Put your name and contact info on

          INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          Brendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school
          STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain. A block of
          wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, TITO, stands over
          it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates
          CHEER him on.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in
           this too, OK? Listen up. So we have
           a body at rest, and you have the
           bat which needs--
                         
                          TITO
           Acceleration.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Acceleration, right. If you have
           enough acceleration, you have might
           have a chance to break the body at
           rest. OK. Go ahead.
                         
          Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face,
          watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS
          in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and
          leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF
          MOTION" printed on it.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           There we go. Alright Tito, well
           done. Remind not to mess with you.
           Sit down everybody. Dial it down.
                         
                         
          As Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things
          settle down and the kids take their seats.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           So, have we got it?
                         
          A room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of NASH, a
          skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey, standing out.
                         
                          NASH
           Force equals mass times
           acceleration. We got it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Alright. The third law--
                         
          A black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk.
           11.
                         
                         
                          STEPHON
           How many laws this dude got?
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (LAUGHING)
           The dude? The dude has three.
           Newton the dude says that for every
           action, there's an equal and
           opposite reaction.
                         
          Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and-
          white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to
          KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working
          a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           For example, if KC does not stop
           the action of sending texts in
           class...
                         
          Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly
          shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           ...and tell her posse outside to
           beat it...
                         
          He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the
          window.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           ...then my reaction might be to
           send her down to Principal Zito's
           office. Thus setting our world back
           in proper balance.
                         
                          KC
           Mr. C, I put it away.
                         
          The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and
          sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that
          he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Alright, before you go, I have your
           tests from last week.
                         
                         
          INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY
                         
          Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer.
          Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming
          Sparta tournament.
           12.
                         
                         
          Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag
          and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a
          heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s),
          is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious
          nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is
          somebody important.
                         
          In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning
          back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get
          up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands
          as Mad Dog laughs.
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Where do you find these girls?
                         
          Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter.
          Glances at Mad Dog.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           We got a tournament coming up. You
           gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh?
                          (TO FENROY)
           Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call
           that Puerto Rican kid, the one that
           fights outa the Bottoms. If he's
           here in 20 minutes, he gets 200
           bucks.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yo, I'll fight him.
                         
          Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who
          smiles down at him from inside the ring.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Do me a favor guy, go back to your
           bag. We don't need anybody else
           getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk.
                         
          Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's
          outfit.
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Yo Rock, what happened? You leave
           Mick and Paulie at home today?
                         
          Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.
                         
                          FENROY
                          (TO COLT)
           His phone's disconnected.
           13.
                         
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Then go through the list. Get me
           Joe Bones.
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (TO COLT)
           All I'm saying is if you need
           somebody to help you, I'm happy to
           keep your boy warm for you.
                         
          Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked
          fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           You ever fought before?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah.
                         
          Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
                          (TO FENROY)
           This guy sign a waiver?
                         
                          FENROY
           All good.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           What's your name?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Tommy.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           You get tuned up in here, it's on
           you, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Sure, no problem.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Come on in.
                         
          Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage
          starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays
          in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped
          out of the ring.
                         
          A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves.
          He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts
          moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and
          then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick
          to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
           14.
                         
                         
                          MAD DOG
           Gonna be a hero? Alright.
                         
          He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A
          leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he
          does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard
          right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his
          entourage and Colt Boyd.
                         
          Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring.
          Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing
          and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls
          it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.
                         
          Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll,
          striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls
          out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt
          Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against
          the ropes and blasts away.
                         
          Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going
          on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left
          hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.
                         
          SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The
          entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt
          Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and
          approaches him.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You owe me two hundred bucks.
                         
                         
          INT. FIRST UNION BANK - DAY
                         
          Brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer DAN TAYLOR
          (40s). They're mid-meeting and going over documents.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           This is the new appraisal figure,
           and this is how it effects the
           monthly. As you can see, that puts
           you upside down on your mortgage.
           That's the problem. It's the
           country that did the assessment,
           not the bank. So, the numbers are
           what they are, Mr. Conlon.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Brendan.
           15.
                         
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           The numbers are what they are,
           Brendan. I mean, you're a Math
           teacher, you can appreciate that.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I teach Physics.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Physics. OK. But the bank has got
           to go by the new appraisal figures.
           According to these figures, you're
           upside down on your mortgage--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You said that three times already.
           I get that. But I'm asking you if
           there's something else you can do.
           Not the bank, you. Can you shift
           things around, restructure--
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Well, you've already refinanced
           twice.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Because you advised us to do that.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           I presented you with that option.
           It was your choice.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm also showing you netted a
           substantial payout with the refi.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           We had that conversation. I was
           paying medical bills. Is that in
           your file?
                         
          Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Oh, right. Sorry. Your
           daughter's...kidney?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Heart.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Heart, right.
           (off stack of files on desk)
           Lot of stories.
           16.
                         
                         
          Brendan glares at him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           So my option is I've got no
           options? You're not even gonna try
           to help me?
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can
           get you 90 days to get even--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           90 days is not enough. My wife and
           I have three jobs between us and
           that doesn't cut it. So, what do
           you suggest?
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Let me ask you a question: have you
           considered bankruptcy? It's a
           viable option. There's no shame in
           it these days.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's not how I do things.
                         
                          DAN TAYLOR
           Well, then you're looking at
           foreclosure.
                         
          Brendan gets up and storms out of the office.

          Paddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE
          of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads:

           moments away from a high school
           state championship. And there it

          As Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the
          door as the tape continues to play.
                         
           ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
           Tommy told me that he's chasing the
           record of Theogenes, apparently a
           mythical Greek fighter said to be
           unbeaten in over 1400 bouts...
                         
          Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for
           Tommy Riordan.
                         
          Paddy registers the name "Riordan."
                         
                          PADDY
           Who?
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
                         
                          PADDY
           What business you got with Tommy?
           18.
                         
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           None yet. That's why I'm here. I
           manage fighters.
                         
          Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's
          obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.
                         
           COLT BOYD (CONT'D)
           Tommy's been working out at my gym.
           He put a beating on the number one
           middleweight contender in the world
           today. I want to know more about
           the guy. Maybe help him out. I have
           a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.
                         
                          PADDY
           Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything
           you want to know about Tommy, you
           gotta ask him yourself.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           I'm just looking for some general
           information here.
                         
                          PADDY
           Like I said, anything you want to
           know about Tommy, you gotta ask him
           yourself.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Look, I don't mean to interrupt
           your night. He put this address
           down when he signed up at the gym.
                         
                          PADDY
           He doesn't live here.
                         
          Paddy closes the door on a frustrated Colt.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan drives down the road on the outskirts of town and
          talks on his cell.
                         
           BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)
           Listen kiddo, I need you put Mommy
           back on, OK? I love you.
                          (BEAT)
           Hey. I'm just pulling in. Huh? Oh,
           they've got this open mic night
           thing. Should be a quiet one. Sleep
           well. You too. Bye.
           19.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE TENDER TRAP - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan pulls into the parking lot of the local strip club. A
          white TENT is set up outside, and the parking lot is
          overflowing with cars. Something big going on.
                         
                         
          INT. TENDER TRAP TENT - SAME
                         
          Aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring, where TWO
          AMATEUR FIGHTERS go at it under a bank of sodium lights.
          Hundreds of rowdy LOCALS swill beer and BOO lustily when the
          action slows.
                         
                         
          INT. TENDER TRAP RING - LATER
                         
          MIKE MOORE (20s), a FIGHTER sporting sleeves of demonic ink,
          paces in his corner as a cluster of BIKERS cheer him on from
          ringside. An ANNOUNCER walks to the center of the ring with a
          cordless microphone.
                         
                          ANNOUNCER
           It's time for our next contest!
           Introducing first, fighting out of
           the red corner, from Ripley, West
           Virginia, please welcome Mike "The
           Mutilator" Moore!
                         
          Some hollers from the crowd.
                         
                          ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
           And in the blue corner. He fights
           out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
           Please welcome "Irish" Brendan
           Conlon!

          Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the
          corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right
          shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.
                         
                          ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
           This bout is scheduled for three
           five-minute rounds, and when the
           action begins your referee is Mr.
           Rick Fike.
                         
          The REFEREE enters the ring and stands between Brendan and
          Mike Moore.
           20.
                         
                         
                          REFEREE
           Fighters to the center! I want you
           to obey my commands at all times.
           If you have no questions, touch
           gloves, back up, and wait for my
           signal. Come out fighting!
                         
          Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his
          opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means
          business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to
          his corner.
                         
                          REFEREE (CONT'D)
           Fighters, are you ready? Let's go!
                         
          The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out
          bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets
          caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles
          back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at
          him with his huge hands.
                         
          Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the
          legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding
          THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching
          skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts
          raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face
          and body.
                         
          It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,
          mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture
          of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.
                         
          A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his
          head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs
          out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.
                         
                          PROMOTER
           Nice fight. Two more wins and you
           take home the bacon.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The bedroom door opens and Brendan creeps through the room
          and into the bathroom.
                         
                         
          INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BATHROOM - SAME
                         
          It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the
          window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins
          washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess
          shuffles in.
           21.
                         
                         
                          TESS
                          (SLEEPY)
           Hey babe. How was work?
                         
          Brendan doesn't answer. Tess slowly wakes up. As she does,
          she gets a look at his face.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. What happened? You said
           it was going to be a slow night.
                         
          Tess studies his face. Brendan looks at her. Reaches into his
          pocket and hands her $500 in cash.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm not bouncing at a club.
                         
                          TESS
           What do you mean you're not
           bouncing?
                         
          She looks at him. Looks at the money. Puts it together.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           You've been lying to me?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I went in to apply. They were only
           paying nine bucks an hour. Then I
           saw a sign for this other thing.
                         
          Tess can't believe what she's hearing.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           They're putting us out of the house
           in three months, we're running out
                          OF OPTIONS--
                         
                          TESS
                          (FURIOUS)
           Then they'll put us out of the
           house in three months. I'd rather
           go back to the old apartment than
           see you in the back of an ambulance
           again.
                          (BEAT)
           I thought we agreed that we weren't
           going to raise our children in
           a family where their father gets
           beat up for a living.
           22.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           We're not giving up the house. This
           is our home. We're not going
                          BACKWARDS
                         
          Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself
          down. Embraces her husband.
                         
                          TESS
           We'll figure it out. But this is
           what we're not going back to.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING
                         
          A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the
          shadow of the railroad tracks.
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - SAME
                         
          Paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by
          the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich,
          he's been there a while.
                         
          The front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch
          cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops
          himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he
          doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him.
                         
                          PADDY
           You wanted to talk?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm gonna start fighting.
                         
                          PADDY
           That right?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Don't play babe in the woods with
           me. I know that guy from the gym
           came to see you.
                         
                          PADDY
           Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him
           anything, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           We wouldn't be sitting here now if
           you did.
           23.
                         
                         
          Tommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Alright. Look. There's this
           tournament. A big tournament. Top
           sixteen middleweights in the world.
           Single elimination. Winner take all
           for a lot of money. I'm gonna do
           that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm
           gonna need a trainer. Now that much
           you were good at.
           (off Paddy grinning)
           No, no, no. This doesn't mean
           anything.
                         
          Paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at
          him sternly.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           I'm serious. We train. That's it. I
           don't wanna hear a word about
           anything but training, you
           understand? You wanna tell your war
           stories, you can take `em down to
           the VFW. You can take `em to a
           meeting, or church, or wherever the
           hell it is you go nowadays.
                         
                          PADDY
           What about Colt Boyd?
                         
                          TOMMY
           What about him? I told him I don't
           train with people I don't know.
                         
                          PADDY
           Ah, the devil you know.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Excuse me?
                         
                          PADDY
           The devil you know is better than
           the devil you don't.
                         
          Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda
           like old times.
           24.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (ANGRY)
           I just told you, this doesn't mean
           anything. You get that through your
           skull right now or I'm walking.
                         
          Paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a
          stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left.
                         
                          PADDY
           Alright. Alright. But you get
           something through your skull, too.
           You called me. So don't go
           threatening to walk every five
           minutes. And since this is about
           training, you dump whatever it is
           you need to dump as far as those
           pills are concerned. I don't want
           to see `em.
                         
          Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy
          away.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           In fact, hand `em over right now.
                          (BEAT)
           I know they're on you, Tommy. You
           sounded like a goddamn maraca
           coming through the door.
                         
          Tommy considers, then reaches into his pocket and slides two
          bottles across the table.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           That's not gonna do.
                          (SHAKING BOTTLES)
           When you came through that door it
           was chhh-chhh-chhh.
           (holding up 3 fingers)
           Three.
                         
          Tommy looks at him. Fishes another bottle out of his pocket
          and flips it on the table.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)

           And another thing, you don't eat
           crap like this. This is for losers
           and old men.

           And we're gonna have to bunk up. If
           we're gonna do this right, you
           gotta stay at the house.

           I watch your diet, we follow the
           old regimen. You copy?
                         
          The two men stare at each other. Tommy looks furious, but he
          doesn't get up. A silent, tenuous agreement is reached.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Copy.
                         
                         
          INT. CENTRAL HIGH HALLWAY - MORNING
                         
          Brendan, his face BRUISED badly from the night before, walks
          down the hallway toward his classroom. STUDENTS watch him as
          he passes and whisper.
                         
                         
          INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME
                         
          The class is filled with the kind of BUZZING that can only
          rise off a major rumor. Tito, Nash, KC, and Stephon discuss.
                         
                          TITO
           My brother said he was at the strip
           club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---
                         
                          NASH
           What's MMA?
                         
                          STEPHON
           Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different
           styles of fighting.
                         
                          KC
           Your brother's a liar.
                         
          Brendan enters the room. The kids look at him. Holy shit.
          It's true.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Take your seats.
                         
          Brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class. He
          is not amused by the murmuring in there.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Now, please.
                         
          The kids pipe down. Then Tito speaks up.
           26.
                         
                         
                          TITO
           Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the
           titty bar last night and said you
           was choking brothers out. What's
           up? Is it true?
                         
                          STEPHON
           Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really
           work on some fools or something?
                         
                          KC
           You have to tell us.
                         
          Before Brendan can answer, he sees PRINCIPAL JOE ZITO (50s)
          gesturing to him through the window of the classroom. Zito
          taps his watch and points. Come see me after class.
                         
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - LATER
                         
          Zito, puffy faced, hair getting thinner by the hour, hangs up
          his phone as Brendan pokes his head in. Zito waves him in.
          Eyeballs the marks on his face.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Are you being literal or
           figurative? Because literally it
           looks bad. And figuratively it
           looks even worse. The
           superintendent's coming by in a few
           minutes. So gimme a little help
           here, Brendan. Can you explain to
           me what the hell you were doing?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I need the money, Joe.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Yeah, but we can't have this. This
           isn't moonlighting at Applebee's
           for Christ's sake.
                         
          Zito stands up and runs his hands across his head.
                         
           JOE ZITO (CONT'D)
           Shit, Brendan. Leaving everything
           else aside, which we can't, are you
           out of your mind? You're gonna get
           yourself killed. I mean, you're a
           goddamn teacher.

           You've got no business in the ring

                          BRENDAN
           Actually, I used to be one of those
           animals.
                         
          Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I fought for a living.

           Yeah, I guess you did.
                         
          Zito sits back down.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Listen, the school district's not
           going to tolerate school teachers
           cockfighting in strip clubs.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It was the parking lot of a strip
           club.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Wherever it was, you can't be doing
           it, alright? I mean this is a
           serious--shit, he's here.
                         
          Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his
          office. He's looking none too pleased.
                         
           JOE ZITO (CONT'D)

          Brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom,
          putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the
          bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom.
          They speak in whispers.
                         
                          TESS

           They're gonna review your case at
           the end of the semester, but until
           then you're suspended without pay.
           Joe gave me the number of his
           attorney.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           How the hell are we gonna pay for
           an attorney?
                         
          Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the
          floor.
                         
                          TESS
           He talked to me for free. As a
           favor to Joe.

           He said there's no precedent for
           this. You'll be back by next
           semester.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Next semester?
                         
          Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions.
          Finally, Brendan speaks up.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Look, Tess. They have these smoker
           fights all over. There's one in
           Lancaster next week. There's two in
           Dover the week after. Wilmington.
           Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us

                          TESS
           You're gonna put yourself through
           this over and over, for five
           hundred bucks a pop?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Some of them pay a little more than
           that.

          Brendan looks at his wife.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           And these guys, they're not real
           fighters. They're just guys who
           have seen too much UFC on TV. If
           you have a better solution, I'm all
           ears.
                         
          Tess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options.
                         
                          TESS
           What are we gonna tell the girls?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It'll be fine. I'll just leave the
           house as usual, except now I'll be
           going to the gym.
                         
          They look at each other. No choice. This is the plan.

          Paddy climbs the stairs with a POSTER BOARD tucked under his
          arm and a cup of coffee in his hands. He enters Tommy's room,
          which is also a monument to the past. Old wrestling TROPHIES,
          Steelers' posters, and an EMPTY SECOND BED that obviously
          once belonged to Brendan.

           doodle-doo.
                         
          Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy
          stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster.
          It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting.

           can fill me in on how close you got
           to that record.
                         
          Tommy says nothing. Not a nostalgic bone in his body. The
          dreams on that poster are long gone.

           Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You
           can take that thing back to where
           you found it. And you can leave the

          MARINES of various rank huddle around a computer screen,
          fired up about something they're watching.
                         
                          MARINE #1
           Damn dude, that's brutal.
                         
          LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD (20s) walks up to see what the
          commotion is all about.

           Who's "Mad Dog" Grimes?
                         
                          MARINE #2
           Shit, Bradford. The stuff you don't
           know amazes me.
                          (OFF COMPUTER)

          Bradford stares at the screen, his eyes widening as the
          Marines raise hell about the footage.
                         
                          BRADFORD
           Wait, rewind that.
                         
          One of the Marines rewinds the video. Bradford looks at the
          image in disbelief, then races out of the tent.

          Bradford enters a barracks, where Private "AV" SIMERS (20s)
          plays cards with other MARINES.
                         
                          BRADFORD
           AV, I need to see the tape!

                          BRADFORD
           The tape.
                         
          AV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel
          container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They
          are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for,
          loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY.

          AV holds the "Pause" button down as Bradford looks at the
          screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy.

          In a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with
          Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS.
          The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air.
                         
                          FRANK
           Let the music sink in to you. This
           is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
                         
          As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great
          trainer notices him and walks over.

           You see this beast? Marco Santos?
           I'm training him for Sparta.

           Come on back.
                         
          The two head for the offices at the back of the gym.

          They walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his
          fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also
          adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini-
          fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He
          hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down.
                         
                          FRANK
           You look good, brother. How're the
           girls?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Good. Good. I had another little
           one. Rosie.
                         
                          FRANK
           I know. Johnny C. told me she was
           in the hospital for a bit. I was
           gonna call, but then time went by.
           I don't know. I'm a piece of shit.
           I should have called.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's alright.
                         
                          FRANK
           No, Brendan. I'm sorry.

           It's all good. She's good now.
                         
          Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly.
                         
                          FRANK
           It's great to see you, man. So
           everything's going good?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah. Well, I've got a little
           problem. The guys at the bank want
           to take my house away. That's kind
           of why I came to see you, actually.
                         
          Frank considers what he's hearing.
                         
                          FRANK
           I've got most of my dough tied up
           in this joint, but how much do you
           need?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I didn't come here for a loan,
           Frank.
                          (BEAT)
           I was hoping you'd train me.
                         
                          FRANK
           Train you for what?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I want to get back in the cage.
                         
          Frank starts smiling. Leans back in his seat. Then he sees
          Brendan is not smiling with him.
                         
                          FRANK
           You're serious?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I just won an event the other
           night.
                         
                          FRANK
           Ah, you won an event.
           (off bruised face)
           That's what this is. Let me guess,
           it was in a parking lot. DJ from
           the local radio station. Couple of
           ring card girls you wouldn't bang
           on a dare. Am I right?
                         
          Brendan smiles.
           35.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Ish.
                         
                          FRANK
           Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But
           why would I train you? When you
           were in shape and on the right side
           of 30 you were barely a .500
           fighter. You never listened to me.
           You never listened to anyone. These
           guys are animals. I mean, you're a
           teacher, right? What're you gonna
           do? You're gonna come down here for
           a couple days a week after
           detention? You're gonna skip out of
           the girl's volleyball game early?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I've got loads of time. Time's not
           an issue. The parking lot thing
           kinda got me suspended. I need to
           keep working the smokers.
                         
                          FRANK
           Tess know about this?
           (off Brendan's nod)
           Yeah? `Cause the last time you
           fought, I got read the riot act
           sitting in a hospital waiting room.
           You remember that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           No. I was unconscious.
                         
          The two friends share a laugh.
                         
                          FRANK
           She's not gonna come down here with
           the two puppies, screaming at
           Frank?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's not gonna happen. Come on.
           Whattya say, Frank?
                         
                          FRANK
           What do I say? What am I gonna say
           to you? No? I mean, all my time is
           wrapped up with Marco. You come
           down, I'll throw you in the
           rotation, you spar with these guys,
           no problem. But I can't promise you
           much more than that, Brendan.
           36.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's all I need.
                         
          Brendan stands up. Shakes Frank's hand.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I appreciate it.
                         
                          FRANK
           Let me know when you're coming
           down.
                         
                          BRENDAN
                          (WALKING AWAY)
           Well, I'm just gonna go get my
           stuff from the car.
                         
                          FRANK
           Now?
                         
          Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his
          head.
                         
                         
          EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out
          of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands
          outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door.
                         
          Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's
          clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there,
          uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street
          lamp.
                         
                          PADDY
           Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What're you doing here?
                         
                          PADDY
           I have some news for you.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Something wrong with your hands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           If there's nothing wrong with your
           hands then there's no reason for
           you not to phone. That's the deal.

                          PADDY
           Yeah, I forgot--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
                         
          Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.
                         
                          PADDY
           Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my
           hands so steady? Have you?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm going inside.
                         
                          PADDY
           I've got a thousand days. A
           thousand days sober today.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, that's great, Pop. But it
           doesn't change anything.
                         
                          PADDY
           What do you mean it doesn't change
           anything? Have a heart, Brendan.
                         
          Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen
          before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You listen to me. You take your
           have-a-heart bullshit and you run
           it down the road. Run it out on
           someone who doesn't know you like I
           do.
                         
                          PADDY
           C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we
           could break bread. Open some lines
           of communication.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You got two lines of communication,
           the telephone and the post office.
           Just because you decide it's a
           special day, it doesn't make it one
           for me. I got a wife and kids
           inside and they're waiting for me,
           so I don't have time for whatever
           this is.
           38.
                         
                         
                          PADDY
           I know you got a wife and kids in
           there. I got a grand-daughter I
           haven't seen in three years and
           another I haven't even ever met.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do
           you remember having anything to do
           with that?
                         
          Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           That shit you pulled. Never again.
           And all the shit I saw growing up?
           That doesn't happen here.
                         
          Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on
          his face. Then he heads for the house.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Take care of yourself.
                         
          As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out.
                         
                          PADDY
           Tommy's back.
                         
          Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           He's in the `Burgh.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
                         
                          PADDY
           He came to see me.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           He came to see you?
                         
                          PADDY
           He's over at the house. We're doing
           a little training at Fitzy's.
           Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's
           anymore.
                         
          Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You and Tommy are training
           together?
           39.
                         
                         
          Paddy nods.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tommy Conlon.
                         
                          PADDY
           Riordan. He's using your mother's
           maiden name now.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I know what her name is.
                         
                          PADDY
           I thought you'd want to know he's
           back. That's why I drove all the
           way over here.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I thought you came to break bread
           over a thousand days?
                         
                          PADDY
           That too.
                         
          Brendan looks at him. Considers.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Did he say if he wants to see me?
                         
                          PADDY
           He doesn't say much. He's just not
           that happy kid he was.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Wow, look at you. Mister inside
           man.
                         
          Paddy frowns.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           You and Tommy training together
           like nothing ever happened. This is
           unbelievable. Now I know what
           you're really doing here.
                         
                          PADDY
           What's that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You came to gloat.
                         
                          PADDY
           I did not come to gloat. I came to
           get my son back.
           40.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Well, there you go. You got your
           son back.
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm talking about you, Bren--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You got your son back.
                         
          Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           You know, part of the reason I
           stuck around was `cause I thought
           I'd finally get you all to myself.
           But you didn't have any interest in
           training me. Tommy was the one.
                         
                          PADDY
           Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean,
           you know. I'm sorry.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Forget it. You were always a front
           runner. You never had any interest
           in underdogs. But I was your son.
                         
                          PADDY
           You are my son.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Am I?
                         
                          PADDY
           Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you
           to find just a little space in your
           heart to forgive me.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I
           do not trust you. Tell Tommy this
           is where I am if he wants to see
           me.
                         
                          PADDY
           Alright. But they're not different
           things. You've gotta trust to
                          FORGIVE--
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Goodnight, Pop.
           41.
                         
                         
          Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess
          stand at the door. Paddy waves.
                         
                          PADDY
           My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's
           grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?
                         
          Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.
                         
                          ROSIE
           Daddy, who is that?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Just some nice old man.
                         
          Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone
          in the yard.

          Tommy, his hoodie drenched, jogs up the sidewalk and enters
          the gym.

          Fenroy watches "MMA LIVE" on his computer as Tommy walks in
          the door and heads into the gym.

           Huge news breaking here at ESPN.
           Koba is coming to America and will
           fight at Sparta. Universally
           considered to be the greatest pound
           for pound fighter that ever lived,
           the mighty, mythical Russian has
           never fought on U.S. soil in his
           legendary career...
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of
          Colt Boyd. When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his
          attention away from Mad Dog.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got
           you into Sparta. Took some doing,
           but I made it happen..
           (off no reaction from Tommy)
           Thank you and 10 percent is

          Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without
          acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to
          crease his lips.

          More of a shack than a house. PILAR FERNANDEZ (20s), a pretty
          but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year-
          old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The
          table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another
          MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi
          desert.

           Bueno?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Pilar. It's Tommy.
                         
                          PILAR
           Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe
           it! How are you?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Good good. How you doin'?
                         
                          PILAR
           OK. You know me, Tommy.
                          (BEAT)
           I was getting really worried about
           you.
                         
                          TOMMY
           How're things? Kids are good?
                         
                          PILAR
           They're good. Maria's getting so
           big. She looks more like Manny
           every day.
                         
                          TOMMY
           How's little man?

                          PILAR
           He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.
           Takes care of his sister. He's a
           great kid. Everyone's good.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You know, Pilar, I haven't
           forgotten for one minute what I
           promised you. What I promised
           Manny. I've got an opportunity
           coming up to help you guys out. To
           take care of you guys.

           Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know
           Manny would really appreciate it.
           You worry too much. It's OK. We're
           hanging in there.

           J.J., we've never seen this kind of
           Grand Prix tournament in the
           country before. Tell us, why the
           unique format?
                         
           J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN)
           Well, Jon, you know as well as
           anyone that in Mixed Martial Arts,
           anyone can beat anyone on a given
           night...

          Brendan takes steady blows from an OPPONENT in another
          smoker, then turns the tables, slams his man down, and chokes
          him out. His skills are improving.
                         
           J.J. RILEY (V.O.)
           ...but with this type of format,
           it's gonna be tough to deny who the
           champion is.

          In an expansive and grim scrap yard along the river bank,
          Tommy somehow manages to lift and flip old long-haul rig
          tires. They're roughly the size of hot tubs. His strength is
          astonishing.
                         
           J.J. RILEY (V.O.)
           You've got four fights in two
           nights, sixteen fighters down to

           standing.

           JON ANIK (ON SCREEN)
           Only five weeks left `til Sparta
           and the hype continues for the War
           on the Shore. Fourth of July
           weekend in Atlantic City and you
           know what that means: the great
           Koba, bringing his act stateside.
           Let me ask you about the other
           guys. What are they thinking
           entering a winner take all
           tournament against a guy that
           seemingly can't be beat?
                         
           RASHOD EVANS (ON SCREEN)
           They're thinking five million
           dollars, and five million dollars
           is a lot of money, but they've
           gotta remember one thing: they're
           going against Koba. Mission
           impossible. Game over. Go home.
                         
          Tess comes back down the stairs and looks at the screen,

           Mad Dog Grimes. Mad Dog, what is

           You set the rhythm. Feel the

           More patient. Wait for him to make
           a mistake. And when he does, that's
           your moment.
                         
          Brendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar. Marco has
          nowhere to go and is forced to TAP. Frank jumps in the ring,
          all smiles, and slaps Brendan on the chest.
                         
                          FRANK
           No he did not tap you! Physics

          garage with Brendan.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
                         
                          FRANK
           Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta
           call the boys and break the news.
           I'll call you tomorrow.
                         
          Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car,
          stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward
          him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a

           Marco. But what about me?
                         
          Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he
          begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.
                         
                          FRANK
           You talking about Sparta? Brendan,
           please. You got a better chance of
           starting a boy band. I'll talk to
           you tomorrow.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's a grand prix tournament. Which
           means anything can happen. You know
           that as well as I do.
                         
          Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           They'll have to kill me to get me
           out of that cage.
                         
                          FRANK
           That's what I'm afraid of.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Frank, I need this. You're real
           tight with those guys. You call
           them, they'll listen to you.

                          FRANK
           You realize what you're asking me
           to do here, Brendan? We go down to
           AC and you get tapped out in five
           seconds, how does that benefit
           either one of us?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's not gonna happen.
                         
                          FRANK
           Not gonna happen. Wish I had a
           nickel for every time I heard that.

          Frank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no?
                         
                          FRANK
           I'll make a call.
                         
          Brendan grins and walks back toward his car.

          out of the house talking on a cordless PHONE.
                         
           TESS (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, the girls are good. They're
           good. Yeah, you should. You've been
           spending so much time with Brendan
           these days it's like you're part of
           the family or something. Yeah, he's
           right here.
           (handing phone to Brendan)
           It's your boyfriend.
                         
           BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)
           Hey Frank.
                          (BEAT)
           That's unbelievable. I can't thank
           you enough. I don't know what to
           say. Alright, listen, I've gotta
           call you back. Alright, bye.
                         
          Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess.
           50.
                         
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I'm in. I'm going.
                         
          A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her
          hands on her hips.
                         
                          TESS
           Really? So that's your decision?
           You decided? `Cause I really
           enjoyed that conversation we just
           had about making that decision
           together.
                         
          Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that
          he's about to get laid into.
                         
                          TESS (CONT'D)
           You told me you were gonna fight
           guys that watched too much UFC. I
           saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's
           the guy they're watching.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           It's a lot of money, Tess.
                         
                          TESS
           I don't give a shit about the
           money, Brendan. I told you that.
           We're gonna end up cashing in your
           life insurance policy before we
           pick up that prize money.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You don't think I can do it.
                         
                          TESS
           I think you can get killed.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm not gonna get killed.
                         
                          TESS
           Fine, you're not going to get
           killed. But can you promise me
           you're not going to get hurt?
           You're not gonna end up in the
           hospital? You're not gonna end up
           paralyzed? We'll have no prize
           money. No house. Payments for

                          BRENDAN
           Tess, I can promise you this: if I
           don't try, they're gonna take the
           house. How's that for a promise?
                         
          No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd
           really love it if you'd be with me
           on this.
                         
          Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't.
                         
                          TESS
           I'm not gonna watch you fight
           again. I'm not.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
                         
          Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the
          lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front
          of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard.
          Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta.

          Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and
          boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the
          majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is

          BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are
          everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam
          Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The
          greatest show on earth has hit the shore.

          LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as
          "Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane"
          Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red
          carpet swarming with FANS.
                         
          In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and
          guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd,
          and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN
          (40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.

           J.J., you've made a fortune with
           your hedge funds, yet you turned
           your back on Wall Street and
           dedicated your life to making
           Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this
           tournament so important to you?
                         
           J.J. RILEY
           Growing up, we all wanted to know
           who the toughest kid in the
           neighborhood was, right? I wanna
           know who the toughest man on the
           planet is. That's why I put this
           together, that's what all these
           people are here to see, and come
           Saturday night, that's what we're
           gonna find out.

           Thank you, J.J. And here's
           something fans never thought they'd
           see: Koba is here! The legend
           arriving to fight on U.S. soil for
           the very first time...
                         
          The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo,
          trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS.
          FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie
          premiere out there and Koba's the star.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME
                         
          As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews
          stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of
          the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments
          later, Brendan comes walking through the doors.
                         
          As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make
          eye contact.
           53.
                         
                         
          They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the
          looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each
          other today. Paddy is just as shocked.
                         
          Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by
          Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside.
                         
                          FRANK
           Hey. Where'd you go? You can't
           leave me like that. They wanna talk
           to you, not me.
                         
          Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward
          the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him.

          Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and
          looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to "Moby

          Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite
          and stares at the TV.
                         
           BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D)
           I couldn't have had more than
           another minute. Suddenly the back
           ramp gets ripped off, and there he
           was. Before I could get out and
           thank him, he was gone. He just
           vanished like a ghost.
                         
          Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him
          and back at the TV before heading toward the door.

          Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean
          lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle
          rockets trace through the night sky.
                         
          In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash
          and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements
          for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS.
                         
          Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward
          him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each
          other warily.
                         
                          BRENDAN

                          BRENDAN
           I was thinking maybe we could grab

                          TOMMY
           I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You don't want to go sit down
           somewhere?

          Brendan looks at Tommy. Sees how rigid he is. A long silence.
          Finally Brendan cuts right to it.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to
           know I was never gonna see you guys
           again?
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were briefed. You had the
           information. You chose the old man
           and the girl.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           She wasn't some girl. I married
           her. She's my wife.
                         
          Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent
          Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           (handing Tommy the picture)
           That's Tess. And that's Emily and
           Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
                         
          Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Don't know `em.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I know you don't know them. Of
           course you don't know them.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Why am I looking at pictures of
           people I don't know?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Because that's my family.
                         
                          TOMMY
           And who are you exactly?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm your brother, man.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were in the Corps?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           What?
           57.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           I said I didn't know you were in
           the Corps.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I wasn't in the Corps.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Then you ain't no brother to me. My
           brother was in the Corps.
                         
          With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the
          beach. His brother runs after him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old
           kid. What the hell did I know?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I don't know what you know. Why
           don't you go ask your girlfriend
           about it?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it?
           I stay with Tess and I never get to
           see you guys again? Not a single
           phone call? Nothing?
                         
          No response from Tommy. He's a wall.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           God, man, I don't understand this.
           You won't forgive me, but you'll
           forgive Pop?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Shit. He's just some old vet I
           train with. He means nothing to me.
           From what I hear he means nothing
           to you, either, so you got balls
           talking about forgiveness.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           That's got nothing to do with
           forgiveness. I've got a family to
           protect. Everything I do is for
           them.
                         
          Tommy smirks. Walks away again.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           But I forgave Pop. Just like I
           forgave you and Mom.
           58.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (TURNING AROUND)
           You forgave us?
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Yeah.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm not surprised you made the
           tournament, Brendan. You got some
           stones.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I fell in love, Tommy. What the
           hell was I supposed to do?
                         
                          TOMMY
           You were supposed to stick to the
           plan. You were supposed to come
           with us. Mom needed you. I needed
           you. You were my big brother and
           you bailed on me.
                         
          The words hit Brendan hard.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Hey, I'm glad you stayed and
           everything worked out for you,
           Brendan. See, you leave, you get
           the opposite. You leave, you get to
           bury people.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           You're not the only one who
           suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know
           she was sick. I never even got the
           chance to say goodbye to my own
           mother. You had no right to keep
           that from me! That was not your
           decision to make!
                         
                          TOMMY
           You know what? You walk around with
           your pictures in your wallet and
           you're all, I forgive you, I
           forgive Pop. I forgive everyone.
           But you know what? You're full of
           shit.
                         
          Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing
          on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for
          a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.
           59.
                         
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Are we done, Brendan? Are we
           finished?
                         
          Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity.
          Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say.
          Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY
                         
          Sunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot.

          Nash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's
          quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around.
          After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand
          up and head into the Principal's office.

                          JOE ZITO

           actually in session, right?
                         
          All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to
          something.

                          JOE ZITO
           Let me get this straight. You want
           to use the auditorium to watch a
           suspended teacher engage in the
           activity he was suspended for? Am I
           hearing this correctly?
                          (BEAT)

           enough.
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           It's never gonna happen.
                         
                          STEPHON
           What if we get a petition?
                         
                          TITO
           Yeah. We'll get the whole school to
           sign it.
                         
                          NASH
           The power of democracy!
                         
                          JOE ZITO
           Look, I appreciate that you guys
           love your teacher. I really do. But
           there is nothing I can do for you.
                         
          Zito turns and heads back to his desk. The kids, dejected,
          leave the office and walk off down the hallway.

          The Goodyear BLIMP, "SPARTA IS HERE" blinking on it, floats
          over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above
          Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats
          bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them.
                         
          THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their
          necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In
          the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a
          distance, the excitement and energy are palpable.

           Tommy Riordan's captured the
           media's attention, but the question
           still remains: who is this guy? And
           more importantly, can he compete in

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew
           who he was, and I've gotta say the
           fact that I don't know is strange.
           In an internet age where there are
           no secrets, this guy is a complete
           mystery. I can't find out anything
           about him. Tommy Riordan is
           officially Google proof.
                         
          Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and
          focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with
          Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight.

           You gotta love this guy, Sam. No
           walk out music, no sponsors, no
           interviews. He skipped out on the
           press conference. Wouldn't have his
           picture take for the program. He's
           breaking every rule!

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           The only reason that Tommy is even
           in this tournament is because of a
           video showing him beating up Mad
           Dog Grimes in the gym.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           But the reason a lot of his fans
           are in the stands is because of
           another video, which is even more
           stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes
           video. Let me describe it for you
           folks for the few who haven't seen
           it, and I don't know anyone who
           hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped
           the door off a tank in the heat of
           battle, saving lives in the
           process, and then walked away
           without claiming a medal. He ripped
           the door off a tank!
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Tommy Riordan is a genuine war
           hero, I'm not taking anything away
           from the guy. He's a very, very
           tough guy, Bryan, but the tank
           don't hit back. We've seen YouTube
           sensations fail on the big stage
           before.
                         
          Tommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his
          face. He looks like he's ready to murder someone.

           Tommy Riordan definitely has his
           hands full in his first opponent,
           Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is
           nothing to scoff at.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Yeah, he's the real deal. Very
           tough guy. Very high caliber
           fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of
           nowhere, and I imagine he's going
           to disappear just as quickly.

                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you've been given your
           instructions. I expect a clean
           fight. Obey my commands at all
           times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms
          wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible
          for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give
          him some advice, but Tommy is not listening.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           We're about to get the big answer
           to the big question: is Tommy
           Riordan for real? And here we go!
                         
          The bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Barbosa's gonna be looking for a
           take down.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Definitely gonna be looking for a
           take down.
                         
          There will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then
          levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The
          Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying,
          and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been
           knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most
           definitely for real!
                         
          As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's
          corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage
          without waiting for an official announcement.

          On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco
          Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of
          CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who
          smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders.
                         
                          FRANK

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours
           to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he

           of Frank Campana.

           quite frankly is something I just
           don't understand.
                         
          Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena,
          where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck.
          Brendan notices the old man as he approaches.
                         
                          PADDY
           Go get `em, son.
                         
          Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank
          looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression.
          As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven
          continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           I can understand coming out to no
           music, by why in the world would
           you choose classical music for your
           entrance?

           This is Beethoven, Bryan. This is
           Ode to Joy.

           You want to talk about renaissance
           men, you gotta talk about Frank
           Campana. Very unorthodox trainer,
           and one of the best in the game.
           He's well known for using classical
           music to train his fighters to
           remain calm, to remain patient, and
           to remain composed under pressure.
                         
          Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and toward
          cageside, where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat.

           When the brackets were announced,

          Josh Rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the
          cage for instructions.

          attack.

          Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to
          escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a
          rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and
          squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps.

          Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses
          to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd
          can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight
          Le, who slams the canvas in frustration.
                         
          As Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected
          him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a
          smiling Frank.

          across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan.

          Midnight continues pounding on Brendan, but Brendan starts
          giving back, working a few leg kicks of his own. He seems to
          be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of
          encouragement as the battle continues.
                         
          Back and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right
          hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots
          in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses
          position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the
          ground. The crowd is on its collective feet.

          Tommy climbs into the cage. A Mexican fighter, DIEGO SANTANA
          (20s), is waiting for him. Josh Rosenthal points at both men.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?

          The bell RINGS and Tommy goes right after Santana and starts
          administering a beating. He bullies him into the cage and
          starts raining BLOWS all over him.

          The arena is on its collective feet CHANTING "Tommy! Tommy!
          Tommy!" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the
          darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades.

          INT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME
                         
          A CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens.
          Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds
          coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines.
                         
          From a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of
          a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically
          feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the
          lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who
          doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          PADDY
           Can't sleep, huh?
                         
          Tommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits
          down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           I know that other thing's bothering
           the hell out of you, but I'm proud
           of you. What you did for that kid
           in the tank? That was really
           something.
                         
                          TOMMY
           How about deserting my unit? Is
           that really something, too? Yeah. I
           was on my way outta country when I
           came across those guys. What was I
           supposed to do, let `em drown?
                         
                          PADDY
           No.
                          (BEAT)
           What'd you do?

           What'd I do? I took off.
                         
          Paddy starts putting things together.
                         
                          PADDY
           That's why you go by Riordan.
           That's why the press can't find
           your service records.
                         
          Tommy doesn't respond.

                          TOMMY
           That is none of your business.
                         
                          PADDY
           Come on, kiddo. I've been there.
           I've done it. I've seen it. You can
           trust me. I'll understand.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Spare me the compassionate father
           routine, Pop. The suit don't fit.
                         
                          PADDY
           I'm really trying here, Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           You're trying? Now? Where were you
           when it mattered? I needed this guy
           back when I was a kid. I don't need
           you now. It's too late now.
           Everything's already happened. You
           and Brendan don't seem to
           understand that. Let me explain
           something to you: the only thing I
           have in common with Brendan Conlon
           is that we have absolutely no use
           for you.
                         
          Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he
          knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well
          up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I
           think I liked you better when you
           were a drunk. At least you had some
           balls then. Not like now. Tip
           toeing around like some beggar with
           your cup out. Take it somewhere
           else, old man.
                         
          Tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for
          holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with
          QUARTERS.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           In fact, you know what? Here's a
           cup. Why don't you take this and go
           buy some more of your shitty tapes?
                          (MORE)
           80.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Go back to the room and listen to
           some more fish stories no one gives
           a shit about. Go on, get outta
           here.
                          (BEAT)
           Get the fuck outta here!
                         
          Tommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS
          into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his
          face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at
          Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his
          slot machine as his destroyed father limps away.

          Fourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
                         
          Paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck,
          clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. "Moby Dick"
          plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off.
          LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen
          off the wagon. Hard.
                         
                          PADDY
           God pity `em! All shall perish
           except me! You bastards! Stop the
           ship, you bastards!
                         
          He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to
          no audience.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the
           ship! Please stop the ship!
           Somebody help `em!
                         
          Suddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair
          disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man
          thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch!
                         
          Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face
          blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The
          monster from the past.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           You stop the ship, you Godless
           sonofabitch!
           81.
                         
                         
          There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man
          and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles
          to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue
          is heard coming from the earphones.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship.
           For the love of God. We're lost.
                         
          The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           Please stop the ship.
                         
          Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at
          him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion
          on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries
          the whiskey bottle from his hand
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
           We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy.
           We'll never make it back.
                         
          Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms
          around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a
          tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to
          relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.
                         
                          PADDY (CONT'D)
                          (MUMBLING)
           I always loved you. You know that,
           don't you Tommy? I always loved
           you. You and your brother. My two
           boys.
                         
          Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into
          the room. The end of a very long night.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT
                         
          A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before
          explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on
          the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the
          entire east coast has descended on AC.
                         
          Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a
          new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a
          ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero
          outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him

          The crowd at a fever pitch. Two sections full of MARINES in
          dress uniforms cheer insanely. So does an entire section of
          GIRLS wearing camouflage tank tops and holding up signs
          reading "TOMMY GIRLS." Everyone in the arena chants "Tommy!
          Tommy! Tommy!" A cult hero has been born.

          The Marines are on their feet, singing "HALLS OF MONTEZUMA"
          at the top of their lungs.

          At cageside, Sheridan leans over to Callen, raising his voice
          to be heard above the Marines.
                         
                          SHERIDAN
           It sounds like VJ Day in Times
           Square, Bryan. I've never seen
           anything like it!
                         
          Tommy climbs up the stairs and into the cage. He turns and
          nods at the Marines.

           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog Grimes has been looking for
           revenge ever since the day Tommy
           Riordan walked into his gym in
           Pittsburgh and turned his life
           upside down.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           It's been a very long, very
           miserable few months for Mad Dog to
           say the least.

          Mad Dog and Tommy in a STARE DOWN as Josh Rosenthal attempts
          to give them instructions. Unless Mad Dog's mother is in the
          building, every single person in the Boardwalk Hall is
          rooting for Tommy.

           Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a
           camouflage motif for his mohawk
           tonight and the Marines are really
           letting Mad Dog have it.
                         
          The Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes
          over his instructions with the two fighters.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright gentlemen, you've been
           given your instructions. I expect a
           clean fight. Obey my commands at
           all times. Defend yourselves at all
           times. Touch gloves, go back, let's
           do this.
                         
          In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in
          Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less
          intimidated.
           84.
                         
                         
                          MAD DOG
           It's not gonna happen again.
                         
          Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to
          their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog predicted an early
           knockout. Said he was gonna knock
           Tommy out with one punch.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Let's see what Tommy has to say
           about that.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And they are off!
                         
          Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth.
          What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in
          restraint compared to what's happening in that cage.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Tommy tackles him and he's on top!
           He's raining blows!
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Someone has to stop this.
                         
          Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is
          shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside,
          Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Stop it! Stop the fight!
                         
          It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has
          to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his
          mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him
          now. Beaten to an absolute pulp.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           That's the fastest knockout I think
           I've ever seen.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
           He is not moving.
           85.
                         
                         
          Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass,
          and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed.
          Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a
          MEDIC tends to Mad Dog.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           I'll tell you what: you do that to
           someone on the street and they'd
           lock you up and throw away the key!
           Break out the yellow tape, Sam.
           Tommy's walking away from the cage
           like he's leaving a crime scene.

          "ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF
          CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot.
                         
          Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater
          packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN,
          Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As
          he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC,
          Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class
          root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B.
                         
          As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a
          familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito
          shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here.

          Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the
          crowd. They're completely on his side now.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan Conlon came into this
           tournament as a 1000 to 1 underdog,
           and now here he is in the final
           four. The crowd's showing their
           appreciation. They're giving him
           quite the reception.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He's getting a huge reception. I
           mean, this guy shocked everybody
           last night.
                         
          Brendan stands in the corner. Frank leans over the railing of
          the cage and smiles at him.
           86.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           You've got a visitor. Second row,
           10 o'clock.
                         
          Buzzing in the arena. The lights about to go down for the
          entrance of Koba. Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a
          familiar face at cageside. Tess. He can't believe his eyes.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           You alright with that?
                         
          Brendan looks at his wife. She smiles broadly. Mouths the
          words "I love you." Brendan grins. Kisses his glove and
          presses it against the cage. As he does, the lights go out
          inside the arena and ominous RUSSIAN MUSIC BLARES.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           And here comes the great Russian
           Koba.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Koba is so intimidating. His
           reputation is larger than life.
                         
          The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his
          way toward the cage. Brendan watches. So does Frank. Tess
          takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away. She can't bear
          it.
                         
                          FRANK
           I want you to look right at him
           when he comes in here. Don't take
           your eyes off him.
                         
          Brendan nods, then looks at Tess. Drawing strength. Frank
          leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)
           I'm proud of you brother. This is
           your cage.
                         
          Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian
          climbs into the cage. He's massive, and the crowd stares at
          him like an exotic animal.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the
          cage. The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold,
          dispassionate eyes of a killer. Brendan does his best to hold
          his gaze.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Alright, gentlemen, you've been

           Obey my commands at all times.
           Defend yourselves at all times.

           this.
                         
          Brendan retreats to his corner. Takes a deep breath.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Should I be nervous for Brendan?
           `Cause I am. I want to stop the
           fight before it even begins.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, you ready? You ready?
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Koba comes straight at Brendan. His speed and strength are
          astonishing.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Now the question is, how long can
           Brendan Conlon stay alive?
                         
          Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches
          through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping
          Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an
          uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants
          to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs
          with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba just pounding on Brendan
           Conlon! He's pounding on him like a
           side of beef!

          Thousands of people staring at the drive-in screen and you
          can hear a pin drop. They're aghast. Zito can hardly look. KC
          buries her head in Nash's chest.
                         
          ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES. HOW BRENDAN IS

          INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME
                         
          Koba gets Brendan in a BEAR HUG, lifts him off the ground,
          carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of
          laundry, and body SLAMS him on his back.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba's got him in the air. Oh no!

          As Frank screams for Brendan to remain calm, a mortified Tess
          watches. Mercifully, the HORN sounds, and Brendan survives
          the round. He barely makes it back to his corner.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Frank Campana has to think

           Seriously, Sam. How much abuse can

          Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the
          same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved
          up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba
          snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries
          him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he
          can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           That one shook the entire building!
                         
          As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings
          him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies
          through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba
          climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even
          watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the
          fight, the HORN sounds.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Everyone has gotta be concerned
           about Brendan Conlon's bravery
           getting him into trouble here.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           His bravery can get him killed,
           Sam. He's got nothing more to
           prove. He's already lasted two
           rounds against Koba, which is more
           than anyone else can say. You
           wonder what's keeping this guy up.
                         
          Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool.
          Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone.
          He comes at Brendan with aggression instead.
           89.
                         
                         
                          FRANK
           Sit down. Breathe.
           (grabbing Brendan's face)
           Look at me! Look at me! Why are we
           here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are
           we here to win this fight? You tell
           me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw
           in the towel right now. We'll get
           Tess and we will go home. You don't
           knock him out, you lose the fight.
           Understand me? You don't knock him
           out, you don't have a home.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave,
          but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or
          never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Let's go to war!
                         
          Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage,
          but the Russian resumes his supremacy.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon somehow answering the bell
           for round three, but Koba's all
           over him again.
                         
          Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then
          Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg
          kicks. A decent punch or two.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There
           are signs of life in Brendan
           Conlon. He's starting to mix it up!

           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Koba's got him caught in an iron
           vice, squeezing for all it's worth
           and trying to choke the teacher
           out.
                         
          Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his
          moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more
          and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all
          the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back,
          freeing himself from the choke in the process.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He just launched Koba! Can you
           believe this? Conlon just shook off
           a guillotine!
                         
          Brendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon's staying after him! He's
           squeezing him! The tables have
           turned, and the boy scout is
           squeezing the bear!
                         
          Koba shakes off Brendan's submission attempt and stands.
          Brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of
          blows. Brendan's giving as good as he's getting.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Conlon standing and trading with

           CALLEN (V.O.)
           This is a fight! We've got
           ourselves a fight!
                         
          Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian
          responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and
          Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a
          left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is
          momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to
          the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           Conlon going for a knee bar! He's

           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           He's deep on that knee bar!
                         
          Brendan wrenches his body for all it's worth. Frank pounds on
          the apron of the cage.

          The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is
          contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's
          only 10 seconds left in the fight.
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)

           is screaming in pain!
                         
          Four. Three. Koba struggles. Grimaces in agony. Brendan keeps
          wrenching his knee. Two. He can't take it. One. He TAPS!

           A surprising turn in the story of
           Iraq War hero Tommy Riordan. CNN
           has learned that Riordan's true
           identity is that of Marine Staff
           Sergeant Thomas Conlon, who went
           AWOL from his unit earlier this
           year following the friendly fire
           death of his brother-in-arms,
           Sergeant Manny Fernandez.
           Fernandez' wife, Pilar Fernandez,

          He marches out the door and into the bowels of the arena,
          moving past MPS as he goes. His march is as grim as
          Brendan's.

           One more time.
                         
          Brendan climbs into the cage as the house LIGHTS DIM. The
          crowd is going bonkers. And they EXPLODE when Tommy appears
          at the end of the tunnel with his hoodie up and begins his
          march toward the cage.
                         
          The Marines shower him with cheers and "Hoo-ahs." The girls
          scream. The rest of the audience stamps their feet and chants
          his name. But he acknowledges no one, and the hard look on
          his face never wavers.

          And here it is. The two brothers face to face in the middle
          of the ring, staring each other down. Tommy with his usual
          controlled fire, Brendan intense, searching his brother's
          eyes for some flicker of recognition.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Gentlemen, this is the final. Five
           rounds. I expect a clean fight.
           Obey my commands at all times.
           Defend yourselves at all times.
           Touch gloves, go back, let's do
           this.
                         
          As Rosenthal finishes his instructions, Brendan peers into
          Tommy's empty corner.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Where's Pop?
                         
          Tommy turns without answering. All business. Brendan returns
          to his corner. Looks at Tess. So much emotion on her face.

           ready? Let's go to war!
                         
          Tommy comes right after his brother. Just like with his
          previous three opponents. A natural wrecking machine. Frank
          screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him,
          POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other
          fights were for Brendan, this one is worse.

          Tommy continues to batter Brendan, then he swoops in, picks
          him up, and SLAMS his big brother into the ground. Then he
          does it again. And again. And again.
                         
          Brendan, the wind knocked out of him, is on his back, trying
          to protect himself from Tommy, who mounts him and starts
          blasting away with a BLUR of lefts and rights. The only thing
          that saves Brendan is the HORN. Which Tommy ignores, blasting
          his brother with a brutal CHEAP SHOT to the jaw well after
          the round had ended.

           C'mon, Josh!
                         
          Brendan lays on the ground as Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off
          him and admonishes him for the cheap shot. Tommy stares at
          Brendan. You want more?
                         
          Frank runs into the cage with the stool and Brendan limps
          over to him and sits down. Brendan stares at Tommy, who paces
          in his corner like a caged animal.
                         
                          FRANK (CONT'D)

           Beethoven. He's coming hard, just
           like we planned. I want you to
           angle out, hit, and move.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Angle out, hit, and move.
                         
                          FRANK
           Good. Breathe. Relax. He's not your
           brother, right? He's just a guy
           who's in the way.
                         
          Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. It's time. Frank glares at
          him as he picks up the stool.

          Tess sits uncomfortably in her chair. Her husband's face is a

          the TapouT crew, and Colt Boyd look on. The electricity in
          the crowd is greater than ever. They want a champion.

          The Marines in the crowd are all on their feet, screaming for
          Tommy to end it. The chant starts up again. 15,000 strong.
          "Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!" Frank tries to instruct Brendan, but
          he can't hear him, and he's too overwhelmed.
                         
          Tommy presses Brendan against the cage and does the same
          thing Koba did. He lifts him off the ground, carries him on a
          dead run, and body SLAMS him so hard the cage shakes. Then
          Tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again.
                         
          The HORN sounds ending the round, but this time it's Brendan
          who pops up and pushes Tommy. Tommy shoves him back.
          Rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its
          approval.

          Again, Tommy is on top of Brendan, trying to ground and pound
          him into submission. Frank, leaning on the apron nearby,
          screams at Brendan.
                         
                          FRANK
           Switch! Switch!
                         
          Tommy tries to pound Brendan out, but Brendan latches on to
          Tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and REVERSES
          position, just as he did with Midnight, the Dane, and Koba.
          Tommy is in deep trouble. Brendan pushes him face down on the
          canvas and cranks his shoulder. There's no escape.
                         
           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
           Oh my God, that's a deep omoplata!
                         
           CALLEN (V.O.)
           He's doing it again! Conlon's doing
           it again! This is going to be over!
                         
          Brendan applies intense pressure. Tommy's shoulder is
          contorted, WRENCHED backwards, and his face is a mask of
          pain. Tommy's in agony, but he won't give in.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           Tap, Tommy!
                         
          Tommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact,
          he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn
          cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tap!
                         
          The shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy
          and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the
          round.
           99.
                         
                         
          Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if
          Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up
          and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He
          shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence,
          and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them.

          Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands
          defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends
          Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't
          believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him.
                         
          Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water.
          Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his
          brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I popped his shoulder.

           You popped his shoulder? Good. I
           want you to pop his other shoulder.
                         
          This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh
          Rosenthal.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.
                         
                          FRANK
           Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You
           got two rounds left! You need both
           rounds! Go in there, kick him in
           the head, take him down, and finish
           him!
                         
          Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded
          Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low.
          Brendan makes eye contact with him.

          The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless
          right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays
          away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.
                         
                          BRENDAN

          Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded
          Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)

          Tommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights
          and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him.
          Everything about him says "Quit, Tommy." But Tommy won't.

          cage. Quickly figures out what the situation is.
           101.
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME
                         
          Zito and the kids staring at the screen, imploring Brendan to
          take the helpless Tommy out and win the championship.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - SAME
                         
          Brendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid.
          He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he
          doesn't do something.
                         
                          FRANK
           Finish him! You finish him!
                         
          Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally,
          with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the
          defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,
          blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince
          in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.
                         
          Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him
          to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the
          face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes
          pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls
          Brendan away.
                         
                          JOSH ROSENTHAL
           Break! Break!
                         
          Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the
          cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are
          glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet.
                         
          From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye
          contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of
          understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.
                         
                         
          EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME
                         
          The crowd wants a victory. Tito and the boys start the "Mis-
          ter C!" chant again.
                         
          ON MOVIE SCREEN: FRANK ADMONISHES BRENDAN IN HIS CORNER. IT'S
          OBVIOUS WHAT HE'S TELLING HIM, BUT BRENDAN'S EYES ARE FAR
          AWAY. HE'S NOT LISTENING TO A WORD.

          Tommy and Brendan stand for Round Five. Tommy's face is
          battered after Round Four and Brendan's face is ruined.
           102.
                         
                         
          In the crowd, the "Tommy" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact,
          it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and
          carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic
          than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in
          pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down.
                         
                         
          INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          All eyes riveted to the screen, where the brothers circle
          each other as in the fourth round.
                         
          ON SCREEN: MORE PAINFUL STABBING JABS FROM TOMMY. BRENDAN
          GIVES HIM ONE LAST, LONG LOOK, BUT TOMMY RESPONDS BY KICKING
          HIM IN THE LEG. FINALLY, LEFT NO CHOICE, BRENDAN SWOOPS.

          Brendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in
          merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck
          and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and
          there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen.
                         
          As an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan
          CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him.
                         
                          BRENDAN
           I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry!
                         
          Tommy continues to struggle.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           Tap, Tommy! Tap!
                         
          Tears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind
          pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge.
                         
                          BRENDAN (CONT'D)
           I love you, Tommy! I love you!
                         
          Tommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly
          opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder
          on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting.

          leap into each other's arms, Joe Zito stares at the screen.

          Frank makes eye contact with the jubilant Tess. Indicates she
          should meet them in the locker room. Meanwhile, people pour
          into the cage. Frank pushes them aside, keeping them away
          from Brendan and Tommy, who remain on the ground, exhausted.
          Tommy to begins to WEEP.

          Tommy buries his head in Brendan's chest. A torrent of
          sobbing gushes from him, years of pain pouring out in heavy
          bursts. From the crowd, Paddy stares into the cage and
          watches as Brendan comforts his little brother, then helps
          him to his feet.
                         
          Callen, Sheridan, and J.J. Riley make their way inside for
          the post-fight interview, cameras trailing behind them. With
          Frank continuing to run interference, Brendan pushes through
          the crush of people, arm around Tommy, and exits the cage.
                         
          The crowd parts for Tommy and Brendan. Paddy watches them, a
          tear in his eye. He's overwhelmed by the sight of his two
          boys together again.
                         
          As the noise from the arena fades, the brothers walk through
          the wild crowd and continue on through the tunnel, arm in
          arm...

          EXT. MODERN CIRCUS GROUNDS - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

          An upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The
          Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen...Trucks are
          being loaded with animals.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          AN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands
          alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot.
          His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort
          for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear,
          Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile.
          CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with
          rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair.

                         CHARLIE
          Excuse me sir, can we help you?
          (No reply from Jacob)
          Did you miss your ride?

                         JACOB
          I missed the Spec.

                         RUSS
          The what?

                         CHARLIE
          Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we
          call someone for you?

                         JACOB

                         (SAD)
          Where'd it all go?

                         RUSS
          He's seriously old.

                         CHARLIE
          Did you come with the folks from
          the retirement home?

                         JACOB
          No, I came on my own.

                         CHARLIE

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          Let's go inside and we can call
          them to pick you up.
          Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair.
          Jacob resists.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         JACOB
          No, I told ya, I came on my own and
          I'm not going back. Get your hands
          off me.

                         RUSS
          (as if talking to a child)
          It's OK. We're gonna call the home
          so they can come pick you up.

                         JACOB

                         (SUDDENLY LUCID)
          Why don't you pick some of those
          rings out ya head maybe you won't
          be so stupid, ya dumb little shit.

                         RUSS
          Woah! The language. Uncalled for.

                         CHARLIE
          Sir, we need to get you out of this
          parking lot. My trucks have to come
          through here. Please...
          He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I got it Russ. Take the walker.
          Finish closing up the ticket booth.
          Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob.

                         JACOB
          In my day, they had old timers in
          the ticket wicket and freaks like
          him in the sideshow. Damn kid
          didn't even know what the Spec was.

                         CHARLIE
          You sound like you know circuses.
          Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home.

                         JACOB
          I should. I was on two.

                         CHARLIE
          (Calling OS to Trucks)
          Malcolm, tell them to come through!
          (Patronizing, to Jacob)
          Two circuses. Wow, that's
          something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         JACOB
          Ringling, of course, but that was
          later...

                         CHARLIE
          I'll need your name when I call the
          home.

                         JACOB
          ...First one was called Benzini
          Brothers Most Spectacular Show ...
          Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name.

                         CHARLIE
          What?...Wait a minute! Did you say
          you were with the Benzini Brothers?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          What years?

                         JACOB

          1931.

                         CHARLIE
          "31?...You're saying you were there
          for the---?

                         JACOB
          I was in the middle of it.

                         CHARLIE

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          I don't believe this. After the
          Hartford Fire and the Hagenback-
          Wallace Wreck, that's the most
          famous circus disaster of all time.

                         JACOB
          I remember it like yesterday...
          Better - cause I don't remember
          yesterday.

                         CHARLIE

                         (EXTENDS HAND)
          Charlie O'Brien the third.

                         JACOB
          Jacob Jankowski the only.

                         CHARLIE
          Mr. Jankowski, I would be honored
          if you would have a drink with me
          in my trailer.

          A bottle of expensive, Laphroaig scotch sits on the table.
          Charlie pours them each a shot. Jacobs drinks. It feels good.

                         JACOB
          (to the Scotch)
          Ah, I remember you...Camel would've
          loved this stuff.

                         CHARLIE
          Camels drink scotch?
          Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another;

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          You really got here on you're own?

                         JACOB
          The Great Escape! But I got lost.

                         CHARLIE
          I should call the home, let them
          know where you are.

                         JACOB
          I don't know why they call it a
          "home". You don't know anybody
          there. They fill you so full of
          drugs, you don't care...Five kids
          and not one has a place for me
          since their mother died. They take
          turns visiting me on weekends. They
          forgot whose turn it was today so
          nobody showed up..

                         (BEAT)
          I had a life, ya know. A big
          life...It isn't right.
          Charlie empathizes. Pours another. Changes the subject.

                         CHARLIE
          So, how did the Benzini Brothers
          stampede start? The story is two
          guys got thrown off the train and--

                         JACOB
          No point in telling a story if all
          you want to know is the end.

                         CHARLIE
          Sorry. From the beginning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         JACOB
          Now, let's see...the beginning...
          Well, everything began the same day
          everything ended...Ha, isn't that
          how it always works?...

          of JACOB JANKOWSKI - 23 years old, handsome, full of energy.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          It was a big day. My final exams.

          INT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen.
          JACOB'S MOTHER AND FATHER are finishing up breakfast. The
          Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe...The Mother
          pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls.
          Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and
          downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH...
          His father says something supportive in POLISH as well. Jacob
          thanks him in POLISH. He kisses his mother and exits.

          EXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - ITHACA NY - 1931 - MORNING

          A simple, clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood.
          Jacob runs out, passing his father's sign on the front lawn:

          E. JANKOWSKI
          Doctor of Veterinary Medicine

          EXT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY.

          The beautiful campus of Cornell University. Jacob runs.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          After six years of dissections,
          castrations, foalings and shoving
          my arm up a cow's ass more times
          than I cared to remember, I was
          finally going to graduate Cornell
          in Veterinary Science. I was summa
          cum laude...ha,ha and the oldest
          male virgin on campus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          INT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL, 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY

          Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with
          her legs. She notices him staring, crosses her legs and
          smooths her skirt.
          VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
          Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk.

                         THE PROCTOR
          You may begin.
          Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam
          booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I had my whole life planned. I knew
          exactly where it was taking me...
          And then, with the opening of a
          door, it all vanished.
          The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
          walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then:

                         THE PROCTOR
          Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word?
          Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up.

          EXT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Jacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins.

                         DEAN WILKINS
          Jacob, it's your parents. I'm
          afraid there's been a car accident.

          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - ITHACA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Jacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a Police Chief and a
          Chaplain to the Morgue led by a Nurse. We follow them inside.

          INT. CORONER'S MORGUE - ITHACA HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          The room is windowless and bare except for TWO GURNEYS, each
          with a sheet-covered body. A CORONER stands between them.
          Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents
          belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CORONER
          Are you ready?
          The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder.
          Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then
          Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression:

                         CHAPLAIN
          Is there any other family to call?

                         JACOB
          No. Just me.

          INT. EDMUND HYDE LAW OFFICES - DAY

          Jacob, in a black suit. Mr. Hyde is seated opposite him.

                         HYDE
          I know this is difficult for you,
          but there's been no mistake. The
          house and all their assets,
          including your father's practise,
          are now property of the bank in
          default of the mortgage.

                         JACOB
          But I'm telling you, my father put
          away every penny he ever earned.
          They owned that house outright. Why
          would he have a mortgage?

                         HYDE
          My guess is because he let people
          pay him in beans & eggs or whatever
          they had, instead of money.

                         JACOB
          And so he's penalized for not
          turning away people who couldn't
          afford his help? He was a doctor.

                         HYDE
          Yes, I know, he was a very good man
          but in banking terms, in the
          reality of what makes this world
          actually function, he was an
          irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but
          you oughta to know the truth. This
          Depression is going to last for a
          long while..

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         HYDE (CONT'D)
          ..And the only ones who will be
          standing at the end of it, are the
          ones who fight to take what they
          need to survive. Everyone else is
          going to disappear. Don't make the
          same mistakes as your father.
          Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father.

          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - OUTSIDE ITHACA, NY - DAY

          Jacob in his black suit walking home..looks up ahead to see:

          EXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          All the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over
          by strangers: father's Philco radio, mother's jewelry...A
          foreclosure sign hangs beside his father's business sign:

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Things happened so fast, my head
          was spinning. And that mortgage...I
          just couldn't figure it out.
          A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb. It is met by A BANK
          REPRESENTATIVE, who receives a package and carries it to
          Jacob, meeting him halfway.

                         BANK REPRESENTATIVE
          This just came for you, Jacob.
          Whatever it is I'm going to have to
          include in the bank's report of
          assets. Sorry. You OK?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          I also have documents to sign..
          The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the
          package,

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I didn't believe the lawyer or the
          bank. My mother worked. They had
          savings. We were never broke. So
          why would they need a mortgage?
          And then it hit me...
          Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading;

          E. JANKOWSKI AND SON

          DOCTORS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          They did it to pay for my Ivy
          League education.
          For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
          his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
          speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer. He
          drops the sign and walks away. The Bank Rep calls after him:

                         BANK REPRESENTATIVE
          Jacob? Jacob they need these signed
          by the end of the business day.
          Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
          tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I walked and I kept on walking...
          It's a strange feeling becoming an
          orphan the same time you're
          becoming a man...To have this
          freedom to be anything you want at
          the same time everything you were
          is taken away. So I just walked
          ...Then all of a sudden, I stopped.

          EXT. A CLEARING NEAR A STREAM - OUTSKIRTS OF ITHACA - NIGHT

          Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream. He is no longer
          crying. There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Like I'd been sleepwalking and I
          woke up. I had no idea where I was.
          Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and
          the cries of distant animals in the woods. It unnerves him.
          Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING FLICKERING
          LIGHT - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees.
          The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
          Jacob's direction. He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK...
          Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
          path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as:

          THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM.
          Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
          knocks him down. It is dark and the train is moving fast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          What is it inside of us makes us
          decide to grab onto life again and
          again, no matter how many times it
          abandons us without a second
          thought?...What is it makes us
          hungry for more of the same?
          Somebody smart should figure that
          one out.
          Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
          train...stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing
          his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for
          something to grab hold of to hoist himself up. He sees:
          AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIM...As it catches up
          to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold
          and flings himself upward. He clings on with his left leg,
          elbow and chin. His right hand clings to the grab hold. With
          his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but
          the aged wood scraps off under his fingers. His right leg is
          dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the
          tracks. Jacob is slipping...slipping...
          With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final "life or
          death" effort, managing to get his left knee up over the
          edge. Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he
          scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting...

          INT. STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          A dim light barely illuminates the interior. Jacob breaths a
          brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE

          HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE

          DARKNESS, GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR, HOISTING HIM UP.
          Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked
          easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.

          OLD TIMER (O.S.)
          Oh, don't go messin with Blackie.
          Throwing people off of trains is
          one of the perks of his job.
          Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
          ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE, aimed at Jacob. Another, A SHRUNKEN,
          STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER, drinks out of a jug...
          Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as
          trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         BLACKIE
          We don't need no bums on this train
          brother. You can get off right now
          and keep running.
          Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg,
          inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern...

                         OLD TIMER
          Now everybody calm down here. Grady
          put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE
          LET'IM GO...And I mean on the
          inside of the train!
          Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.

          OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
          I'm tellin ya, ya can't red light
          him, we don't need that trouble.
          Look at them clothes - he's no bum.
          Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the
          train and returns to the card game. Jacob pants, relieved.

          OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
          Don't be sore kid. It's more like a
          reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel..And
          that there's Grady. And Bill.

                         JACOB
          Jacob. Jankowski. Nice to meet you.

                         CAMEL
          You're pretty young for the rails.
          You running from something boy? You
          on the lam?

                         JACOB
          No. Nothing like that.

                         CAMEL
          Where you headed?

                         JACOB
          I don't know.

                         CAMEL
          Hungry? Outta work?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          No shame in it. What can you do?

                         JACOB
          About anything I guess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Camel gives him the once-over look then offers the jug.

                         CAMEL
          We land in Deposit in the morning.
          We'll find you some work. And if
          you're still alive by the end of
          it, I'll get you some food and take
          you to Uncle August.
          Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor.

                         JACOB
          Who's that?

                         GRADY
          August Rosenbluth...Lord and Master
          of the Known and Unknown Universes.
          Ringmaster Extraordinaire.
          Jacob looks baffled. Camel laughs as he drinks more;

                         CAMEL
          Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't
          notice?
          Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused.

                         BILL
          Ha, he really don't know.

                         CAMEL
          HA! You didn't just jump a train
          boy. You jumped the Flying Squadron
          of the Benzini Brothers Most
          Spectacular Show on Earth...
          You done landed your ass on a
          circus, kid!
          PRE-LAP: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt!

          INT. STOCK CAR - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN.

          Jacob is rolled awake as the train stops. He is disoriented
          as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock
          car door. Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug.

          EXT. CIRCUS TRAIN/CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN.

          The Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot. Beyond
          it, the scattered buildings of Deposit, NY backlit by dawn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees::
          Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train
          like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted
          scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on
          each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH.
          Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents
          are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men
          standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man
          sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck
          speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their
          combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it!
          Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling
          wagons are charging right for Jacob..
          Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out
          of place...in the way of this finely tuned machine.
          Jacob ducks into a LARGE TENT for safety.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob enters. A stillness takes the place of the chaos
          outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky. It has
          barely been set up - just the tent and:

          THE ANIMALS.
          Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand
          behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their
          heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain-
          link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps
          and an Orangutan.
          The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
          acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile.
          The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for
          something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand.

                         JACOB
          What is it? What do you want?
          The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing.
          Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
          ground in front of the cage. He picks it up.
          Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She
          takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and
          reaches out for Jacob again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to
          trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers.
          The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and
          holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the
          gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          You're welcome, ma'am.
          The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den.

          CAMEL (O.S.)
          What the hell you doing in here?
          Get outta there!! You ain't a
          menagerie man. Only menagerie men
          is allowed in there.
          Jacob runs out to Camel.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Camel escorts Jacob through the grounds to a baggage car.

                         CAMEL
          Gonna try to get you set up with
          Crazy Joe.

                         JACOB
          Do I call him Crazy Joe?

                         CAMEL
          It has been said Crazy Joe went to
          prison for killing a man who spit
          into the wind and hit the back of
          Joe's neck. So no, I would not call
          this man Crazy Joe to his face.
          Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where
          CRAZY JOE stands - a burly man, missing three fingers.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          Hey Joe! I got a First of May here.
          Think you can use him?
          Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco
          juice then disappears back inside. Camel tells Jacob;

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          You're in, kid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          INT/EXT. BAGGAGE STOCK CAR - DEPOSIT, NY - MORNING

          Jacob and another Young Man, WADE, with their shirts off, are
          shovelling tons of horse manure. Jacob is queasy, blinking
          from the stench. The Young Man doesn't seem bothered.

                         JACOB
          I've never seen so much manure!

                         WADE
          Baggage stock horses. They pack'em
          in 27 a car.

                         JACOB
          How do you stand the smell?

                         WADE
          What smell?

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - MORNING

          Jacob and several other Flying Squadron men struggle to pull
          on cables hoisting up the canvases on the Big Top. It takes a
          tremendous effort. Jacob uses every bit of strength.
          When the Big Top is raised, Jacob can't help but be impressed
          with the accomplishment as the local townsfolk (rubes) cheer.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY

          Jacob struggles to shovel LLAMA manure out of the menagerie.
          He checks his hands - they are blistered and bleeding.

          EXT. SIDESHOW TENTS - MIDWAY - DEPOSIT, NY - AFTERNOON

          CECIL, THE BARKER, is "speechifying" from a platform beside
          the sideshow entrance, strutting back and forth, as a crowd
          gathers... Jacob and other working men, including Wade, are
          positioned around the perimeter of the crowd.

                         WADE
          When Cecil gives the signal ya
          gotta push the rubes in towards the
          entrance but without them catching
          on or else they'll be a fight.
          Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant
          around the perimeter of the crowd facing Cecil.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          When Cecil pulls his ear (the Signal)...Jacob and the other
          men move forward, inching the crowd into the sideshow tents.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY

          Jacob shovels YAK manure more easily having taped his
          blistered hands.

          EXT. BARBARA'S SHOW TENT - DEPOSIT, NY - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Grady hands Jacob a long lead pipe.

                         GRADY
          Stand inside the tent and smack the
          sides with this when you see a head
          trying to peek in without paying.
          Jacob follows Grady into the tent...

          INT. BARBARA'S SHOW TENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob enters and is paralyzed by what he sees:
          Camera angles behind BARBARA - a topless woman on stage alone
          in front of rows of ogling men - as she maneuvers her breasts
          in circles flipping the tassels attached to them...The men
          hoot and holler for more as Barbara smiles encouragingly,
          hiding her routine boredom.
          Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman.
          Grady frantically motions for Jacob to snap out of it and use
          the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in...
          Startled out of his enthrallment, Jacob lifts the pipe too
          quickly and hits his own forehead. OW!..then proceeds to do
          his job, banging the heads thru the flaps.

          INT. CIRCUS GROUNDS/MENAGERIE TENT - DEPOSIT, NY - TWILIGHT

          Jacob shovels ZEBRA manure, no longer affected by the scent.
          By this point, the menagerie tent has been fully installed:
          Ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating
          the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tent's center.
          Jacob hears someone entering the menagerie. He turns to see;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob
          catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined
          gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them.
          She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain
          skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle...
          Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses;
          Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with
          her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at
          her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to
          her, rise up on their hind legs...
          She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
          a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step.
          Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the
          foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering
          Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day.

                         JACOB
          Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob.
          Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          May I? He may be foundering.
          Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
          hands up Silver Star's fetlock. To Marlena's surprise, the
          horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof. Jacob examines it.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          He should be all right for tonight.
          But I'd put him on stall rest as
          soon as possible.
          He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks
          both impressed and insulted. Jacob smiles. Marlena does not.
          She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads
          them out of the menagerie....Jacob looks after her adoringly.

                         WE PRE-LAP:

          UNCLE AUGUST (V.O.)

          LAAADIIIEEESS AND GENTLEMENNNNN!

          AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES.

          INT. BIG TOP - DEPOSIT, NY - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          Camera follows Jacob into the Big Top ...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         UNCLE AUGUST

          WELCOME TO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT

          EXTRAVAGANCY THE HUMAN EYE CAN

          BEHOLD...WELCOME THE STARS OF THE

          BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR

          SHOW ON EARTH!!!
          Jacob arrives as we reveal:

          THE EXTRAORDINARY GRANDEUR OF THE SPEC - EVERY ACT, EVERY

          ANIMAL - IN FULL REGALIA, PARADE FOR THE AUDIENCE AS THE BAND

          PLAYS. IN THE CENTER RING IS:
          Jacob can barely contain himself...The Audience - young and
          old - is captivated. Faces of poor Depression era townspeople
          light up with joy and amazement;
          During Jacob's lines we see; Clowns, jugglers, acrobats,
          exotic animals, Marlena with her Horses, high divers on fire
          diving into a tank of water...it is truly spectacular:

          JACOB (V.O.)
          You never saw anything like it. You
          could hardly take it all in without
          fearing you might go blind from the
          shine. From one kind of world too
          hard to bear came some kind a
          heaven no one knew existed.
          End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who
          form a tableau, as a curtain of sparks falls behind them.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          The Big Top drops. Poles topple. Horses, men and equipment
          dismantle the great city of tents.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          And then just as quickly, heaven
          was packed away and gone.

          INT. PERFORMER'S CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

          As the train travels, a worn out Jacob sits cramped under a
          bunk beside A CONTORTIONIST taking up little space. Jacob
          voraciously eats a plate of food Camel snuck in for him.

                         CAMEL
          You like the food? You deserve it.
          You done good, I hear..

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)

                         (JACOB CHOKES)
          ..Woah, you better take a breath
          before it all comes back up on ya.
          Here. Have a hit of Jake.
          He offers Jacob his "Jake". Jacob drinks and chokes.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          It's an acquired taste. Now get
          yourself outta there. I'm gonna
          take you in to see August.
          As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and
          takes up more space.

                         JACOB
          But it's the middle of the night.

                         CAMEL
          Only time circus people live - when
          they don't have to work. Come on...

          INT. SLEEPING CARS/ PLATFORM - TRAIN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

          Camel leads Jacob through various sleeping cars, revealing
          the lowly conditions of life on the road...wooden bunks, no
          private space, one bathroom for a dozen to share.

          THROUGHOUT THIS NARRATION WE JUMP CUT INTO VARIOUS CARS:
          - The Musicians Car: Men smoking, cleaning
          instruments...looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor.
          The Trumpet Player plays TAPS. Jacob doesn't understand why.

                         CAMEL
          I got a son about your age. Lives
          outside of Reading, PA. Haven't
          seen him for years. Fix your shirt
          there.
          Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid.
          - The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing
          cards. They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last
          mile. One Clown waves goodbye.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          Remember, when you meet August let
          him do the talking and don't ever
          mention Ringling. He hates them
          bastards worse than the Depression.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          - Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms
          of undress, negligees, sheer robes. Barbara exits a bathroom
          and bumps into Jacob, who fumbles seeing her half-nude;

                         BARBARA
          How's your pipe, kid?
          Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away.

                         CAMEL
          Night ladies.

          BARBARA AND GIRLS
          Night Camel.

          INT. PERFORMER STATEROOM CARS - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Slightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger
          aisle outside individual doors and windows.

                         JACOB
          Hey Camel - who's that woman who
          works the horses?

                         CAMEL

                         (STOPS)
          Now stop right there. That's
          Marlena. She don't talk to nobody
          and you don't talk to her. And
          don't mention her to August. Ain't
          no right way to talk about
          somebody's wife and make it sound
          like a compliment.

                         JACOB
          Wife?
          Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask:

                         CAMEL
          Look, kid, before we do this, I
          gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to
          know your business but I do know
          you ain't been on the road too
          long. You're too clean, your
          clothes too nice and you don't got
          a possession on you. See, a man on
          the road collects little things.
          It's not a big life I can tell ya.
          So before you start, I ask: if you
          got any kind of life to go back to,
          that's what you should do.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Jacob stops. He tries to not sound emotional when he says:

                         JACOB
          I don't.
          Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said.

                         CAMEL
          I am sorry to hear that.
          They move on.

          EXT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          They reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet. Standing
          upon it is an enormous, muscular BALD MAN, EARL...

                         CAMEL
          This here's Earl. He's gonna take
          you in. Earl, this here's Jacob.

                         JACOB
          (shakes hands w/Camel)
          I don't know how to thank you.

                         CAMEL
          HA! You may not want to after you
          been on a show long as I have. Good
          luck to ya, kid.
          Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks:

                         JACOB
          Do I look OK?

                         EARL
          Very nice.
          Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the
          other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him
          head first into the car.

          INT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob falls into Uncle August's opulent private car, with
          wood panelling, cushioned furniture and chandeliers.
          Sitting at a table playing cards are CECIL the Barker,
          DIAMOND JOE (menagerie and ring stock), MR. ERWIN (talent
          booker), CRAZY JOE (baggage stock) and, with his back to us
          in a high wing back chair, (UNCLE) AUGUST ROSENBLUTH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          Earl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor.
          As August speaks to Jacob, all we see is the back of his head
          and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout...

                         AUGUST
          What's this?

                         EARL
          That stowaway the old drunk took
          under his wing. College boy.
          Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall.

                         AUGUST
          (to the game)
          I'll see your three and raise you
          five...

                         (TO JACOB)
          I don't believe I've had the
          pleasure.

                         JACOB
          Jacob Jankowski, sir.

                         AUGUST
          And what is a "Jacob Jankowski" and
          why he is on my train?

                         JACOB
          Just looking for work, sir.

          MR. ERWIN
          Can you fly? Set yourself on fire?

                         JACOB
          No sir.

                         AUGUST
          Ever worked a show, son?

                         JACOB
          No sir.

                         AUGUST
          Ever been to a show?

                         JACOB
          Yes sir...
          Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Ringling Brothers.
          August stops playing cards. The others react with sudden
          apprehension. Earl casually shakes his head to warn Jacob.
          August finally rises and turns to Camera: handsome,
          charismatic, fiercely intelligent...matinee idol looks that
          mask a darker nature.

                         AUGUST
          Ringling, you say?

                         JACOB
          Yes. But it was terrible.

                         AUGUST
          Really? Have you seen our show?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          What was your favorite act?
          Jacob sees a CIRCUS POSTER with Marlena and her Horses.

                         JACOB
          The uh...the one with the black and
          white horses. And the girl in pink.

                         AUGUST
          Ah, our Star Attraction. Well, I
          believe we're looking for a boy to
          carry water for the elephants,
          aren't we Diamond Joe?

                         DIAMOND JOE
          We don't have an eleph-

                         AUGUST
          Shut-up.

                         JACOB
          I would do that, sir. I'd like to
          work with the animals.
          August and the others chuckle. Jacob doesn't understand why.
          August crosses to Jacob, as he ridicules:

                         AUGUST
          And you'd carry water for
          elephants? Ha, ha...you have any
          idea how much water an elephant
          drinks, kid? College! Pfft! Never
          met a college man yet who knew his
          own ass from shinola.

          24.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

                         (MORE SINISTER)
          You eat my food and you ride my
          train like you're entitled to
          survive. But you see, nothing
          survives here without my
          permission...Maybe if you tell me
          you're nothing, I'll let you stay,
          although my bet is you won't last.
          Jacob refuses to let August demean him. He stays silent.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          You smell like every kind of shit.
          Why would a college boy want that?

                         JACOB
          Times are hard for everybody...And
          I guess because ... out of all the
          dirt and sweat and shit and working
          with fellas you don't want to be
          caught dead meeting in the
          daylight, comes...so much beauty.
          We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words.

                         AUGUST
          That's beautifully put.

                         (THEN:)
          Toss him off, Earl. And make sure
          you see the red light before you
          red light him.
          As Earl drags Jacob in tow, August derides him to the others;

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Another sonny boy mad at mommy and
          daddy for paying the bills. Sounds
          like he studied poetry.

                         CRAZY JOE
          I got no use for people who rhyme.

                         JACOB
          (shouts as he is dragged)
          It was veterinary science! And I
          can tell you one thing - that Star
          Attraction horse of yours won't be
          walking in a few days let alone
          performing center ring!!
          August stops and turns.

                         AUGUST
          Earl wait!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Earl stops with Jacob. Now all the men are intrigued...

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Veterinary science?
          (Earl stops with Jacob)
          May I ask what school?

                         JACOB
          Cornell.

                         AUGUST

                         (IMPRESSED)
          You're a Cornell graduate?
          Jacob lies and nods...August wonders whether to trust Jacob.

                         DIAMOND JOE
          Marlena did want a vet to take a
          look at Silver Star. They cost.

                         CECIL
          He worked the rubes for me this
          afternoon. Pretty good.

                         CRAZY JOE
          He shovelled horse shit. Don't make
          him a horse doctor.
          August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it:

                         JACOB
          I hear Ringling has its own vet.
          The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it
          amuses August, who faces him and smiles;

                         AUGUST
          All right, Cornell. Come with me.
          August leads Jacob out.

          EXT. PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          August and Jacob exit onto the platform.

                         AUGUST
          Are you sure-footed, Jacob
          Jankowski?

                         JACOB
          I believe so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         AUGUST
          Good.
          Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of
          something around the side of the car and disappears.

                         JACOB

          JESUS CHRIST!
          The train jerks a curve. Jacob almost falls.

          AUGUST (O.S.)

          COME ON THEN!
          Jacob looks up to see:
          August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his
          hair blowing wildly in the wind...He points downward.
          Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform
          as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing;
          He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder. He wipes his hands
          on his thighs. Focuses. Then leaps...
          Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly
          until it ensnares the other side. His feet jam into the
          rungs. Jacob climbs to the roof.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          August gives Jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged.

          POV; THE LENGTH OF THE TRAIN AHEAD OF THEM STRETCHES LIKE A

          GIANT SNAKE MOVING IN THE NIGHT, BENDING ROUND A CURVE.

                         AUGUST
          It's a breath taking sight, isn't
          it? Always gets me.

                         (THEN:)
          I can't get a new Liberty Horse mid-
          season. So you make sure this horse
          performs and the job's yours. Nine
          bucks a week. If you cross me, I'll
          feed you to my meat eaters and
          there won't be a trace left of
          you...
          Jacob hangs on every word. August smiles;

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          You do right by me, Jacob
          Jankowski...I'll show you what it's
          like to travel every inch of this
          country, every inch of this world,
          and be welcomed home in every
          street, be loved in every
          town...I'll give you a life most
          suckers can't dream of.
          Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap dances
          across the roofs. Jacob has no choice but to follow...
          The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car
          across the moving train...Jacob grows increasingly confident
          and euphoric following August's exultant lead.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          August drops into the Ring Stock Car followed by Jacob. On
          one side is a line of Marlena's Black and White Show Horses.
          The other side, there is a makeshift door.
          August kicks through the door, revealing a small room;

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          This makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next
          to a cot, propped up by a wall of trunks.
          A DWARF "KINKO" (WALTER) is reading on his cot. He has red
          hair. He and August greet each other with polite disgust...

                         AUGUST
          Kinko.

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          August.

                         AUGUST
          This is Jacob. He's going to bunk
          with you a while.

                         JACOB
          How do you do?

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          What is he?

                         AUGUST
          I said his name is Jacob.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          I asked what, not who.

                         AUGUST
          He's going to help out in the
          menagerie.

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          A menagerie man? Performers don't
          bunk with working men.
          There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier, QUEENIE.

                         AUGUST
          Well there are performers..
          (his hand indicates high

                         STANDARD)
          And then there are performers..
          (his hand indicates lower
          "Kinko" standard)
          Considering we used to keep the
          goats in here, I'm sure Marlena's
          horses out there object to now
          sharing their quarters with you. Of
          course I can always change that and
          send you back to a bottom bunk with
          the other kinkers who sorely miss
          your sunny personality and
          affectionate camaraderie.
          (Kinko knows this threat)
          This gentleman is the show's new
          veterinarian - Ivy League no less -
          which puts him a good deal higher
          than you in my estimation. Perhaps
          you'd like to offer him your cot.
          As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko
          knows he has no choice. August smiles and turns to leave.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          I'll find you in the morning. Sleep
          well, Cornell.
          August exits....Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and
          Queenie, who snarls at him. Jacob tries to be friendly:

                         JACOB
          A Jack Russell. They're very smart.

                         KINKO (WALTER)

                         (CALMLY)
          Queenie attack.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Queenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed. Jacob is
          pressed against the wall. Kinko returns to his book.

          KINKO (WALTER) (CONT'D)
          You're not getting the cot.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - LIBERTY, NY - DAWN.

          Jacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket
          beside Camel. Camel starts hitting his leg. He laughs:

                         CAMEL
          Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling
          asleep on me. Pretty soon the only
          place for me is going to be selling
          tickets but I'm too ugly for that.

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          Jacob!
          Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his
          guard. He turns his back to continue washing.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          We can do better than this for our
          new vet. I'll arrange for you to
          start getting your own water bucket
          like the performers and bosses. Two
          buckets per person. Come...
          August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow...

                         JACOB
          See ya Camel.

                         CAMEL
          (sips his Jake)
          Yeah, take care kid.

          INT PERFORMER'S TENT - LIBERTY, NY - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
          August and Jacob enter a more upscale tent where male
          performers are washing from personal buckets of water.

                         AUGUST
          You'll need new clothes too. I'll
          set you up with the Monday Man.

                         JACOB
          Monday Man?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         AUGUST
          What day of the week did your
          mother hang out the wash to dry?

                         JACOB

                         (REALIZING)
          He takes other people's clothes?

                         AUGUST
          It's the Depression, Cornell. Where
          have you been? Oh right - Cornell.
          Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches
          one of them away.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Here, use Kinko's second bucket for
          now.

                         (TO KINKO)
          You barely use up one.
          Kinko fumes. Jacob tries to placate.

                         JACOB
          August, it's all right, I'll--

                         AUGUST

                         (IGNORES HIM)
          If you need a razor, there are some
          back there with my name on them.
          August walks away. Jacob follows August away from Kinko.

                         JACOB
          August..
          When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard...

                         AUGUST

                         (SINCERE)
          It's good to have an educated man
          like you around. I need one other
          sane individual in this operation.

                         JACOB

                         (COMPLIMENTED)
          Thank you for everything, August.
          August pats his back and exits. Jacob heads for the bucket.

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          Ah...Jacob?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         JACOB

                         (STOPS)
          Yes, August?

                         AUGUST
          The horse.
          August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought
          he was going to bathe.

                         JACOB
          Oh! Yes...The horse.
          Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING

          Diamond Joe and GREG, a ring stock man in overalls, are
          leading the Marlena's horses out of the ring stock car...

                         AUGUST
          I'm sure it's nothing serious.
          Don't tell my wife I said this but
          she coddles them too much. She has
          a particularly strong affection for
          Silver Star. I don't encourage it.
          It's unhealthy to love an animal
          that much...Here she is.
          Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski,
          Benzini Brothers own veterinarian.

                         JACOB
          It's a pleasure to meet you.
          Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous
          meeting a secret (for which Jacob is grateful). August puts
          his arm around her and they kiss.

                         AUGUST
          Last stall. Lead the way, doc.
          They enter the ring stock car...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING

          Jacob, Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver
          Star is laying down. He is breathing heavily, his rib cage
          rising and falling. Jacob immediately senses the worst.

                         AUGUST
          Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad
          in the show.
          Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain.
          Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head,
          and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby.
          Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star
          to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to
          examine him as Marlena watches protectively.
          Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He
          lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger
          on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof,
          which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge.
          Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Is that the problem?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          Do you need any hoof testers?
          Diamond Joe has them...

                         JACOB
          Not yet.

                         AUGUST
          Well, how are you going to fix it?
          Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob
          doesn't want to tell her the truth.
          Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the
          horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper.

                         JACOB
          I didn't want to say anything in
          front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's
          already foundering.

                         AUGUST
          English.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         JACOB
          This horse isn't getting back on
          his feet, August. If there was
          anything I could do, I would but
          we're going to have to put him
          down...I'm real sorry.
          Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through
          him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too
          long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone:

                         AUGUST
          I know you are. Come with me.
          August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.

          EXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT

          TWO BUCKETS FILLED WITH PUTRID MEAT. Flies buzzing on top.
          Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one.

                         AUGUST
          Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm
          afraid. Jacob here says there's no
          hope. We're going to have to put
          him down...
          Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...So I need you to round up Pete
          and Greg, get a wagon and a harness
          stretcher. He has to be hauled.

                         DIAMOND JOE
          A harness what?

                         AUGUST
          Jacob and I'll take care of the
          cats. We'll meet you back at the
          stall.

                         (TO JACOB)
          Grab the other bucket, will you?
          Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and
          Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat.

                         JACOB
          August, this stuff has gone off. Do
          the cats really eat this?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         AUGUST
          No, they really love goats.
          (Jacob looks to him)
          We're all out of goats.

          EXT. CAT CAR - MOMENTS LATER - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT

          Jacob waits with the buckets outside the car. August is
          inside unlocking the padlocks, then reappears and jumps out.

                         AUGUST
          Go ahead. They get a bucket each.
          Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets.

          INT. CAT CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          The cat dens have two compartments: to the left is a pair of
          lions. To the right, a tiger and a panther. All are massive.
          As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously.
          August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on
          the cage bars. The animals can smell the buckets now. They
          growl. Jacob is a bit unhinged:

                         JACOB
          What do I do, just open the door
          and toss it in?

                         AUGUST
          Unless you think a formal sit-down
          is appropriate.
          Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat
          rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and
          rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Why don't you start with Rex...
          that's him on the left.
          August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane
          and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit
          more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly shouts,
          unnerving Jacob even more:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          WAIT!

                         (JACOB JUMPS)
          Not that one, that one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          He points to a difference bucket. Jacob can see no difference
          between them, but no matter. He lifts the bucket and
          approaches the lion's cage. Rex, the lion, lunges at the den
          door. Jacob freezes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          What's the matter? Didn't they
          cover this in school?
          August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing
          his mangy coat against the cage bars.
          Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his
          feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away from
          the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can spill
          out the contents of the bucket:
          Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB
          SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which
          cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food.
          Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm.
          He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd
          dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken.
          August is hysterically laughing. Furious, Jacob storms off;

                         JACOB
          What the hell is wrong with you?
          You think that's funny?

                         AUGUST

                         (LAUGHING)
          Yes I do! Aw Jacob wait! Don't be
          sore! I was having a little fun!

                         JACOB
          FUN! I could have lost my arm!

                         AUGUST

                         (LAUGHS)
          Rex hasn't got any teeth...
          Jacob feels more foolish and walks away, when, just as
          quickly, August's tone of voice turns darker:

          AUGUST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Jacob..
          Jacob stops and turns. August isn't laughing any more. He has
          that sniper's stare of August's darker side...August moves
          towards Jacob, almost menacingly, as he speaks;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..people want their money back when
          the Star Act on the poster isn't in
          the ring! A Star Attraction keeps a
          circus alive. Without it, animals
          eat that and men eat nothing. It
          takes time to find and train
          another horse so without Silver
          Star, I have no Star Act.

                         JACOB
          I don't know how he's been
          performing August, but you don't
          have a Star Act now. That horse
          can't walk and if he does you'll
          lose him. He's in a lot of pain.

                         AUGUST
          Like this?
          August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob
          cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly;

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          We always have choices, Jacob - a
          choice between our pain and someone
          else's. That horse was performing
          before you came and he will
          continue to perform until he drops
          dead. I'm telling you to keep it
          alive and that's what you'll do or
          you'll be red lit like anyone else
          who doesn't obey the law here.
          Every nation has it's own laws
          under God, Jacob. You left America
          the second you jumped my train. I
          like you. Believe me, I do. I'm
          only thinking of your future.
          August lets go of his arm and walks away. Jacob is angry.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          Angry, Jacob inspects his arm - swollen and red from Rex's
          mouth. He hears: O.S. murmuring coming from Silver Star's
          stall. He approaches to find Marlena sitting at Silver Star's
          head, stroking his nose and humming the lullaby.
          Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears. And Marlena
          speaks to him for the first time;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         MARLENA
          Tell me the truth. What's wrong
          with him?
          Jacob hesitates before answering, then:

                         JACOB
          The connective tissues between the
          hoof and the coffin bone are
          compromised and the coffin bone
          rotates toward the sole of the
          hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll
          puncture through...He's in a lot of
          pain.

                         MARLENA
          And if he rests?

                         JACOB
          You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry.
          Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears
          welling up in her eyes.

                         MARLENA
          Then you have to put him down.
          Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised.

                         JACOB
          It's the right thing to do.

                         MARLENA
          But August won't let you.

                         JACOB
          (Beat. Then:)
          If I'm the show's vet then it's my
          decision, isn't it?

                         MARLENA
          But August won't like it.

                         JACOB
          Then it'll be my last decision.
          Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't
          quite know what to make of him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          EXT. STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MOMENTS LATER - TWILIGHT

          A determined, pent-up Jacob marches towards Bill and Grady
          who are taking a break, smoking. Camel is drinking Jake...

                         CAMEL
          Hey kid. What are you doing on the
          wrong side of the tracks?

                         JACOB
          I need a gun.

                         CAMEL
          It can't be that bad...
          They laugh but Jacob insists boldly.

                         JACOB
          I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now!
          Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle.
          Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously.
          Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his
          intimidating stance....Performers and workmen sense a drama
          brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          Jacob jumps into the Ring Stock car with the rifle as Kinko
          exits his room with Queenie. Queenie growls.

                         KINKO
          What do you think you're doing?

                         JACOB
          Shut-up! Both of you!
          Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          You should go.

                         MARLENA
          No. I'll keep him calm.
          Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle
          and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns
          her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the
          rifle slides to his side. He looks to Marlena. This is their
          first moment of intimacy. She rises and takes the rifle from
          his grip. She sees his arm bruised from the cats. She seems
          to know what it means. She offers a respectful farewell.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr.
          Jankowski.
          She exits O.S. with the rifle.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - LATER - EVENING.

          The yaks are motionless. Flies buzz around their head and
          ears. Jacob swats them away...The Polar Bear is on his
          stomach, breathing heavily. Jacob smooths his coat....Jacob
          leans down and hoists a bucket of ice, scattering the ice
          near the polar bear who rolls closer to it.
          Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with
          thirst. He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens
          it. Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch.
          He isn't frightened. He gives Rex the bucket of water. Rex
          drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows...

                         JACOB
          Friends now?
          August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks
          to the center and stops, staring at Jacob.
          Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to
          the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence.
          Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of
          the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him.

                         AUGUST
          You've got a gift for them. Like
          Marlena with horses. It's God-
          given. I can always spot it.
          Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He
          continues on as he replies;

                         JACOB
          My father used to say that to me.

                         AUGUST
          He must have been a wise man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          This stops Jacob. Beat. He turns to August.

                         JACOB
          How is Marlena?
          August tilts his head curiously, with a smile.

                         AUGUST
          You're a genuine curiosity Jacob
          Jankowski. What am I to do with
          you? ... I threaten to throw you
          off a moving train, feed you to my
          lions and you go ahead and shoot my
          star horse anyway. So I think -
          Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob
          to disobey me and shoot that horse,
          that horse must have been in pretty
          bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to
          injure my Marlena during the show.
          And so I think Jacob Jankowski
          might be a valuable person to have
          around.

                         JACOB
          Tell Diamond Joe the animals need
          more water when the humidity's this
          bad if I don't see him before I go.

                         AUGUST
          You're not going anywhere. You
          belong here. These animals..they've
          been waiting for you.
          Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          But don't ever disobey me like that
          again. I'll give you this one. I'll
          call it "respect"...Next one I call
          "betrayal". Understood?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          I do thank you though. You and
          Silver Star solved a much bigger
          problem for me.
          August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket.

                         JACOB
          What problem?
          August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         AUGUST
          The cats. You see, meat eaters are
          always more valuable to a circus
          than hay burners. And you saw what
          we had to feed them.

                         JACOB
          What does Silver Star have to do
          with the cats?

                         AUGUST
          We should have just enough food for
          them to get us to the next show,
          thanks to you. Of course Marlena
          won't speak to me for a day or two
          but she'll come around...So, I was
          right. You are a valuable man.
          As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;

                         JACOB
          August, what did you do? August?

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE TO GOSHEN - MORNING

          Queenie sleeps. Kinko reads comic book porn inside a book of
          Aristotle's Poetics. Jacob sits on his bed thinking.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I couldn't stop thinking about
          Marlena. I didn't see her for three
          days. Our shows were cancelled and
          we kept moving because, word was,
          August found a "dead one"...
          The train wheels screech as it begins to stop. Jacob rises
          and looks out of open train car doors..

          EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN, NY - MORNING

          The train is pulling into the site of a "ghost town"
          abandoned circus; a dilapidated Big Top, broken wagons and
          tents, desolate performers walking about idly or sitting in
          the shade.

          INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - GOSHEN, NY - MORNING

          As the train pulls into Goshen, performers stick their heads
          out the window to see....Jacob sits in the open stock car
          with Kinko and Queenie:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         JACOB
          Why are we stopping?

                         KINKO
          August loves his sideshow freaks.
          There's a guy with this outfit who
          has a parasitic twin growing out of
          his chest. He dresses it in a tiny
          tuxedo and black patent leather
          shoes. No talent but a real money-
          maker with the rubes. Calls himself
          the Man and a Half. Goddamn
          August'll pay him double what he
          pays me just for the irony.

                         JACOB
          What happened to this circus?

                         KINKO
          Went belly up. Pretty common
          nowadays. Circus bosses see the end
          coming and they'd pull a runner
          with all the money. Menagerie
          belongs to the town now. August can
          get anything he wants for a song.
          Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
          desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.

                         KINKO (CONT'D)
          Most of them will never belong to
          another show. And they know it.
          August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so
          August can head straight for the Goshen TOWN OFFICIALS,
          standing beside an Oldsmobile. They exchange greetings.

          EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN, NY - LATE MORNING

          Crazy Joe is organizing the Flying Squadron to take whatever
          parts of the Fox Circus remains that they can use.
          Jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees:
          Marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom. He walks to her.
          Just as he reaches her, Marlena turns to him, looking as if
          she hadn't slept in days. Before they can speak, they hear:

                         EARL

          MARLENA! JACOB! AUGUST WANTS YOU!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN NY - NIGHT


          A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE IS POPPED OPEN...
          A deliriously happy August is walking and holding the
          champagne, pouring glasses held by Earl who then hands one
          each to Marlena, Jacob, Diamond Joe and Crazy Joe as they all
          walk towards the Fox Bros. Menagerie Tent.

                         AUGUST
          We have a new star!

                         DIAMOND JOE
          The Man and a Half?

                         AUGUST
          Nah, lousy Ringling got here first.
          But we got better! A bull!

                         JACOB
          A bull?

                         AUGUST
          A bull elephant! Her name is Rosie,
          she's fifty-three and she's
          brilliant. The best bull they had.
          I'm going to come up with a whole
          new Star Act around her and
          Marlena..

                         (TO MARLENA)
          You can ride her in the Spec from
          now on, since we have no Liberty
          Horse.
          August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset
          about Silver Star. August ignores her. Jacob notices the
          exchange between them.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          (Pours himself a glass.)
          ...Our own bull! Ringling can't
          hold that over us now. I'm
          renovating an entire car just for
          her.

                         CRAZY JOE
          Just for the elephant! But the
          bunkers are at capacity! I've got
          roustabouts three to a bunk.
          August tosses off this concern.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         AUGUST
          We'll find places for everyone. And
          when our new star sells tickets,
          we'll buy another car! We're a show
          to be reckoned with now!

                         (TOASTS)

          ...TO THE BENZINI BROTHERS MOST

          SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH!

          INT. FOX BROS. MENAGERIE TENT - GOSHEN NY - NIGHT

          CAMERA POV: Dozens of Benzini Brothers work men are
          dismantling and taking what they need...As our characters
          walk through, this crowd of working men in constant motion
          part the way to reveal:
          ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
          shoulder. Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her
          trunk down to her feet. Only her ears are smooth. She has
          deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes. She stands
          tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground.
          Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her.

                         JACOB
          She has such long eye lashes.

                         DIAMOND JOE
          She's a hundred if she's a day.
          We're lucky if she can move.

                         AUGUST
          Darling, what do you think? She's
          magnificent, isn't she?
          Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent.
          August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie
          but feels the tension between them.
          ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders.

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          You the bull man?

                         AUGUST
          No.
          (Refers to Diamond Joe)
          This is my menagerie man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          Where's your bull man? Ya got no
          bull man, I gotta tell the township
          or else they can't sell her to ya.
          August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;

                         AUGUST
          Here he is. He's my bull man..
          Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          All right. See this animal...this
          here's the stupidest Goddamn animal
          on the face of God's good
          earth....Here's your bull hook.
          You're gonna need it.
          He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long
          with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob.

                         AUGUST
          I don't believe it. The mayor said
          she was the best bull you had.

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          If she was the best bull, why is
          she the only one left? You think
          you're the first show to turn up
          picking on the bones?
          August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)
          Some elephant tramp who dropped
          dead in Genesee sold her for a song
          which still ain't no bargain cause
          she ain't done a damn thing since
          but eat everything in sight.
          (Starts to walk away)
          Well, good luck to ya. And if I
          don't ever see another dumb bull in
          my life it'll be too soon.

                         (SPITS)
          Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and
          blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his
          head in a stream of water.
          Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from
          laughing. Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He
          doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on.
          August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened.

                         AUGUST
          Joe, you and Greg come with me. We
          have to find a car to renovate.

                         (TO JACOB)
          See what you can do with her.
          They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as
          Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent. There is an
          awkward pause between them...then:

                         JACOB
          Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not
          speaking out of turn here but - but
          I had no idea they were going to do
          that to Silver Star.

                         MARLENA
          I know....Thank you.
          This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          And please, call me Marlena. I'm
          not a snob like everybody thinks.
          Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up.

                         JACOB
          Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski.
          This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth.
          Can you say Mrs. Marlena
          Rosenbluth?
          Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          You're a beauty, huh. Skin's a
          little dry, you oughta take care of
          that. First thing you notice about
          a woman's age is her skin.
          Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body.
          Marlena giggles. Jacob plays it up to make her laugh.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Are you flirting with me young
          lady? I usually like to make the
          first move...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          (Her trunk taps his head)
          I like to get to know a girl
          first...take her out. Meet her
          folks...
          (Her trunk goes lower)
          Of course, aggressive women can be
          a nice change...
          (She tickles him)
          Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob.

                         MARLENA
          I think you two are engaged.
          They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena.
          A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards
          the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
          All the workmen have left.
          Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
          There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
          three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
          come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
          them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
          attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I think Rosie likes music. That
          harmonica song is lovely.

                         JACOB
          I'm confessin that I love you.
          Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession".

                         MARLENA
          What?

                         JACOB
          The name of the song. "I'm
          Confessin' That I Love You."

                         MARLENA
          (overlaps, realizing)
          --"Confessin' that I love you."
          Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking
          Rosie, trying not to look at each other.

                         JACOB MARLENA
          Louis Armstrong. Right.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - GOSHEN, NY - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob enters. Kinko is on his bed reading his "Aristotle" but
          quickly shuts the book. Queenie growls at Jacob.

                         KINKO
          Queenie stop.
          Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW
          BED ROLL AND PILLOW, upon which sits a LETTER. He reads it:

          "MR. & MRS. AUGUST ROSENBLUTH REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR

          COMPANY IN STATEROOM 3, CAR 48, FOR COCKTAILS AND SUPPER.
          Jacob looks up to find Kinko staring at him.

                         JACOB
          What is it?

                         KINKO
          It's trouble, that's what. Not that
          I give a damn, but you're playing
          with dynamite with those two and
          you're gonna blow all of us up.
          August is the meanest sonofabitch
          I've ever met.

                         JACOB
          I admit he has his moments of
          insanity but he's really a very
          generous, charming guy.

                         KINKO
          You don't get it, do you? When
          August feeds your arm to a lion -
          that's the real August. The one
          who's generous and charming -
          that's the insane August.
          They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:

          INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see:
          August is standing before A MAN who is being held by
          Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself. The Man is
          bleeding and bruised. Various other performers and working
          men also watch the brutality;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         KINKO
          Six men got red lit last night.
          Cancelling shows and that damn
          elephant cost August. He needed to
          clean house to save on payroll...
          It's a lousy day when an animal
          gets paid and men don't.

                         JACOB
          Why are they beating him?

                         KINKO
          He hid one of the men who was
          supposed to be tossed. Word was the
          train was over a trestle instead of
          land. Nobody comes back from that.

                         THEY HEAR:

                         AUGUST
          Get rid of him. He comes back on my
          property, you can shoot him.
          August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and
          his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob
          recognizes the Man;
          It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT

          August, wearing a tuxedo, opens the door on the platform.

                         AUGUST
          JACOB! Come in, come in!
          Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car,
          with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain.
          The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask
          furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Darling, our guest has arrived.
          Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking
          radiant in a rose silk, off the shoulder evening dress.

                         MARLENA
          I'm so glad you could come. Would
          you like a beer? Or champagne?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         JACOB
          I'm not dressed for champagne.

                         AUGUST
          We can fix that, can't we darling?
          August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August
          ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain...

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          We're celebrating our new star,
          Rosie. My plan is to have the act
          ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show
          so she can start selling tickets.

                         (BEAT)
          Unfortunately we had to let some
          men go last night...
          Jacob listens to how August will explain this:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...I don't like doing it, not one
          bit. But to keep hard working men
          working, I had to get rid of lay-
          abouts and thieves who are dead
          weight. If I had the funds to pay
          them all I would, but times being
          as they are...I regret it though.
          Jacob believes him. August turns to him, with cheer:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          So tomorrow, my faithful bull man,
          we begin! But tonight - we dine!!
          Tonight, we all deserve champagne!
          August whisks the velvet curtain aside:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Ta-dah!
          A tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed.

          MONTAGE: A PERIOD SONG COVERS THE IMAGES TAKING US OVER THE

          COURSE OF THE EVENING ALONG WITH JACOB'S NARRATION:
          - Three white-gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver
          platters revealing oyster bisque, prime rib, boiled potatoes,
          asparagus in cream.
          - Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her
          porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts. Jacob can
          barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          - Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers
          more. Marlena laughs at Jacob's embarrassment when he
          realizes his plate is clean...
          - Wine is poured over and over...as the evening continues.
          - August is at the center of conversation entertaining
          Marlena and Jacob. They are drunk from the wine!

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Jacob, I want to apologize to you,
          in front of my darling Marlena so
          she can witness how truly sorry I
          am for any bit of nastiness between
          us...Running this show, the many
          pressures...It can get the best of
          me sometimes I'm afraid.

                         MARLENA
          People don't realize how much
          August does holding everything
          together. How difficult it is in
          these times. The whole company is
          like a family to him.

                         AUGUST
          Thank you my love.
          He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;

          AUGUST (CONT'D)
          From now on I shall trust your
          judgement in all things
          veterinarian. Please say you accept
          my apology.
          Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing
          Marlena smiling in agreement.

                         JACOB
          Of course I do, August. You've been
          nothing but swell to me.

                         AUGUST
          Good man!

                         (SINCERE)
          I could truly use a friend I can
          trust.
          Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more
          wine. But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt. He stands to make a
          dramatic statement. August and Marlena look up to him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         JACOB
          I have to tell you something. You
          may not trust me after you hear it.
          August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          I never took my final exams at
          Cornell. I'm not a real vet.
          Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire
          earnestness with which Jacob made his statement.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          But it's true. I never got my
          degree. I'm not a licensed vet.
          They laugh even harder.

                         AUGUST
          BAH! A worthless piece of paper
          from the ivy bush league! Of course
          you're a vet. You have the gift.
          You're idealism is just so...sweet.
          When are you going to learn that
          the rules written of, by and for
          these united states of suckers do
          not apply to us.

                         JACOB
          Not about this, August.

                         AUGUST
          All right, let me ask you - do you
          honestly think this is the most
          spectacular show on earth?

                         JACOB
          (Beat. Then laughs)
          No.

                         AUGUST
          No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our
          Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at
          the tops. And you really think the
          Tattooed Man got tattooed by
          headhunters in Borneo? He's from
          Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to
          ink himself. And you know what I
          did when the hippo died? Swapped
          out her water for formaldehyde and
          kept showing her. For two weeks, we
          travelled with a pickled hippo..

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          (Jacob & Marlena laugh)
          ..The world is run on tricks - in
          here and out there. So trust me,
          it's having a talent that counts.
          In this world, it's all that's
          real. Look at this country, these
          dead, God awful towns we play.
          Talent and illusion bringing life
          to what is dead...Even for just a
          matinee. How wonderful is that?
          Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement.
          August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          To talent and illusion!

                         JACOB
          To Rosie!

                         MARLENA
          And Silver Star.
          August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena...

                         AUGUST
          To all we love.
          He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in
          front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes.
          Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to
          dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis
          Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
          August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
          encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer,
          filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only
          laugh along.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Come on Jacob! It's customary to
          sing for your supper!
          Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them.
          August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They
          begin to slow dance, very intimately.
          Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
          chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          He looked like a different man when
          he looked at her. I said to myself,
          maybe love does that to a man. I
          didn't know much about it.
          Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively.

                         MARLENA
          Darling. Darling, please..

                         (GIGGLES)
          Gently. We have a guest.
          August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
          eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
          her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't
          respond. He remains intense...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Darling, what is it?
          August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
          control, as if searching for proof of something he can't
          trust. His grip tightens, hurting her.
          Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena
          shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          August, dear...
          She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          You don't know your own strength,
          my love.
          And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
          relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to
          cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Auggie?
          August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
          and throws himself face first on the bed.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, Jacob.
          Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs
          onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the
          curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room.

                         JACOB
          Is everything all right?
          Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she
          returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She
          cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG.

                         MARLENA
          Oh yes. He's just had too much to
          drink, that's all. I hope you had a
          good time tonight. I wanted so much
          to make things up to you.

                         JACOB
          Tonight was your idea?

                         MARLENA
          Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt
          horrible about what happened. He
          really does like you Jacob. But
          it's hard for him. He's under a lot
          of pressure. He does more than
          people realize holding things
          together.

                         JACOB
          You said that.

                         MARLENA
          Well it's true...
          (Opens her arms to him.)
          One dance before you go?
          Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when
          Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against
          her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Jankowski is Polish isn't it?

                         JACOB

                         (NODS)
          Is that all right?

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, of course, sorry...I just
          think it's interesting. I don't
          know what I am, besides August's
          wife....I grew up in foster homes
          since I was a baby.

          states by the time I was 17. I'd
          make up stories about who my
          parents were...

                         (LAUGHS)
          When I was five, I pretended for a
          whole year my mother was an
          Appaloosa mare...
          They both laugh.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I did! ... and I pretended that I
          was really an Appaloosa filly...and
          that I was just dreaming I was a
          girl and one day, I'd wake up...and
          I'd run home.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Anyway, I was a lot safer inside
          those stables than I ever was
          inside those homes...
          Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new
          route for her conversation.

                         JACOB
          What happened at 17?

                         MARLENA
          There was a parade for the circus.
          At the head, there were six black
          Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red
          tassles. So proud! So beautiful.
          And August was leading them. The
          second he looked at me, the way he
          looked at me, I knew I'd never live
          with strangers again. And the way
          he talked. Told me "I'd find a home
          in every city..welcomed in every
          town...and he'd give me--

                         JACOB/MARLENA
          -- a life most suckers can't dream
          of"!

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Ha, you too, huh?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          It's a wonderful lie, isn't it?

                         (JACOB NODS)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          But he said he'd make me a Star
          Attraction and he did. I'm pretty
          lucky he found me.
          Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out:

                         JACOB
          He was pretty lucky to find you.
          Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared.

                         MARLENA
          You're sweet to say so.
          Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject:

                         JACOB
          Pretty song.

                         MARLENA
          Don't tell him what happened...
          Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them.

                         JACOB
          Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell.
          Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him;

                         MARLENA
          That's the name of the song. "Don't
          Tell Him What Happened To Me". Ruth
          Etting. She's one of my favorites.
          Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Are you much of a wine drinker?

                         JACOB
          I have no idea.

                         MARLENA
          Maybe you should go to bed.

                         JACOB

                         (NODS)
          Where's that?
          Marlena laughs. Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         MARLENA
          Here, let me...We can't let you go
          out there all untied. A circus is a
          small town. What will people say?
          As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on
          Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena
          finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is
          enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Sweet, sweet Jacob...

                         JACOB

                         (SENSITIVE ISSUE)
          I'm not that sweet.

                         MARLENA
          (Lowers her hand)
          Good night.
          Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob
          stands still for a moment, then exits.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT

          A drunk Jacob sees the ring stock car door open, filled with
          people's legs hanging out and loud voices from within.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT

          Jacob hops up into the car. Kinko is giving a party, with a
          bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face.
          Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's
          horses, including BARBARA and another Coochie girl, NELL.
          Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks. Jacob watches. He
          admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act. At
          the end, the girls laugh and applaud. Jacob joins in:

                         JACOB

          BRAVA QUEENIE! BRAVA!
          But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop
          and growl at him. Jacob stops.
          Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare
          the drunken young man, with his shirt out of his pants. He is
          ripe for the picking! They get an idea!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         KINKO
          JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my
          friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like
          you all to make him feel at home!
          Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can
          protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in
          for the kill. Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others
          refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily,
          raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's
          empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him.

          IN BLACK OUT....WE HEAR A SCRAPING NOISE THEN SEE A SLIVER OF

          LIGHT AS A LID IS OPENED.

          INT. TRAIN CAR/CLOWN ALLEY CAR - EN ROUTE - MORNING

          Kinko opens the lid of a trunk, speaking to someone inside;

          JACOB (O.S.)
          Where am I?
          Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props
          and an open trunk containing the hidden Jacob.

                         KINKO
          Where are you right now or where
          are you in an Aristotelean context
          because right now you're in a
          trunk.
          Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and
          discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown...

          JACOB (O.S.)
          Where are my clothes? I'm not
          wearing anything underneath this---

                         (THEN:)

          OH MY GOD...SOMEBODY SHAVED MY...

                         KINKO
          Huh-huh.
          As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms.

          JACOB (O.S.)
          What the hell did I do last night?

                         KINKO
          You threw up on Barbara...And maybe
          Nell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I feel sick.

                         KINKO
          You look a little pale.
          Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:

          JACOB'S FACE HAS BEEN PAINTED AS A CLOWN.

          INT. TRAIN CARS - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the
          Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off.
          Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with
          sexy hoots and hollers. Kinko follows him, delighted.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TUXEDO PARK, NY - MORNING

          Having cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes.
          Kinko sits on his cot "reading Shakespeare" with a melancholy
          Queenie at his side. When Jacob scratches his shaven balls...

                         KINKO
          Your balls itchy?

                         JACOB

          YES THANK YOU!
          Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress.

                         KINKO
          It'll grow back. Aw come on, you
          still store about last night? Now I
          figure we're even. In fact, I
          probably owe you one. Feel free to
          borrow a book.

                         JACOB
          Let's just drop it.
          Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with Queenie?

                         KINKO
          What do you mean "wrong"?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JACOB
          I mean she's not hating me.
          Something's wrong.

                         KINKO
          (Concerned, pets her)
          Yeah, she's been like this all day.
          I don't know...she must have eaten
          something. She did her business and
          it was kind of...watery.

                         JACOB
          Her stool? Did you look at it for
          parasites?

                         KINKO

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          I don't like looking at my own.

                         JACOB
          Get some honey from the cookhouse.
          And if you can find any slippery
          elm powder. But the honey should do
          it. If not, we'll check her for
          parasites.
          Jacob starts to exit. As Kinko reads his book;

                         KINKO
          Jacob?

                         (JACOB STOPS)
          Thanks.

                         JACOB
          Sure Kinko.
          He moves to exit again. Kinko never looks up from book;

                         KINKO
          Jacob?

                         JACOB
          Yeah.

                         KINKO
          My real name's Walter.
          They never look at each other but a friendship is formed.
          Jacob exits.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CIRCUS GROUNDS - MORNING

          When Jacob hops out, he sees performers and roustabouts all
          gathered by a performer train car, huddling and discussing.
          He crosses to investigate, meeting up with August Diamond Joe
          and Mr. Erwin...

                         AUGUST
          We got big trouble. Lucinda died.
          Now we've got no center ring star
          act and no sideshow star...

                         JACOB
          How did she die?

          MR. ERWIN
          I don't know where we're gonna find
          a fat lady this late in the season.

                         AUGUST
          I don't care where you find one,
          but find one.
          (To Diamond Joe)
          Better get some kind of rig set up
          to lift her out of the car. How did
          you carry Silver Star out?

                         DIAMOND JOE
          In pieces.

                         AUGUST
          Oh yes...
          (considers for a second)
          Mmmm...

                         JACOB
          August!

                         AUGUST
          No, no, of course, don't be silly!
          Right. Well, figure something else
          out Joe but get it down for the
          performance. Put her in the hippo
          tank for now.

                         (TO JACOB)
          You better start on that elephant.
          We need her performing yesterday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          EXT. ROSIE'S TRAIN CAR - MORNING

          Out of the darkness of her car, the enormous elephant
          emerges, being led down a ramp by Jacob.

          EXT. TRAINING RING - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATE MORNING

          Jacob - cleaned, dressed and hung over - sits crossed legged
          in front of Rosie. The two stare at each other. Rosie's nose
          searching the ground for something to eat. Jacob, without
          energy or focus, his head pounding, orders her;

                         JACOB
          Rosie...Up.
          Rosie just looks at him without moving.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Up. Rosie. Up.
          Rosie's trunk starts to sniff around Jacob.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Rosie....Walk!...STEP!..Rosie STEP!
          Rosie's trunk investigates Jacob's body, tapping his head.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Rosie please. My hair hurts.
          Rosie's trunk snakes around him.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          No...No more Cracker Jack until you
          do something....Rosie!...
          Rosie curls her trunk around Jacob and slowly topples him
          sideways, turning him over as he weakly threatens;

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          I'm getting really mad now....I
          mean it...Rosie stop...
          Rosie gets the Cracker Jack from his back pocket...

          AUGUST (V.O.)
          You just can't get enough of
          somebody in your pants, can you?
          Jacob quickly gets up as August strides towards him;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          AUGUST (V.O. (CONT'D)
          Heard you had a rough night?

                         JACOB
          Does everybody know what happened?

                         AUGUST
          Yes.

                         JACOB
          Can somebody tell me?
          August suppresses a laugh.

                         AUGUST
          I'm opening the midway and the
          menagerie this afternoon for some
          extra cash before the show tomorrow
          night. We'll see how she does with
          the crowd. She got any skills?

                         JACOB
          Finding food? But I don't really
          know how to do this.

                         AUGUST
          Well, first of all, you can't do
          anything with a bull without the
          bull hook.
          August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          It's the only way to train them.
          Watch.
          Jacob steps back.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          UP!..UP!...COME ON UP!
          August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder..Jacob winces. Rosie
          lifts her foot a little.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          HIGHER UP...UP!
          August keeps jabbing her with the hook...dotting her flesh
          with blood. Jacob gets upset.

                         JACOB
          August, there's got to be another
          way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         AUGUST
          We don't have the time! She has to
          start earning her keep MOVE! UP!

          UP!!
          August stabs her other shoulder...harder...continuing to
          shout. Rosie is getting agitated...pulling away from him but
          constrained by her chain. Her eyes fearful.
          Other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as
          August strikes Rosie harder and harder. She begins to bleed.
          Jacob tries to stop August by going for the bull hook...

                         JACOB
          Please, August, let me try again.
          But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob:

                         AUGUST
          Don't tell me my business! You
          don't want to watch this, get the
          hell out! Making love to it ain't
          going to work. Besides, from what I
          hear, you're not that good at it.

                         (TO ROSIE)

          GET UP! UP!!!
          Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATER THAT DAY

          Rosie's flesh is dotted with wounds from August's bull hook.
          Jacob is applying zinc ointment to them.

                         JACOB
          I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more
          here. Hold still.
          The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the
          breeze....Rosie's trunk rises. She smells something from
          outside the tent.
          When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn
          around but her chain is still staked into the ground. As
          Jacob straightens up, he sees:
          Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull
          it up out of the ground....She then manages to turn herself
          around, her butt to Jacob. Rosie's trunk then dives down and
          up under the canvas flaps.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Rosie?

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT/MIDWAY - TUXEDO PARK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          A VAT OF LEMONADE LEFT ON THE CONCESSION STAND, which is in
          the process of being dismantled. Work men are carrying items
          back to the train.
          WE SEE: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her
          body hidden, searching for the lemonade.
          Jacob peers out to see: Rosie's trunk dip itself into the vat
          of lemonade and drink the entire contents.
          Jacob is amazed. He looks around: Workmen are some distance
          away loading the train. No one else sees her.
          Rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - CONTINUOUS - DAY.

          Rosie's trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back
          into the ground. Jacob can't believe his eyes. He laughs.

          EXT. TRAIN - EN ROUTE T0 NEW JERSEY - DAY

          As the train travels to Weekhawken, New Jersey...Jacob is
          looking out of open car to NYC skyline across the river.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          We were on our way to the
          Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr.
          Erwin still hadn't found a fat
          lady. Tickets sales were low. So
          August, ha,ha...August pulled a hat
          trick.

          EXT. STREET PARADE - WEEHAWKEN, N.J. - DAY

          August is sitting atop Rosie, smiling, waving his top hat,
          then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his
          head in respect for Lucinda. Manhattan is in the distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          A parade like you never saw, a
          funeral and a celebration, saying
          goodbye to one star, introducing a
          new one...playing those rubes dying
          to get a peek like he was rolling a
          coin over his finger tips...
          Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a
          perky, healthy Queenie down the main street. Marlena sits
          atop a Percheron, in full costume. Jacob walks astride.
          Lucinda's Wagon, carrying "the dead Lucinda", follows.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It wasn't really Lucinda in there.
          It was Barbara in a fat suit and
          wig inside the hippo den. We buried
          the real Lucinda by the railroad
          tracks between towns. Cemeteries
          cost too much. We were the only
          family she knew.
          People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and
          satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the "dead" fat lady.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          August sure was right about Rosie.
          She pulled the people right in.
          Rosie played that crowd like a pro.
          The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with
          their parents.
          As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her
          green shuttered house waving with delight. We see she has a
          abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly.

          EXT. BIG TOP - SPEC LINE UP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - DAY

          WE HEAR: The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the
          performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec.

                         JACOB
          But as soon as the Spec started, we
          all knew it was too soon for
          Rosie's debut.
          Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins
          and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          August stands beside with the bull hook. His face is cold and
          still. His fingers clutch and release the bull hook.
          The SPEC MUSIC begins and everyone makes last minute
          adjustments...Kinko and Queenie included....August shouts
          into Rosie's ear.

                         AUGUST

          MOVE! MOVE!
          Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the
          bull hook. The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top
          flap, causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie
          so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the
          Big Top flap.
          Others gasp at the near accident. August is already furious.
          Jacob senses danger ahead. He follows in, curling the edge of
          the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers.

          INT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the
          hippodrome track then stops.
          Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams
          a smile and thrusts her hands in the air, her back arched,
          her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act.
          The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling.
          Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the
          Spec to pass them by at times. She trots ahead of August and
          then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt
          awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:
          The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.
          August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,
          starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting
          comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..
          But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real
          anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.
          After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook
          sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a
          faster speed, curling her trunk in the air. The crowd cheers!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the
          dangerous pole above the entrance. If Marlena doesn't bail,
          she'll be knocked off by the pole.
          Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as
          Rosie charges toward the entrance...when suddenly:
          Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left.
          Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of
          the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
          Rosie exits the Big Top...
          For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of
          the act. Jacob wants to run to help her...
          But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the
          pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
          facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.
          Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band
          Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
          drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.
          Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll
          mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,
          she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air
          tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for
          one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
          feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.
          The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are
          thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.
          August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if
          it were all his creation.
          But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
          turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top. He follows her.

          EXT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - DAY

          Jacob rushes to her. Marlena, in pain, collapses in his arms.

                         MARLENA
          Oh Jacob...
          August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
          Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up.

                         JACOB
          August, she's hurt.
          August takes her in his arms. Barbara appears to help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         AUGUST
          I'm here, darling, I've got you.

                         BARBARA
          Bring her to my tent, it's closer.

                         AUGUST
          Jacob, send Joe for ice. You go and
          find that Goddamn bull before we're
          run out town. And take the hook!
          August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries
          Marlena O.S. Jacob, concerned, takes the hook and runs O.S.

          EXT. OLD WOMAN'S GREEN SHUTTERED HOUSE - WEEHAWKEN - DAY

          Rosie is standing in a vegetable garden calmly feeding
          herself cabbages. The owner is the OLD WOMAN who was
          delighted by Rosie in the parade. She is now screaming
          hitting her with a small garden shovel...Jacob runs up.

                         JACOB
          I'm sorry ma'am. I'll get her.

                         OLD WOMAN
          You better before she gets at my --

          AAHHH, MY TOMATOES! YOU MONSTER!!
          Rosie has helped herself to tomatoes. Jacob steps in.

                         JACOB
          Rosie, no! Stop!
          Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then
          shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth. Jacob almost laughs.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Bad elephant, that's not nice. This
          kind lady hasn't invited you.

                         OLD WOMAN

          ARE YOU CRAZY TALKING TO AN

          ELEPHANT!? SHOOT IT! BEFORE IT EATS

          MY HOUSE! I'M CALLING THE POLICE!
          She exits into the house as Rosie wraps her trunk around
          cabbages, uprooting them, as Jacob tries to battle her trunk.
          Greg arrives with a bucket he places in front of Rosie. Her
          trunk stops fighting Jacob and sniffs inside the bucket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         JACOB
          What's in the bucket?

                         GREG
          Gin and ginger ale. Elephants love
          booze. One whiff of this and she's
          not thinking about cabbages no
          more.
          (Bats her trunk away)
          ... moj malutki paczuszek?

                         JACOB
          Greg, right? Are you Polish?

                         GREG
          Grabowski.

                         JACOB
          Jankowski.
          Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket.

                         GREG
          Last show I worked, one bull faked
          a belly ache just to get the
          whiskey...Better grab the hook.

                         JACOB
          Are you a bull man? August would
          hire you in a minute.

                         GREG
          Don't want the job. Not for him.
          Besides, I'm not bull man. I just
          like big beasts.
          Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket.

                         GREG (CONT'D)
          Is she following?
          Jacob turns around to see and sure enough:
          Rosie is leaving the garden and trotting behind to catch up
          to the bucket of gin and ginger ale. Jacob's impressed.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - TWILIGHT

          The show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing
          for the aerialist act in the background.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses
          paths with August, whose face is "dark as thunder".

                         JACOB
          How's Marlena?

                         AUGUST
          A little shaky. Sore wrists.
          Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be
          fine. Did you catch the bull?

                         JACOB
          She's in the menagerie.

                         AUGUST
          Good.
          August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold
          blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing
          what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him;

                         JACOB
          August! Wait! She was good! She
          came back on her own! Besides, you
          can't do anything now! The show is
          still going on.

                         AUGUST

                         (WALKING)
          Good. The band will drown it out.

                         JACOB

          AUGUST, NO!
          Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a
          murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is
          about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the
          bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he
          really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob
          stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent.

          MARLENA (O.S.)
          Jacob!
          Jacob sees Marlena running towards him.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT

          Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as
          workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August
          screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT

          August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The
          animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions
          roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the
          entrance as Jacob runs to August.

                         MARLENA

          AUGUST...STOP!!!
          August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with:

                         AUGUST
          Get her out of here! NOW!
          Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this
          moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August
          continues to beat Rosie.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena
          can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob
          tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans
          into him. Jacob loves being this close to her.
          The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see:
          Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of
          the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He
          is kicking and struggling against them like a madman.
          Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen
          it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the
          stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes.
          Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where
          he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken.

                         JACOB
          Rosie, what am I going to do with
          you?
          Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk
          lifts and wipes at her own eye.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He
          begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket.

                         GREG
          Here this will help. Poor beast. He
          really hurt her. Told you about
          him.
          (Curses August in POLISH)
          Don't understand why a man like
          that wants to be around animals in
          the first place. He shouldn't have
          the right, if you ask me.
          Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the
          bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT

          Earl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily
          towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook. Alerted;

          EARL'S MAN
          Somebody better find Earl.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar. He moves
          through it. The stateroom is in a shambles. An open suitcase
          of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor.

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          Marlena...!
          August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks
          uncharacteristically distraught...teary eyed and unkempt.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Do you know where Marlena is? Did
          she send you?

                         JACOB
          No....What happened?

                         AUGUST
          She won't speak to me...
          He can't finish. He sits, burying his head in his hands.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...She won't let me apologize...
          She won't forgive me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          I don't know what happens to me,
          Jacob. When I saw that bull running
          wild with Marlena, I...I lost my
          mind. But it's because I love her.
          Why can't she understand that?
          (Jacob stands coldly)
          Isn't there anyone who understands?
          (Jacob remains silent)
          Ah, it's all my fault, I know it
          is. I've spent too much money on
          that bull. I can't pay the workmen.
          Our debts are piling. We're losing
          attendance at every show. I have no
          Star Attraction. I don't know
          what's going to happen to us if
          Rosie doesn't sell tickets.

                         (CONFESSES)
          If I lose this circus, I'll lose
          Marlena - I know it.
          Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light.

                         JACOB
          I'm sure that's not true.

                         AUGUST
          Maybe you can talk to her. She's
          tired of my apologies but, this
          pressure I'm under...Of course,
          that's no excuse for what I did...
          (Rubs the images away)
          ...I can't believe what I did. Is
          she all right? The bull. Rosie.

                         JACOB
          She'll be OK.

                         AUGUST
          Would you tell Marlena? And tell
          her...tell her I'll do anything.
          Anything she wants.

                         JACOB
          August, I can't...

                         (THEN)
          I'm sure she'll forgive you...She
          loves you...Anyone can see that.
          August wants to believe him. He seems more hopeful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         AUGUST
          Thank you. My friend.
          Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits;

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Jacob?
          Jacob stops and turns back as August asks:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          What were you planning to do with
          that bull hook?
          Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook. August smiles.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Ha. You look like me.
          Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on
          his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent
          man.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Maybe there is someone who
          understands me.
          August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the
          comparison. Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert;

                         EARL
          What's going on?

                         AUGUST
          Everything's fine, Earl.
          August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit.

          EXT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT

          Jacob jumps down off the platform. Confused and disgusted, he
          takes the bull hook, wedges it under the train and breaks it
          in half.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Jacob enters to find Greg still treating Rosie.

                         JACOB
          How's she doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         GREG
          Oh she's a strong one, this one.

                         (TO ROSIE)
          Jestes dobra dziewczynka
          Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment.
          Jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles.

                         JACOB
          Is she drunk?

                         GREG

                         (LAUGHS)
          She's four tons..she'll just sleep
          good.
          (Screwing ointment top)
          Potoz noge.
          Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground.

                         GREG (CONT'D)
          Masz, moja piekna
          Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a
          mint, brushing off the lint. Rosie's trunk investigates, then
          nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth.

          SUDDENLY, JACOB HAS AN EPIPHANY.

                         JACOB
          Oh my God...

          EXT. MIDWAY - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT

          An excited Jacob is leading August to the menagerie tent.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob leads August to Rosie. A curious Greg stops tending to
          Rosie. Jacob hands August a slip of paper with Polish words.

                         JACOB
          Just read those out loud. To Rosie.
          August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help...

                         AUGUST
          Rosie...da--da---

                         JACOB
          Daj.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         AUGUST
          Daj...daj..no-ge.
          Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried.
          Greg suggests, in a low whisper;

                         GREG
          Might help if he said please.

                         JACOB
          Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge.

                         AUGUST
          Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge.
          Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam.

                         JACOB
          Go on.

                         AUGUST
          (Reads and recites)
          Rosie...potoz noge.
          Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          (Reads and recites)
          Do tylu, Rosie! Do tylu!
          Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps
          backward. August is amazed. Jacob is thrilled.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell
          us was the elephant tramp who sold
          Rosie to them was Polish...
          August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth.

                         AUGUST
          We've got a new star!
          Greg remains cautious.

          PRE-LAP : LIVE JAZZ BAND MUSIC.

          INT. NEW YORK CITY SPEAKEASY - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The live band plays on a raised platform. The dance floor is
          jammed with couples.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Tables and U-shaped booths surround the dance floor. Tuxedoed
          bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of
          bottles in front of a smoky mirror.
          August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on
          their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a
          beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his
          eyes off of her.
          Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this
          wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she
          keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.
          However, she is acting distant to August.
          August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides
          next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens;

                         AUGUST
          Would you like to dance, darling?

                         MARLENA
          No, thank you.
          Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks
          the last of it. August tries to make light of it.

                         AUGUST
          We need more champagne.

                         JACOB
          I'll get it.

                         AUGUST
          No, you stay with Marlena.
          August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset.
          August lets her be. He exits O.S.

                         JACOB
          You ever going to let him off the
          hook?

                         MARLENA
          Hook? That's an unfortunate choice
          of words.

                         JACOB
          Rosie's going be great. He won't
          hurt her again. I know it.

                         MARLENA
          Jacob, what you know about August
          is pretty much nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Jacob feels put down. Marlena realizes that came out too
          brusquely. She softens, and explains with vulnerability;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          You know how many star acts we've
          had? How much money we've made and
          lost and made...? Silver Star paid
          for our new stateroom and look what
          happened to him. Everything August
          touches gets fed to the cats one
          way or another.

                         (SADLY)
          He'll never change.
          Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I want to dance.

                         JACOB
          Maybe you should wait for August.

                         MARLENA
          I want to dance now!
          She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light
          as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so
          that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone
          - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her
          hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she
          unwinds away from, like a ribbon.
          When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance -
          including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar:
          August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The
          dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage.
          Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;

          OFF CAMERA SHOUT

          RAID!! RAAAAID!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!!
          PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People
          scream, shoving their way towards the exit. Marlena is shoved
          along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob.
          Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By
          Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob
          scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are
          strangers running in every direction, people screaming..
          Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY ALLEY - NIGHT

          Jacob is thrown into the alley. People are piling into cars,
          engines are starting, wheels squealing.
          Suddenly, Marlena appears, grabbing Jacob's hand. She takes
          off her shoes. They run through back streets.

          EXT. IRON FIRE ESCAPE - NEW YORK CITY ALLEY - NIGHT

          They run under a fire escape, panting, out of breath. The
          sirens and screams of the crowd are distant.

                         MARLENA
          Lord, that was close...Aw, look at
          my stockings! And they're silk too.

                         JACOB
          I wonder if August got out...
          Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically,
          as if for no reason. They are both still drunk.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          ...I don't know how we're going to
          get home. I've never been in New
          York, have you?
          Marlena's laughing subsides as she gets an idea.

                         MARLENA
          I want to see the Empire State
          Building.

                         JACOB
          What...what about August?

                         MARLENA
          I don't know where he is, do you?
          And he doesn't know where we are.
          It's not our fault. Like you said,
          who knows how long it'll take us to
          get back.
          Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Just a few hours, Jacob. For just a
          few hours, we don't belong
          anywhere...we don't belong to
          anyone...Please.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Jacob looks in her eyes and knows he shouldn't, but...

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I was doomed.
          He smiles. Marlena beams. They run off.

          EXT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NYC - NIGHT

          A summer storm with thunder and lightening is coming towards
          them from over the Hudson River.
          Marlena and Jacob are looking out at the expansive 1931 view
          of New York City. Other couples stroll about the sky deck.
          Marlena breathes in deeply...

                         MARLENA
          I've never seen so far. Have you?
          (Jacob shakes head)
          Look at it. As far as the eye can
          see and it's nowhere near all
          that's out there.
          Jacob notices tears in her eyes.

                         JACOB
          Are you all right?

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHING/CRYING)
          Yes. No. Yes, hahaha I'm fine. I'm
          a complete mess...ha...

          THE THUNDER BREAKS AND THE RAIN BEGINS TO POUR...
          Suddenly, MARLENA SCREAMS as loud as she can, startling the
          other couples. Jacob laughs. Beat of silence, then:

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in.

                         JACOB MARLENA

                         AAAHAHAHAAHAAAHAAAAA AHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH
          The other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain
          and away from "that crazy couple".
          Marlena and Jacob stop, wet, panting, laughing from the
          release. Then, looking out at the view, not at each other...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          Marlena begins to confess what she needs Jacob to know.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Jacob? I need you to do something
          for me. Promise me you will.

                         JACOB

                         (HOPEFUL)
          Anything.

                         MARLENA
          I want you to go. I want you get
          away from us, from the show. You're
          smart Jacob. You deserve better
          than us. Leave as soon as you can
          or something terrible's going to
          happen.

                         JACOB
          (surprised, confused)
          Why are you saying this?

                         MARLENA
          It's all right. No one can hear.
          We'll never get another chance to
          say it all.
          Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what
          they're both thinking;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Nothing can ever happen with us,
          you know. It's too dangerous.
          August will never let me go. You
          don't know what he's capable of.

                         JACOB
          How can you be with a man you're
          frightened of?

                         MARLENA
          I'm not. I don't have to feel
          afraid of him if I don't feel
          anything...After all these years,
          I've learned how to do it so well.
          I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can
          manage him. August loves me. Nobody
          else ever did. Who am I to say it's
          the wrong kind of love?" .. See,
          there's no place for a woman like
          me in any decent kind of world. You
          know where they found me when I was
          a baby? ...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          ...In an alley behind a whore house
          in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper.
          No one even bothered to leave a
          note...This circus, my horses -
          this is the only kind of life I can
          have.

                         (BREAKING DOWN)
          August made a woman like me a star
          attraction...I'm lucky. And I'm
          safe...And I was fine - before you
          came.
          Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          There's nothing that can cause a
          woman so much trouble as a good
          man.

                         JACOB
          I'm not that good. And I don't want
          to be.

                         MARLENA
          Don't say that.

                         JACOB
          No, I don't. Good men don't wind up
          with much in the end except their
          goodness. Isn't worth much, is it?

                         MARLENA

                         (SADLY)
          See? ... Look what we've done to
          you already.
          She touches Jacob's face gently. Until this moment, they
          didn't realize how close they are to each other tracing
          Jacob's face with her hands, as he leans in closer...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Sweet Jacob.

                         JACOB
          You deserve as good a life any
          other girl.

                         MARLENA
          Am I still a girl? I feel so old.
          They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is
          going. As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to
          kiss in between lines;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          This can only be tonight. We have
          to go back. Promise me you
          understand.

                         JACOB
          I understand.

                         MARLENA
          Promise me you'll suffer.

                         JACOB
          I already am.

                         MARLENA
          Promise you'll look in my eyes the
          whole time.

                         JACOB
          I promise.
          Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers...With
          Marlena's back pressed against the entrance, Jacob reaches up
          and locks the door. They sink to the ground.

          EXT. FERRY - HUDSON RIVER - NYC TO WEEHAWKEN - NIGHT

          Marlena sits inside Jacob's embrace on the ferry, her head
          leaning against his chest - their hands entwined.

                         JACOB
          If I had money, if I could take
          care of you, would we be going
          back?

                         MARLENA
          You'd have to be a Rockefeller...
          August would find me. He always
          does.

                         JACOB
          Have you tried to get away before?

                         MARLENA
          Jacob you promised. You said you
          understood it was only tonight.

                         JACOB
          I know. I do....I'm sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          EXT. WEEHAWKEN FERRY PORT - NIGHT

          Jacob walks Marlena out of the port to a waiting cab. They
          stop a few feet from the cab. Jacob gives her all the money
          in his pockets. Marlena looks at him as if for the last time.

                         MARLENA
          Where were you when I was 17?
          Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls
          away and runs into the cab. Jacob watches it drive away.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE-DAWN.

          Jacob reaches the circus. Everyone is asleep.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE DAWN.

          Jacob enters the menagerie, heading straight for Rosie. He
          gets on the ground beneath her and lies down...Rosie raises
          her trunk to allow Jacob to lie beneath her.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          SAME LOCATION - DAWN
          Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up.

                         WALTER
          Why are you sleeping here?
          Somebody's looking for you.

          INT. CANVAS CAR - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE-DAWN.

          Jacob and Walter enter to find Bill and Grady hiding an
          ailing Camel in a dimly lit car. Jacob kneels down to him.

                         CAMEL
          Hey kid. How nice to see ya.

                         JACOB
          Hey, Camel. What's wrong?

                         CAMEL
          I don't know, kid. Woke up a few
          days ago and my feet was all
          floppy. Jes can't feel'em right...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)

                         (CONFIDENTIALLY)
          ...It ain't just that though. It's
          other stuff too.

                         WALTER
          Like down there...man stuff?
          Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly.

                         BILL
          What's wrong with him, doc?

                         JACOB
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          Jamaica ginger paralysis.
          Jake leg. I've seen it before.

                         CAMEL
          No such thing. Is there Doc?
          Walter looks at Camel's empty "Jake" bottle.

                         WALTER
          The manufacturer started putting
          this plasticizer in it, or
          something, to get around
          regulations that Jamaica ginger
          extract not be sold as booze.

                         (TO CAMEL)
          You're not supposed to drink this
          stuff, ya know.

                         CAMEL
          Well what the hell am I supposed to
          drink to stop the shakes? It's
          Prohibition and I ain't no Astor.

                         GRADY
          It's OK Camel. Tomorrow's payday.
          We'll get you some moonshine.

                         BILL
          Grady don't lie to the man. If men
          were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't
          have tossed four of "em between
          Boonton and Weehawken.

                         JACOB
          Four?...Will he get better?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Walter looks at him, his expression says No.

                         BILL
          We can't leave him here. They'll
          red light him for sure.
          Jacob understands. He gets an idea and turns to Walter.
          Walter understands and reacts with an adamant:

                         WALTER

          NO! NO!

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER - WEEHAWKEN - DAWN

          Walter is walking quickly back to the performer train. Jacob
          follows, trying to reason with him. Throughout the scene,
          they are looking out for Blackie's men and speaking low.

                         JACOB
          Walter, please. Blackie and his men
          only patrol the roustabout cars.
          They don't work the performer
          train. We can hide him easy until-

                         WALTER

                         (STOPS)
          Until when? What are we going to do
          with him? Shoot him like Silver
          Star? Because that's what he is
          Jacob. In a week, he won't be able
          to move his legs at all.

                         JACOB

                         (THINKING FAST:)
          He has a son in Pennsylvania. Near
          Reading. We're playing there in
          three weeks. That's all he needs.
          Walter doesn't want to do this, but clearly can't say no.

                         WALTER
          I was right about you. You're going
          blow us all up...August got home
          tonight before you and Marlena.
          People are talking.
          Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          I shouldn't be a clown. I should be
          a Goddamn fortune teller.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT/EXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MORNING

          The cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain.
          One one side: working men and the buffet table of food. It is
          made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper
          shakers.
          The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The
          tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers.
          Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee. Jacob
          approaches. He sits opposite her.

                         JACOB
          Good morning.

                         MARLENA
          Good morning Jacob, how are you?
          Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the
          table is far enough away, so they can't be heard.

                         JACOB
          I wanted to, uh...Is there any
          chance I could speak with you
          alone?

                         MARLENA
          About what? Is something wrong?

                         JACOB
          No, I...I just wanted to...Walter
          said people are talking about what
          happened...last night...

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh Jacob, champagne completely
          overwhelms my senses..I always feel
          the better for it when I abstain.
          All I remember is getting pushed by
          the crowd and then running and
          getting a hole in my stocking. I
          don't even know how I got home. I
          don't remember a thing.

                         JACOB
          Well, I want to apologize for--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         MARLENA
          Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to
          apologize for my torn stockings.
          You weren't even there.
          Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her
          upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and
          crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the
          night having great sex.
          August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long
          sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together.

                         AUGUST
          I slept like a baby after last
          night. Thank you my darling.

                         MARLENA
          August, please. We're in public.
          Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated.

                         AUGUST

                         (SITS)
          Ah, nothing to be ashamed of. Man
          and wife reuniting in the most
          sacred of marriage places.

                         (BEAMING)
          My Marlena has forgiven me. All's
          well with the world again, right
          Jacob?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          That was quite an adventure last
          night. I'm glad I didn't have to
          bail you out. How did you get home?

                         JACOB
          I don't know. I just ran.

                         AUGUST

                         (EATING)
          How did you two get separated? You
          were so close on the dance floor.

                         MARLENA
          I told you, sweetheart. We got
          pushed apart by the crowd. This
          older married couple brought me to
          the ferry.

                         AUGUST
          I'd like to look them up and invite
          them to the show free of charge...

          91.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...I'll even pay for their
          transportation. I'd pay it a
          hundred times over to anyone who
          helped my wife to safety. Thank
          goodness she had chaperones. If
          anyone had harmed her, or even
          touched her, there's no knowing
          what I might do.
          Jacob makes note of the implication. Marlena ignores it.

          EXT. TRAINING RING - ASBURY PARK, NJ - DAY

          While Jacob coaches August from the sidelines, the company of
          performers and workmen watch August command Rosie in Polish.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          ...August said he would create an
          act for Marlena and Rosie that
          would have'em line up for miles...
          August and the company are delighted when Rosie lifts her
          foot...or walks forward, then backward..

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          His accent was awful but Rosie
          obeyed without fail.
          Marlena watches, full of excitement and praise for August. He
          instructs Marlena where to stand. He commands Rosie who lifts
          Marlena up with her trunk.
          Everyone cheers and applauds. Those near Jacob pat him on the
          back, grateful that he saved the circus. Jacob smiles.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was finally a part of them.

          PRE-LAP - CHEERS AND APPLAUSE, AS ROSIE LIFTS MARLENA ONTO

          HER BACK AND WE CUT TO:

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - ASBURY, PARK - NIGHT.


          MARLENA ATOP ROSIE IN FULL COSTUME MAKING THEIR ENTRANCE TO A

          PACKED HOUSE AS AUGUST LEADS THE WAY TO CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.
          When they enter the center ring, they stop. August gives
          Rosie the command to lift Marlena down with her trunk.
          But Rosie hesitates. August commands her again, with more
          force. But Rosie doesn't move forward...she shuffles a foot
          backwards. August grips his silver tipped cane. Oh-oh...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          Jacob and other performers watch anxiously. Will Rosie fail?
          Then August turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to
          the crowd. When he back is turned, Rosie hits his butt with
          her trunk. August freezes. The crowd laughs uproariously.
          Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act. Walter
          slaps his back. Barbara kisses his cheek.
          August displays great performance skills. He turns to Rosie
          acting suspicious. Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say
          "It wasn't me".
          August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again,
          Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk. This time August
          knows it her. He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and
          shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, "No, no, no"
          Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him.
          And the crowd bursts into applause.
          August commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena with her trunk and
          places her on the ground.

          EXT. NEW EGYPT, NJ - NIGHT

          Posters of ROSIE and MARLENA highlight the act COMING SOON!
          Blackie and his men are covering up the Posters of other
          circuses and town events.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          August could have given Barnum a
          run for his money. He spent the
          payroll money on expensive posters
          promoting that act like it was
          bigger than Ringling. And we sold
          out every performance in every
          town...

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - NEW EGYPT, NJ - DAY

          Marlena blows kisses to the audience. She skips theatrically
          around the ring, with Rosie trotting behind her, August
          hovering beside.
          Marlena stops and wipes her brow, feigning exhaustion, and
          sits on a small ball.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          Rosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk. Rosie
          copies Marlena's actions, placing her enormous rear down on a
          much larger ball.
          The crowd screams with laughter.
          Marlena stands in mock outrage, wagging her finger at Rosie.
          She turns her back on her, folding her arms.
          Rosie also stands and presents Marlena with her rear end
          facing the other way. The audience loves it.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          In that center ring, Rosie became a
          guaranteed star attraction...

          INT. ROSIE'S CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob sits alone facing Rosie, in her massive stock car made
          of steel, talking to her, in Polish...

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Alone with me, telling her every
          thing I couldn't tell anyone else,
          she became the closest thing I had
          to family.

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - FRIENDSHIP, NJ - DAY

          Marlena looks back and scowls. With dramatic flair, she
          raises one foot and places it on the small ball as if to say,
          "Take that, elephant!"
          Rosie, not to be out done (guided by August's Polish
          commands) curls her trunk, lifts her foot and places it on
          her larger ball.
          Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg,
          like a ballerina's, toe pointed. She place the foot alongside
          the other, so that she is now standing atop the ball.
          Rosie waits a moment, then lifts her other front foot onto
          the ball.
          The crowd explodes! August pretends to be outraged with
          Marlena. But as showers of coins and money rain upon them,
          August and Marlena stand beneath showers of glittering coins.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          And August! Ha, August was a new
          man..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ELMER, NJ - DAY

          The workmen set up the circus with energy and renewed spirit.
          August treating them with pats on the back of gratitude.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          ..treating everybody first class,
          spreading the word his Rosie act
          would finally get the men paid..

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Jacob, Walter and a Camel enjoy a card game and moonshine.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          ..And with business so strong,
          nobody was worried about getting
          tossed, so we didn't have to worry
          so much about old Camel.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - FRIENDSHIP, NJ - DAY

          August is filling a bucket with gin and ginger ale for Rosie.

          JACOB (V.O.).
          And nothing was too good for Rosie.
          When August found out she liked gin
          and ginger ale, he made sure she
          got both every day, treating her
          like some favorite child...

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - SALEM, NJ - DAY

          Marlena does a double take, then lifts up her finger as if to
          say "I have an idea!". With a rising drum roll, she shuffles
          her feet atop the ball, moving herself around the ring...
          Rosie places all four of her feet onto the larger ball and
          rolls herself around the ring...Marlena and Rosie go faster
          and faster, along with the music...
          THE CROWD GOES WILD....August takes Marlena's hand and kisses
          it as they take their bows.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          But I didn't trust the new August.
          I kept waiting for the real one to
          show up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          EXT. ROSIE'S CAR - SALEM, NJ - MORNING

          Out of the darkness of the car, Rosie appears in the light,
          being guided down the ramp by August, who gently pets her
          trunk, whispering in her ear. Her ears flapping, she purrs
          with affection. Jacob watches.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          It was when I saw Rosie purring
          under his touch as if nothing had
          happened between them, that the
          worst thought occurred to me.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob are laughing, listening to August telling a
          story after a private dinner. Jacob glances at Marlena...

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Maybe, I was the man not to be
          trusted.
          Marlena moves to August's lap. They kiss...Jacob watches

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Marlena looked happy...And it broke
          my heart.

                         PRE-LAP AUGUST:

          AUGUST (V.O.)
          The circus is nothing without it's
          traditions..

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - SALEM, NJ - DAY

          August has gathered all the performers and trainers in a
          circle. Jacob stands in the center. Marlena beside August.

                         AUGUST
          ..It's a family. And like any
          family, when a new member is born,
          it's arrival must be greeted with
          celebration and gratitude. Now,
          we've been a little busy with sold
          out performances, thank the Gods..

                         (EVERYONE CHEERS)

          96.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..but right now I want to take this
          moment before today's show to
          gather together..We close our
          eyes..
          Everyone closes their eyes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..and we thank whoever's up there
          that sends desperate men running
          for the rails..
          Everyone laughs.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..because it was a lucky day when
          Jacob Jankowski jumped our train.
          Because of him - together with our
          beautiful Rosie and my beloved
          Marlena - we have the greatest star
          attraction in Benzini Brother's
          history. He found a way to save us
          all. And so, to officially welcome
          Jacob into the family, we open our
          eyes..
          Everyone opens their eyes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..And we give him the traditional
          Benzini Brothers baptism.

          SUDDENLY, EVERY CLOWN PULLS OUT A SELZTER BOTTLE AND DOUSES

          JACOB..BARBARA AND ALL THE GIRLS THROW HALF A DOZEN PIES INTO

          HIS FACE AND BODY. OTHERS THROW CONFETTI, STREAMERS...
          Jacob is a mess, covered in pies, seltzer and confetti. The
          company breaks up with laughter, applauds and cheers...Walter
          and Barbara bring Jacob towels, embracing and kissing him.
          The rest of the company follows suit.
          August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens
          clothing box and carries it to Jacob as August watches from a
          distance...The crowd parts as Marlena hands him the box.
          August watches Jacob open the box to find his own TUXEDO.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Now you don't have to borrow mine.
          Everyone applauds, hugging and kissing Jacob:

                         JACOB
          Thank you, August.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         AUGUST
          It's from both of us.
          Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They
          can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously;

                         JACOB
          Thank you, Marlena.

                         MARLENA
          You're welcome, Jacob.
          As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching
          from them a distance;
          August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding.

          EXT. BIG TOP - SALEM, NJ - DAY.

          Marlena and Rosie exits the Big Top. We hear tumultuous
          applause coming from inside. Jacob awaits them, as usual.
          Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and
          places her carefully on the ground. Jacob pets and commands
          Rosie to follow him, but stops when:

                         MARLENA
          I wonder if you could help me.

                         JACOB
          Sure.

                         MARLENA

                         (PROFESSIONAL TONE)
          I've planned a surprise for August.
          He's been so wonderful, don't you
          think?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          Could you make sure Rosie is staked
          in my tent after the show?

                         JACOB
          No problem.

                         MARLENA
          Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm
          sure it would be nice for August if
          you were there too.
          Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT

          Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily
          occupied with a pile of watermelons.
          Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace.
          There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine
          bottles. Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when
          Jacob enters.

                         MARLENA
          Oh, he'll be here any second.
          Jacob, can you open this for me?
          Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork.
          Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's
          hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well.

                         JACOB
          Rosie...get away....ssstop!!
          Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to
          laugh even harder when the cork pops...

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          What is this?
          Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his
          hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top.

                         MARLENA/JACOB

          OH!....SURPRISE!..SURPRISE!
          Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena
          rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him.

                         AUGUST
          Did you show Jacob the opening
          night present I gave you?
          Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace.

                         MARLENA
          (indicating the necklace)
          Oh. No...Do you see Jacob?

                         JACOB
          Beautiful.

                         AUGUST
          It looks stunning on you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          They kiss again. Marlena raises her glass of champagne.

                         MARLENA
          To August - an authentic miracle
          man because he made a star
          attraction out of me.

                         JACOB
          To August!
          August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.

                         AUGUST
          Many thanks. Forgive me for
          arriving too soon and spoiling the
          surprise.
          August takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                         MARLENA
          Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for
          you to come.

                         AUGUST
          I could go back out to give you
          more time...or better yet, yell
          RAID and clear the place out so you
          two can be alone.
          In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present.
          August gave no sign of it coming.

                         MARLENA
          What?

                         AUGUST
          I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I
          assumed that night after the RAID
          was the first time you two fucked,
          but obviously it's been going on
          longer than that.

                         MARLENA
          Auggie, you're being silly.

                         AUGUST
          Did you think I didn't know?

                         MARLENA
          August don't do this!

                         AUGUST
          Shut-up. SHUT UP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          Marlena gets frightened. August saunters over to the silver
          tipped cane leaning against the flap. He picks it up as
          Marlena and Jacob remain still. Suddenly they hear:
          Rosie peeing where she is staked. She too is frightened.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          How long did you think you could
          keep this from me?

                         MARLENA
          August, please, there's nothing-

                         AUGUST

          GO ON! INTERRUPT ME ONE MORE TIME!
          August swipes the tables with the cane, knocking all the
          platters and glasses to the floor.

                         JACOB
          We should go!

                         AUGUST
          WE!...So you two are a couple?

                         JACOB
          NO! I just don't think you're safe
          to be around a woman right now.

                         AUGUST
          A woman? This is not a woman. This
          is my wife you Ivy League lying
          piece of shit! Say, I bet the
          authorities would like to know you
          practise without a license.

                         MARLENA
          Auggie, please... Don't you see how
          much I love you?

                         AUGUST
          I see you. I see you too clearly.
          Always have. I have to admit that
          was a nice touch when you got back
          from the speakeasy. Being with me
          in our bed, after being with him.
          Covering your tracks. I should have
          known a whore only performs for a
          man like that when she wants
          something.

                         JACOB
          Marlena, come with me...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         AUGUST

          YOU DON'T EVEN DENY IT! LOUSY

          TRAMP!!
          Marlena drops the fluted glasses, crying:

                         MARLENA

          STOP IT!..AUGGIE STOP IT..PLEASE!
          Suddenly, he's quiet. He stands still. Marlena approaches him
          now, cautiously but tenderly.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Auggie? Are you all right now?...
          August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and
          concern. Jacob watches carefully. Has it passed?
          Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open
          mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August
          grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the
          table, knocking it and her to the ground. He attacks her,
          trying to rip off her diamond necklace.
          Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena.
          JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT: savagely pounding each other's faces,
          crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging
          their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each
          other as they alternately share domination...
          Marlena screams for them to stop. Rosie bellows, pulling on
          her leg chain.
          The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS.

          EXT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - CONTINUOUS - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT

          Jacob and August continue beating each other as they roll out
          into the crowd.
          August's madness empowers him. He manages to overpower Jacob
          in a choke hold. Jacob is losing consciousness.
          Because of Marlena's screams - Earl and his men run to the
          tent. Within seconds, they are pulling August off of Jacob.
          August gets to his feet. His cool expression is even more
          frightening as he re-enters Marlena's tent.

                         JACOB

          LET ME GO!! HE'LL KILL HER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          From inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)

          HE'S HURTING HER!!LET ME GO!

                         EARL
          No he won't, kid. Come on.
          Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes
          Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him.
          FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a
          louder one...Then an unnerving silence.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          See, it's over. Can we let you go?
          Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in
          degrees, until he is standing up. Walter holds his waist.

                         WALTER
          Come on Jacob. Walk away.
          With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap
          and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - SALEM, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Walter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who
          holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face. Jacob drinks from
          the jug, panting, until the pain subsides. Camel speaks from
          behind the trunks.

                         WALTER
          The only thing that's keeping you
          alive right now are the rubes who
          saw everything. August can't risk
          getting rid of you here. But you
          better not get back on this train
          when we leave tomorrow night.

          CAMEL (O.S.)
          What happened? Somebody turn me
          around. Share some of that jug!

                         WALTER
          Shut-up Camel.

          CAMEL (O.S.)
          Well, what the hell...!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk
          and see bloody Jacob.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ! Who did that to you?

                         WALTER
          August.

                         (TO JACOB)
          Is it true?
          Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He
          can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read
          between the lines....He lowers his head in despair.
          THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise.

                         JACOB
          Why are we moving? We have a
          matinee tomorrow.

                         WALTER
          Something's gone wrong.
          SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are
          on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow.
          Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK
          COMES AGAIN as we hear:

          MARLENA (V.O.)
          Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena.
          They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal.
          Marlena with a black eye. Jacob rises to her.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I
          told him I'm leaving him.

                         JACOB
          My God. Are you all right?

                         MARLENA
          Looks worse than it feels.
          (Re: Jacob's face, laughs)
          Ha, look at the two of us.
          Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's
          stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Can I have a swig of that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Walter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro.

                         WALTER
          Why is the train moving?
          Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:

                         MARLENA
          We're being run out. Apparently,
          August was so optimistic about
          money coming in for Rosie, he
          figured he'd double down and find
          himself a new fat lady to put him
          really toe to toe with
          Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin
          into town who finds this rather
          large woman in a restaurant and
          offers her the job. Except, she...

                         (STARTS LAUGHING)
          ...she was the police chief's wife.
          Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the
          jaw and we got til morning to get
          out of town.
          This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension.
          But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of
          their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans
          into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her
          out of the room for privacy.
          Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie:

                         WALTER
          Aw girl. We're all in it now.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena
          placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses..

                         MARLENA
          Why are you hiding that roustabout?

                         JACOB
          Because Blackie and his men don't
          work the performer train and
          they'll red-light him if they find
          him. He can't work anymore.

                         MARLENA
          My God.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          They come upon Silver Star's stall - empty - right before the
          door to the next car. They stop.

                         JACOB
          Does August know where you are?

                         MARLENA
          No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and
          the girls. He won't go there.

                         JACOB
          He can't find you. As soon as we
          stop - before we stop - we'll jump
          off and I'll take you to a hotel in
          town.

                         MARLENA
          And after that? August has all our
          money. Where will I go?

                         JACOB
          Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll
          find a way together. I won't let
          you go back to him. I promise.
          Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She
          embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring;

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          ..I'll call my dean at Cornell..If
          I can take my finals again, get my
          degree, I can get my license.
          They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through
          the wooden slats. Making plans...

                         MARLENA
          Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful.
          You know, I bet Ringling would take
          us both then - they'd be getting a
          vet and a star attraction - that's
          a sweet deal for them. Although I
          won't be a star but I don't care.
          I'll take no billing at all...We'd
          be safe from August if we were with
          Ringling.

                         JACOB
          Don't worry about him.

                         MARLENA
          Of course, I'd have to wait a while
          until I can work again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JACOB
          What do you mean?

                         MARLENA
          Jacob...I'm going to have a baby.
          Jacob is stunned...then confused...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          It's yours. Please don't ask me how
          I know...Is it all right? You can
          change your mind. I'd understand.
          Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all
          the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it.

                         JACOB
          Change my mind??? Oh Marlena,
          please...please be happy.

                         MARLENA
          (Cries, relieved)
          I will...I promise...as soon as I
          stop being terrified.
          Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the
          hay. She nestles in his arms.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I'm so tired.

                         JACOB
          Rest...I've got you now.
          Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning;

          FROM THE ROOF, AUGUST, BLACKIE & HIS MEN JUMP IN THROUGH THE

          OPEN STOCK CAR DOOR. THEY CHARGE INTO THE ROOM CAUSING THE

          HORSES TO PANIC. THE THUGS DRAG JACOB AWAY FROM MARLENA,

          BEATING HIM. AUGUST FORCIBLY TAKES MARLENA, HITTING HER...

                         MARLENA JACOB

          DON'T HURT HIM!!!AUGUST NO!! MARLENA! MARLENA!...

          AS BLACKIE AND HIS MEN DRAG JACOB PAST WALTER'S MAKESHIFT

          DOOR, JACOB FIGHTS EVEN HARDER TO PULL THEM AWAY FROM

          BREAKING INTO WALTER AND CAMEL'S ROOM.

          FAST CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - BRONX

          Kinko sits against the door, holding a trembling Queenie
          hearing the screams and struggle. Camel quivers in fear
          behind the trunks.

          FAST CUT BACK:

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT


          AUGUST IS DRAGGING A SCREAMING MARLENA THROUGH THE DOOR TO

          THE PLATFORM - TAKING HER THROUGH THE TRAIN BACK TO HIS CAR.

          BLACKIE BEATS JACOB WHO CRIES OUT FOR MARLENA'S SAFETY,

          HOLDING ONTO THE OPEN CAR DOORS. THE MEN BANG HIS HANDS WITH

          THEIR FISTS UNTIL JACOB LOSES HIS GRIP AND BLACK TOSSES HIM

          OFF THE FAST MOVING TRAIN.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - GRAVEL/GROUND - NIGHT


          JACOB ROLLS DOWN THE GRAVEL. BLACKIE AND HIS MEN JUMP OFF THE

          TRAIN AND RUN TOWARDS HIM. JUST AS JACOB GETS TO HIS FEET,

          THE MEN REACH HIM - AND BEGIN TO BEAT HIM.

          WITH A SINGLE BLOW TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD, JACOB IS THROWN

          INTO BLACKNESS.

          EXT. WOODS/STREAM - ALLENTOWN, PA - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A heavy rain pours. A bloodied, battered Jacob is semi-
          conscious face down in a stream in the woods.
          Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of
          unconsciousness. He looks up through blurred vision.
          Through the trees, he can see A DISTANT FLICKERING RED LIGHT.
          He stands. His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground.
          He stands again. And he walks out of the woods towards the
          flickering light.
          He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using
          all his strength to get himself out of the woods.

          EXT. CLEARING TO TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing. Squinting
          through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          THE FLICKERING RED LIGHT IS A SIGNAL LIGHT ON A TRAIN TRACK.
          He walks, with legs barely able to move. He climbs up the
          gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk...

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - PRE DAWN

          Jacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of
          Marlena's train. He has walked all night and into the day.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY

          Jacob - beaten, bloodied, exhausted - looks up ahead:
          THE BENZINI BROS. TRAIN and THE BIG TOP TENTS already set up.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY

          It's pre-matinee. All the tents have been set up. The rubes
          are filling the grounds. The midway is packed with people.

          EXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Nell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the
          heat when she sees:
          Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can
          see him....Nell watches as Jacob tries to reach the train,
          then falls unconscious.
          Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window. Barbara sees Jacob
          and immediately takes charge.
          Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as
          they walk through the car...Barbara is organizing a plan with
          the girls.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Nell and two Coochie Girls hold their robes closed as they
          walk among the crowd. The Coochie girls head for Blackie and
          his security men...They talk to them to distract them.
          We see Nell approach Walter in full clown make-up doing
          tricks with Queenie for the crowd. Nell whispers to Walter.
          His expression tells us what we know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          EXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - DAY

          Barbara and the Tattooed Man sneak to the fallen Jacob with a
          blanket. They turn him over, shocked by his condition.
          Jacob's eyes open - he's delirious.

                         BARBARA
          Poor Kid...Help me with him..

                         JACOB
          (delirious to Tattoo man)
          Don't you work the matinee?

                         TATTOOED MAN
          Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re-
          ink.

                         BARBARA
          Don't talk.
          Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Jacob opens his eyes. Walter is applying wet cloths to his
          head. Camel watches nearby. Jacob suddenly rises;

                         JACOB
          Marlena!!

                         WALTER
          Sshh. Lie back.

                         JACOB
          Where is she? Did he hurt her?

                         WALTER
          I don't know. Your pupils are two
          different sizes.
          Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins.

                         JACOB
          I have to get Marlena. What if he--

                         WALTER
          Jacob, look at me. You've got a
          concussion and you're on a moving
          train. There's nothing you can do.
          Marlena can handle him. She's done
          it for years...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         JACOB
          I have to get her.

                         WALTER
          Jacob, you can't.

                         JACOB
          She's going to have a baby.
          Walter is stopped. Camel shakes his head.

                         WALTER
          Does August know?
          (Jacob shakes his head)
          What have you done to us?

                         JACOB
          We're going to Ringling. Me,
          Marlena. You can too.

                         WALTER
          I'm a fifth rate clown when second
          rate circuses are folding all over
          the place. Doesn't put me on top
          of Ringling's list. They've got a
          dozen of me in the wings. I
          couldn't even go if I wanted to.
          August won't pay anyone. Says the
          show's debts have to come first.
          First time in Benzini Bros history
          performers haven't been paid.
          People are starving out there,
          Jacob. In the United States of
          America. Starving. Where am I going
          to go?

                         CAMEL
          What about family? Like my son.
          Gotta have somebody...a mother.

                         WALTER
          Not a woman I have any use for.
          She's sold me to this outfit when I
          was 13.

                         CAMEL
          She sold you?

                         WALTER
          I'm not exactly cut out for farm
          work. Don't worry about me..

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          ..If you and Marlena go, if August
          doesn't kill you first - I'll know
          what to do...I'll tell August how
          well I got to know you and how I
          can help him find you. Might even
          get myself a better room out of the
          bargain... It won't be anything
          personal, you understand.
          Beat. Each wants the other to survive at any cost.

                         JACOB
          Do whatever you have to, Walter.

                         WALTER
          You too, Jacob.
          They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye. Walter turns
          away from Jacob, holding Queenie to his chest.
          Camel looks compassionately at Jacob and says:

                         CAMEL
          Ya poor kid. The night this train
          passed ya...you shoulda kept on
          running, I guess.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Camel and Walter are snoring, asleep with their backs to
          Jacob. Queenie is asleep, nestled in Walter's arms.
          Jacob struggles to raise himself up. His world spins. He
          holds tight to the bedroll, until the spinning subsides.
          Jacob is a man with a mission. His eyes focus on: Walter's
          Knife, sticking out from beneath Walter's pillow.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          The train is moving fast. The rain has returned.
          Jacob is making his way towards the back of the train, as it
          moves forward. He holds the knife in his mouth...moving like
          a tightrope walker over the wet train roof, as rain pours.
          When he reaches the car's end, he takes a deep breath. With
          all his strength, he leaps across the divide between the cars
          and lands, clinging to the top rail, panting like a dog.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip. He
          licks the blood back and replaces the knife, this time
          keeping his lips retracted.

          JACOB MAKES HIS WAY ACROSS SIX CARS...LEAPING FROM CAR TO CAR

          BY LANDING ON THE ROOF, GETTING TO HIS KNEES THEN TO HIS FEET

          AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT...


          EXT. ATOP MARLENA AND AUGUST'S STATEROOM CAR - NIGHT

          Jacob leaps to the roof of Marlena and August's car. At this
          moment, the train is making a curve.
          Jacob climbs down over the side ladder. Beyond him, we see:

          THE TRAIN IS TRAVERSING OVER A TRESTLE, FORTY YARDS ABOVE THE

          BOULDERS OF A RIVERBANK ILLUMINATED BY MOONLIGHT.
          Jacob jumps to the platform. He can see the rocky waters far
          below the trestle. He catches his breath and waits, as the
          train straightens out onto land again.
          Jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom, slowly,
          hearing a click, pausing, then opening it.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob enters the stateroom, leaving the door open. He creeps
          towards the velvet curtain which is closed. He grips the
          knife. When he reaches it, he pulls the edge and peeks
          inside.
          August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena,
          who is awake facing the curtain.
          Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet. She sees the knife in his hand
          August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest,
          burying his face in her neck.
          Jacob steps forward, raising the knife. His hands tremble.
          The moonlight glints off the blade, throwing off light.
          Marlena is looking up at him, tears in her eyes. She subtly
          shakes her head "NO"...She doesn't want him to do this.
          Jacob's hands are shaking now. The knife gripped in his hand.
          He wants to rescue her, he's so close. We hold the moment...
          Marlena's expression convinces Jacob not to do it...not to
          cross that line and kill August.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head. Marlena
          reaches out to touch him...this time she really is saying
          goodbye. But Jacob can not bear it. He looks at her for the
          last time, then rises and exits.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Jacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the
          roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them...
          And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He

                         APPROACHES;

                         JACOB
          Walter? Camel?

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM/ RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible
          realization comes over him:
          Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted.

                         JACOB

          WALTER! CAMEL!!
          He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He
          takes her in his arms. Jacob panics.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          No..no..no..no....!!!!
          With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he
          checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the
          open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob
          collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes
          as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving
          train, his worst nightmare realized.

          POV; IN THE DISTANCE, THE TRESTLE THE TRAIN PASSED OVER

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I wanted to believe taking Walter's
          knife didn't make a difference. But
          still. I left him without a
          fighting chance. Maybe they
          survived. Maybe they were tossed
          over grassy land...I couldn't let
          myself believe what I already knew.
          Jacob falls apart, crying without shame.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING

          A sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk,
          rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I waited almost til matinee time so
          I could let myself be seen by as
          many people from town.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING

          Jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding
          Queenie. He hasn't slept all night.
          As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg
          and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive.
          With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his
          men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right
          up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed
          and ready for the matinee's performance.
          Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at
          Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing.

                         JACOB
          I'm not here to cause any trouble.
          I'm leaving.

                         AUGUST
          Funny, I thought you already left.

                         JACOB
          I'd like to say goodbye. To the
          menagerie. Just a few minutes and
          then I'll go.
          August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          There's nothing more you can do to
          me. Killing me'll be more trouble
          than it's worth, now that the rubes
          have seen me. You were right about
          me from the start August, when you
          said I wouldn't last...I can't
          survive here...

                         (THEN)
          I am nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          August feels victorious and therefore benevolent.

                         AUGUST
          Earl, take him to the menagerie.
          Thirty seconds. Then escort him out
          of my circus, into Altoona. And if
          he comes back, you can shoot him,
          as that is within our lawful rights
          with regards to trespassers.
          August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On
          the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to
          her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - MOMENTS LATER - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          Jacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back
          at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk
          greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her.
          Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more...
          After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in
          the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their
          den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time
          saying goodbye.
          Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at
          Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters.

                         EARL
          Come on kid.
          When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:

          ALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING

          THEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR

          BELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE.
          The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it.

          EXT. SIDESHOW TENTS/MIDWAY - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          As Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience
          members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low.

                         EARL
          It's good you're going. They must
          have known you got back on the
          train last night. He tossed more
          than half a dozen working men.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So
          that was meant for you.
          We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          A few of the guys that got tossed
          caught up with us again.

                         JACOB
          Walter! Is he---?
          Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
          Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;

                         EARL
          Keep walking...They got tossed off
          the trestle, if you can believe it.
          Camel's head hit the rocks. He died
          right away...
          Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
          pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          ...Walter...Walter's legs were
          smashed up real bad..They had to
          leave him.

                         (BEAT)
          They don't reckon he lasted the
          night.
          Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on...

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          The ones that came back...Bill...
          Grady.. I don't know how but, one
          way or another they're taking down
          August tonight.
          Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl.

                         JACOB
          Why are you telling me?
          Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these
          men does not sit well with him.

          SUDDENLY, WE HEAR THE BIG TOP MUSIC COME TO A CRASHING HALT,

          FOLLOWED BY AN UNGODLY COLLISION OF BRASS THAT FINISHES WITH

          A CYMBAL'S HOLLOW CLANG.
          Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Earl, what was that?
          All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert.

          WE HEAR THE BIG TOP BAND START PLAYING AGAIN...THIS TIME IT'S

          "STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER".

                         EARL
          Oh Christ! Oh Shit...
          Earl runs back towards the Big Top.

                         JACOB
          What is it?

                         EARL
          The Disaster March!
          Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg
          appears amongst them and calls to Jacob:

                         GREG

          JACOB! IT'S THE MENAGERIE!! THE

          ANIMALS ARE LOOSE.

          JACOB RUNS THROUGH THE PANICKED CROWD, THE GROUND RUMBLING

          BENEATH HIS FEET...THE SOUNDS OF HOOVES ON HARD DIRT.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung
          up against the sidewall as:

          THE YAK THUNDERS PAST HIM, HIS HORN INCHES FROM JACOB, THE
          HYENA ON HIS BACK. Jacob looks to the menagerie and faces;

          A FULL FLEDGED STAMPEDE:

          - ALL THE ANIMAL DENS ARE OPEN.

          - CREATURES OF EVERY SORT...CHIMP, ORANGUTAN, LLAMAS, ZEBRA,

          LION, GIRAFFE, CAMEL AND HORSES... RUN IN A MAD TERROR AS

          THEY SCREECH, SCREAM, SWING, WHINY AND ROAR...

          - MONKEYS ARE SWINGING ON ROPES, SLITHERING UP POLES

          - THE CENTER CONCESSION STAND IS CRUSHED UNDER FOOT.

          - A TOWERING POLAR BEAR SLASHES WITH HIS SKILLET-SIZED PAWS,

          MAKING CONTACT WITH THE LLAMA, KNOCKING IT FLAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.
          Jacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when:

          - THE ORANGUTAN RUNS THROUGH THE STAMPEDE DIRECTLY TO JACOB

          AND CLUTCHES ONTO JACOB'S LEG. JACOB MOVES TO PICK HER UP

          WHEN BOBO SWINGS FROM A ROPE AND JUMPS ONTO JACOB'S BACK.
          Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in
          the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena:
          Then Jacob sees - THE PANTHER MAKES IT'S WAY THROUGH THE

          CONNECTED WALKWAY TO THE BIG TOP AUDIENCE.

          - SECONDS LATER, AUDIENCE SCREAMS OF TERROR ARE HEARD. THE

          CROWD EXPLODES THROUGH THE BIG TOP, TRAMPLING OVER FELLOW

          AUDIENCE MEMBERS...THEY CHARGE INTO THE MENAGERIE ONLY TO

          FACE THE STAMPEDE..

          - THE MASS OF ANIMALS CHANGE DIRECTIONS AND THERE IS AN INTER-

          SPECIES FLOCK; LIONS, LLAMAS AND ZEBRAS RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE

          WITH THE CHIMPS AND ORANGUTANS..A HYENA SHOULDER TO SHOULDER

          WITH A TIGER...TWELVE HORSES AND A GIRAFFE WITH A SPIDER

          MONKEY ON IT'S NECK...THE POLAR BEAR NOW ON ALL FOURS,

          CHARGING...ALL OF THEM HEADING FOR THE CROWD OF PEOPLE...

          - THE CROWD SHIFTS, RIOTING BACK INTO THE BIG TOP. CLOGGING

          THE ENTRANCE...PEOPLE BANGING ON THE BACKS OF THOSE IN FRONT

          OF THEM..

          - THE CLOG BURSTS. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS FLEE IN EVERY

          DIRECTION...

          - A BENGAL TIGER FORCES ITSELF BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS,

          SWEEPING HER TO THE GROUND...
          Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink
          sequins. He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in
          front of Rosie.

                         JACOB

          MARLENA!
          Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August
          quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground. She falls
          out of view from Jacob.
          Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when
          suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE
          ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER. He cries out.
          Rosie cries out. She begins to stamp her feet. Marlena lies
          with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get
          under Rosie for safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          119.
          August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the
          ground. August glares at him, his eyes full of rage;

                         AUGUST

          YOU! YOU DID THIS!!
          He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the
          bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples
          August who refuses to let it go...
          JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like
          madmen fighting with the intention to kill.
          Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in
          him, as he beats August without mercy...
          But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own
          maniacal fury. By taking advantage of the bull hook wound,
          August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck.
          Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede
          around the two men locked in combat.
          Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do.
          Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie. She
          raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees
          that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND.
          Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is
          holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The
          chain still attached to her foot.
          Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on
          Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob.
          Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see.
          Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him

                         AS:
          Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it
          down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She
          continues to hold the stake until August topples forward,
          dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg..
          Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just

                         BEFORE:

          A HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST, CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.
          Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head
          hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear
          of the stampeding animals.
          Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining
          under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to
          Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive.
          WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing,
          Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's
          dead body.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          The polar bear is walking calmly down main street.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          It took days to round them up. Some
          we never did get back.

          INT. HOUSE - CHILDREN'S ROOM - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          Two Children are delighted that a GIRAFFE is eating from
          their second story window.

          INT. RESTAURANT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          Camera discovers a DISHWASHER and REX THE LION, both
          quivering, huddled opposite each under beneath a sink.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I don't know who was more scared -
          the rubes or the animals.

          EXT. NESCI BROS. TRAIN - CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          THE NESCI BROS. CIRCUS TRAIN is pulling up alongside the
          "ghost town" of the Benzini Bros - the ruins of the circus
          are highlighted by strong winds blowing up dust and dirt.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          When the Nesci Bros. Circus showed,
          we were officially belly up.
          A MAN SCREAMS after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery
          inside. A crowd forms. When Jacob reaches it, he sees:

          BLACKIE, DEAD, WITH A MAKESHIFT GARROTTE AROUND HIS NECK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          DICK NESCI and the Sheriff fight with Jacob over Rosie...

                         SHERIFF
          ...These animals are now the
          property of Altoona and we're here
          to sell them to Mr. Nesci.

                         JACOB
          Not all of them! Some of these
          animals are mine, like this bull.

                         DICK NESCI
          Do you have any proof?
          Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.

                         GREG
          He's right. He's just an elephant
          tramp. The bull is his.

                         JACOB
          You don't want her anyway. She
          can't do anything. Dumb as a box of
          peanut shells.
          Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie.

                         DICK NESCI
          What's her name?

                         JACOB
          Gertrude.
          Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact. Nesci is skeptical.

                         DICK NESCI
          Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP!
          Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the
          people around her.
          Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg,
          ordering her UP! Rosie just swings her ears and sniffs Dick
          Nesci with her trunk. Then checks his pockets for treats.
          Jacob exchanges a look with Rosie.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          122.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATER - DAY.

          Jacob is walking Rosie, holding the Orangutan, with Bobo
          atop Rosie. Through the wind and dust, they look for Marlena.

          FROM OUT OF A WALL OF WIND BLOWN DUST APPEARS MARLENA AND SIX
          OF HER BLACK AND WHITE HORSES. Marlena looks spent - shocked,
          relieved, tearful, hopeful. She reaches Jacob.

                         MARLENA
          What happens now?

                         JACOB
          I wish I knew.
          Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over.
          WIDE ANGLE: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant
          tent of the Benzini Bros. Big Top falls to the ground.

          INT. CHARLIE'S TRAILER - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

          Jacob is finishing his story. Charlie is enthralled. The
          first bottle of scotch is gone. The second half full.

                         JACOB
          I convinced my dean to let me take
          my finals. Marlena was right. With
          my degree, our animals and
          Marlena's acts, Ringling got a
          sweet deal. Our son was born our
          first season. We named him Walter.
          He spent the first seven years of
          his life with Ringling.

                         (BEAT)
          That's why I...I just can't
          understand how he forgot to show up
          today.
          (His eyes glitter

                         CHILDLIKE)
          There was a circus in town.
          Charlie understands. He looks affectionately at Jacob.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          By the time our third son came,
          we'd had enough. Rosie was tired.
          (Charlie smiles. )
          Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo
          dropped dead, so I got the job.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          We bought some property so we could
          keep the horses...Rosie...then five
          kids...Bobo and that
          Orangutan...Never named that
          Orangutan. Nothing ever sounded..
          elegant enough for her. Just called
          her Ma'am.
          (Smiles with great joy)
          Man oh man that was...that was a
          life, boy, I'll tell ya...
          Charlie smiles, appreciating this old man's big life.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          And then before you know it, the
          kids are borrowing the car and
          moving out. Marlena and I on our
          own again...until she passed.
          This moment causes Jacob to pause. He still loves her.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          I never told Marlena it was Rosie
          who got August. I didn't want her
          to know. When Rosie passed on, she
          cried for days. I owe that bull my
          whole life...my kids, everything..
          A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP:

                         CHARLIE
          It's the heat.

                         JACOB
          They're here for me.
          Charlie and Jacob exchange a look. Charlie understands.

          INT/EXT. TRAILER DOOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Charlie opens the door to greet a LOCAL COP.

                         CHARLIE
          Hi Officer, can I help you?

                         COP
          Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly
          gentleman went missing from the
          nursing home down the street. Staff
          seems to think he came here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          124.

                         CHARLIE
          We had a lot of folks from the home
          today. But no, I haven't seen him.
          The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob.

                         COP
          Excuse me, but who is that?

                         CHARLIE
          (Pause, then)
          Oh....that's my Dad.
          The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          He can't talk. Had a major stroke a
          few years back. But he's doing
          well. Ain't ya Pop?
          Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
          stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He
          reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him.
          Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps
          him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob
          swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool.
          Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:

                         COP
          OK, well, thanks for your time.
          Here's my number in case you hear
          of anything. Sorry to bother you.
          The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They
          consider this unspoken proposal:

                         JACOB
          You sure about this?
          Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:

                         CHARLIE
          I wonder if we can get you into the
          book of records. "Oldest man who
          ever ran away with the circus".

                         JACOB
          Nah, I'm not running away. Just
          coming home.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          125.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

          Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie. He moves to
          each animal meeting his eyes with theirs. Each animal gives
          him a look of acknowledgment.
          He comes to an ORANGUTAN...younger than the one from his
          Benzini days. Jacob stops. He steadies himself.
          Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the
          Orangutan's cage.
          The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging.
          Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him.
          The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to
          Jacob's hand.
          Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand. They
          hold for a moment. Jacob smiles.

                         JACOB
          Thank you, Ma'am.

          1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1

          A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly
          floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath.
          Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern
          India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and
          beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall
          clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing
          beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives
          way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we
          are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and
          onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of
          utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny
          shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald
          rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing
          lights. The camera slows, and hovers.

          2 EXT. SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 2

          Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed
          wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight.
          Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber
          buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and
          all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided
           barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall. 

           SUPER: 'SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA, 1940'.

          3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3

           A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two
           tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal
           stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A
          dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 
          to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear
          scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in
          prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian
          territories, still ear something of their national 
          costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners
          from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages
          drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of
          types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving
          and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each
          other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men
          are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or
          'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that
          has put them here.
          Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a
          group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.
          These men look healthier, and are further distinguished
          by their tattoos.

                         (CONTINUED)

          These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular
          criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters
          of the block.
          Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily
          tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent,
          BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this
          criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made
          cards.
          [All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED,

          EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH].

                         BOHDAN

                         (IN RUSSIAN)
          What've you got?
          VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines
          it briefly.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          Think I want your stinking lice
          farm?

                         VALKA
          Polish tailor.
          He shows the label.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          See? From Krakov. Good as new.
          BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden
          suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts
          his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of
          sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the
          coat.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          And the sausage.
          BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I
          swear. I hope you die with an axe
          in your skull, and your balls
          ripped out.
          The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no
          reaction.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          OK. For the bread.

                         (CNNTTNTTFD )

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3
          BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with
          the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid 
          plays, VALKA is left coat-less. 
          Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,
          the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just
          entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,
          SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other
          ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes
          three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes
          them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.

                         BOHDAN
          For the bread.

                         VALKA 
          For the bread, and the sausage, 
          bastard! 
          BOHDAN enjoying himself. 

                         BOHDAN 
          Throw in that crappy shirt you're 
          wearing and I might be tempted. 
          Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but
          he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage.
          Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a
          tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking
          across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again
          VALKA loses.
           VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his 
           bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then 
          offers to BOHDAN. 

                          BOHDAN (CONT'D)
           I don't play for regulation issue
           crap.
          VALKA lights a cigarette. 

                          BOHDAN (CONT'D) 
           All done, Valka? 
           VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil 
          of cool. 

                          VALKA 
           I go on credit. 

                          BOHDAN 
           'Credit'? 

                         (CONTINUED)

          VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by
          a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          You're already in debt.
          VALKA's anxious eyes. They settle on SMITH by the stove.
          He speaks in carefully articulated English.

                         VALKA
          Come here.
          SMITH returns the stare, then slowly approaches.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Take off your coat.
          A silence, the criminal gang sensing a showdown. There's
          something about SMITH, something steely, unpredictable.
          The fire crackles loudly. SMITH all the while holding
          VALKA's stare.

          [THE DIALOGUE RETURNS TO RUSSIAN.]

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Worth shit!
          He looks at SMITH's companion.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You.
          ANDREI goes pale, removes his coat to reveal a decent-
          looking patterned wool sweater. He offers the coat.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Let's have the sweater.

                         ANDREI
          Take the coat.

                         VALKA
          I want the sweater.
          ANDREI doesn't move.

           VALKA (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
          Your babushka make it for you?
          Come on, hand it over.

                          
          ANDREI is visibly shaking.

                         (CONTTNTTFD )

                         ANDREI
          You have no authority, here.
          VALKA gets up, moves slowly to ANDREI, a smile on his
          lips. Then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his
          trousers deeper into his boots, reaches for something,
          and in one slow balletic movement, swings up and
          stretches out his hand to ANDREI, and ANDREI sobs and
          leans to one side.

                         BOHDAN
          Was that really necessary?
          In the dim light ANDREI's face is grey as he sags to the
          floor. None of the other prisoners move to help him, nor
          do they show any sign of concern, as VALKA places the
          knife back in his boot and returns to the game. YURI
          steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man,
          handing it on to VALKA, who passes it to BOHDAN. BOHDAN
          examines it professionally, wipes a little blood off his
          hands.

                         BOHDAN (CONT'D)
          OK. For the sausage.
          The game resumes.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:

          4 EXT. GRAVEYARD, FOREST NEAR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 4

          Freshly dug graves. Close on one of these, stones piled
          in a mound over the grave. Hands into frame moving aside
          the stones. Wider to see two PRISONERS, breath steaming
          from their mouths, as they work quickly and quietly to
          uncover the grave. The older of the two is KHABAROV,
          late thirties, the other, LAZAR, late twenties. Furtive
          looks over their shoulders as an occasional blade of
          light from the watchtower throws them into silhouette.

                         KHABAROV
          Here he is.
          He reaches out to touch a human toe poking out of the
          rocks.
          As they work -
          Close on the face of ANDREI, as they continue to uncover
          his body.

          He's not frozen yet, that's lucky.
          The remaining stones are removed to find the corpse
          dressed in nothing but underwear.

                         LAZAR
          Damn! Picked clean! Bloody
          thieves.

                         KHABAROV
          Keep your voice down, be grateful
          there's anything left.
          They reach into the grave to retrieve the underwear.

           LAZAR's hands in water, some kind of tin sink, water
           running red as the underwear is rinsed clean of blood.

          5 EXT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105 - DAWN 5

           A Soviet guard beats a hammer against a hanging length of
          iron.

          6 INT. BARRACK BUILDING - SAME TIME - DAWN 6

          Close on the barrack stove, the underwear drying,
          KHABAROV's hands into the frame.
          As the prisoners rise, follow a hand to hand exchange of
          the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV
          having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR.
          Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps
          half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for
          two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the
          men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one
          piece of bread, concealing the rest in a hiding place in
          the dirt at the base of his bunk - a glimpse of a cache
          of hoarded food and other items.

          The saved morsel he places on his tongue, and closes his
          eyes. He doesn't chew, just lets it dissolve like the
          Eucharist. Then it's gone in a slow swallow and he opens
          his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he
          hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at
          his hand. Close on a spot between his fingers - there's
          a crumb there. Into frame, the tip of his tongue as it
          slowly and carefully retrieves the tiny speck of bread.

          7 EXT. LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - DAWN 7

          The camp seen in a distant view - surrounded by double
          wire, a collection of weathered timber buildings with
          watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the
          perimeter. In the distance, dense forest.
          Entering frame a column of close to a hundred men march
          toward the camp. Following behind is a lorry, carrying
          six guards, supplies for their recent journey, and a camp
          stove.

          8 EXT. CAMP GATES - DAWN 8

          As they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch
          stretching across the gates - a hand-painted sign in
          Russian subtitled: 'LABOR IS HONOR, GLORY, NOBILITY, AND

          HEROISM'.
          The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a
          look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. 
          ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast,
          marching toward them on their way to work. They have
          their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns
          pass each other the contrast between the half-starved,
          ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of
          the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we
          are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse
          some of those already established - they include BOHDAN,
          and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As
          they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both
          Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian
          with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a
          blanket over his three-piece suit. Beside him, another
          Pole - KAZIK, at seventeen, the youngest in the group.

          9 EXT. 'THE ZONE', CAMP 105 - DAY 9

          The newly arrived prisoners assemble between the various
          buildings - an area known as the 'ZONE'.

                         9 CONTINUED: 9
          The camp is being expanded, and everywhere are piles of
          cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing
          old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones.
          The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into
          slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the
          Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks
          with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new
          camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and
          the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently
          issues an order dismissing him.
          The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of
          documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received
          them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys

          Later, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house,
          heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of
          others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash-
          house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort
          through their belongings, pocketing the odd item.
          JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut.
          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on
          replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed-
          wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a
          section of the old wall falls to the ground.

          14 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, THE ZONE - NIGHT 14

          The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the
          side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful
          eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of
          thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no
          bowl, so he uses his hat.
          JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window.
          Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners
          feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a
          hand on the shoulder of the man in front.

          SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on
          hearing English spoken.
          As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men
          scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into
          the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd
          scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime,
          then lick them clean.

          SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a
          hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips
          it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of
          the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage-
          eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him,
          placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches
          as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats
          it, his every move watched by the starving man at his
          feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man
          who greedily drinks it. SMITH and JANUSZ stare at each
          other.

          JANUSZ surprised by the American accented English.

                         (IN ENGLISH)
          He's an old man.

                         SMITH
          I'm an old man. But I'll be alive
          in the morning. He won't.
          He goes to move away, hesitates, turns back to JANUSZ.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          'Kindness'. That can kill you
          here. You'll learn that.
          He places the last morsel of bread in his mouth, and
          chewing slowly, turns and walks away.

          conversation here and there but most have withdrawn into
          themselves, just glad to have survived another day.

          toward a barrack building where the bodies of several men
          who died overnight are being carried out and laid on the
          ground - among them the 'garbage-eater' from the night
           before. JANUSZ glances over toward SMITH who stares

          saws drifting from the forest floor.
          JANUSZ and his friends - VOSS, TOMASZ, KAZIK and ZORAN -
          work at trimming felled trees of branches, and then
          sawing them into lengths.
          SMITH and his gang work nearby. He watches JANUSZ
          peeling strips of bark from a pine-tree and stuffing them
          in his pocket.

           On the valley floor, below towering cliffs, some 150 men
          haul rocks in wooden wheelbarrows from the mine entrance
          across a maze of tracks to waiting trucks.
          A fire blazes in a 44 gallon drum set up in an open-sided
          wooden shelter. Here BOHDAN and his criminal associates
          supervise the work. VALKA has fallen on a slippery slope

          JANUSZ and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay
          by the mine entrance. He hesitates as the others move
          away, staring into the black hole leading into the
          mountain. Eerie sounds drift up from deep below. A look
          of utter dread on his face.

          contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from the
          mark showing at the top of the storage bay.
          BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working
          gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's
          group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV
          leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ.

          a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes
          buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears
          away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut
          timber.

          the old logs to their pile and to conceal them inside the
          fresh cut logs.

          They just make it, but BOHDAN notices the end of an old
          grey log poking out from the center of the stack. He
          stops his measuring of their quota. A tense moment, then
          he nods and leaves. KHABAROV crosses from his gang to
          join them.

                         JANUSZ
          He knows.
          KHABAROV shrugs.

                         KHABAROV
          He knows, but he doesn't care, as
          long as his arse is protected.
          This is 'Tufta'. Bull-shit.
          JANUSZ nods his thanks.

          The long march back to camp. JANUSZ peers left and right
          toward the beckoning forest. Beside him ZORAN senses his
          friend might just take off then and there. He places a
          restraining hand on his arm, as a guard's voice drifts
          through the still air:

                         23
          VOSS and KAZIK are by the stove unwinding their long foot-
          cloths that most wear in place of socks. KAZIK hangs the
          damp cloths on the stove to dry and sets out to examine
          his toes, which are in poor shape, suffering the early
          stages of frostbite. TOMASZ sits nearby sketching the
          scene on a sheet of birch-bark, using a piece of 
          charcoal. 
          WIDER to see VALKA, looking on in admiration. TOMASZ is
          uneasy despite the implied compliment. VALKA hands him a
          sheet of paper, and the stub of a pencil.

          24 A BUNK NEAR THE STOVE - SAME TIME 24
          BOHDAN lies on his bunk, surrounded by several of his
          tattooed henchmen listening to a story. The storyteller,
          looking rather uncomfortable, is ZORAN. His Russian is
          good but for a moment his memory fails him as he
          desperately tries to recall the next beat in the story.

                         BOHDAN
          Keep going and you'll get some
          bread - so how does this 'Long
          John Silver' find the treasure?

                         YURI
          I knew a type like that. Remember
          Igor? He had one leg.

          Shut up.
          (Then to ZORAN)
          Go on.
          The story resumes, ZORAN giving it all he's got, when
          VALKA appears a sketch in his hand. He passes it to
          BOHDAN. CLOSE on the sketch - a lusty naked woman.
          VALKA makes a gesture implying masturbation. BOHDAN
          examines the drawing before licking the back of it,
          lifting his shirt, sticking it to his chest, then
          lowering his shirt again. He waves VALKA away.

          25 JANUSZ'S BUNK - SAME TIME 25
          CLOSE on a shirt.
          The shirt lies on JANUSZ's bunk and it's moving. A tiny
          subtle movement, but just perceptible, the movement
          caused by hundreds of lice.

          WIDER,
          to see this is JANUSZ's view, KHABAROV there too,
          watching over his shoulder.

          He picks up the shirt and walks toward the door of the
          barrack, indicating JANUSZ should follow. As he passes
          his bunk he scoops up his own shirt.

          26 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - NIGHT 26

          KHABAROV leads him toward the wire. From somewhere deep
          in the bowels of the earth, a low sinister rumbling, the
          very ground itself shaking momentarily. JANUSZ stops,
          while KHABAROV keeps walking.

                         KHABAROV
          The mines. They blast at night.
          He pauses to let JANUSZ catch up, then looking furtively
          about him, he crouches by a drift of snow.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          Shirt.
          JANUSZ hands him his shirt. He scrapes a hole in the
          snow, buries the shirt, leaving only the tip showing. He
          does the same with his own shirt.

                         JANUSZ
          We're going to leave them here
          overnight? Why?

                         KHABAROV
          You'll see.
          JANUSZ stares up at the wire, then to a distant
          watchtower, its searchlight briefly illuminating him.
          KHABAROV follows his eye-line.

          associate, overseer of
          construction.
          He nods toward an area where stockade wall is being
          replaced with double wire.

                         KHABAROV (CONT'D)
          Few ever escape the camps. I've
          waited for someone like you,
          someone with the strength and will
          to see it through.

          have no idea where we are.
          KHABAROV squats down, JANUSZ joins him, and smoothing out
          a drift of snow KHABAROV sketches a map of a lake and
          indicates the location of the camp.

                         KHABAROV
          We believe about 500 kilometers
          north of Lake Baikal.

                         JANUSZ
          We could follow the edge of the
          Lake, it runs due South.

          Why wait?

                         KHABAROV
          It's 1000 kilometers to the
          border, maybe more. We need
          careful planning, stock-pile food.
          I've already begun - trading,
          dealing. You could do the same.
          In the Autumn the weather is

          snows to cover our tracks.

          At the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the
          bodies of those who have died overnight is underway. The
          corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial.
          JANUSZ pauses, a muttered prayer on his lips. Then he's
          passing the hospital barracks - the usual crowd of
          desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted, to be
          excused another day of the killing work, the majority
          turned away. He joins the line at the kitchen. The

          prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed
          guards who will escort them to work are waiting. GUARD
          NO. 1 begins counting them again. It's much colder than
          usual, prisoners beating their arms to keep warm, a high

          The freezing wind has picked up considerably, driving
          sleet against the column of prisoners, forcing them to a
          halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the
          guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'?
          The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse,
          their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them.

           Could go badly for you.
          The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to
          stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The
          GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other
          guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on
          the freezing ground. All but SMITH.

          The GUARD is about to leave when to his astonishment, and
          that of the other prisoners, SMITH begins to walk toward
          the forest edging the road. The GUARD draws his pistol.
          On the ground ZORAN lies beside JANUSZ, as they watch the
          unfolding drama.

          their rifles, waiting for his order to fire. He is
          conflicted, and after a tense moment gestures for them to
          lower their weapons.

          watches as VOSS picks up a massive log, places it on his
          shoulder and carries it to where JANUSZ is supervising
          the building of their shelter. Most of the other
          prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of
          sticks to make windbreaks, but JANUSZ is building
          something more elaborate. SMITH's eyes miss nothing as
          he notes JANUSZ's skill and the way the others work as a
          team under his direction.

           JANUSZ calls KHABAROV to join them, but he declines
           politely. He moves on to find SMITH - invites him back
           to their improvised shelter. As SMITH sits, ZORAN offers
           his hand.

                          ZORAN
          You are brave man - Dragan Zoran,
          Yugoslav this is Janusz

          (It's a League of Nations.)
          English our common language!
          SMITH nods.

                         JANUSZ
          And you're ?

                          SMITH
          Smith.

                         JANUSZ
          Your first name?

                         SMITH
          Mister.

                         JANUSZ
          Mister Smith?

                         SMITH
          That's right.
          As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into
          his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He
          hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews
          on the bark. The others follow his example.
          Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He
          takes note of the group as future troublemakers.

          AD30 INT. BARRACKS - DAWN AD30 

           The men are stirring, struggling up to face another day, 
           when the door opens, and in a flurry of snow, GUARD NO. 1 
           enters with another soldier. He orders SMITH, JANUSZ and 
           his group to fall out. As he passes SMITH - 

           GUARD NO. 1 

                          (IN RUSSIAN) 
           You don't like being out in the 
           cold, do you Cowboy? 
           And as he moves away SMITH mutters to JANUSZ. 

                          SMITH 
           Might as well have shot us 
           yesterday. 
           JANUSZ and the others look at him. 

                          SMITH (CONT'D) 
           We're for the mine. 

          30 INT. MINE - DAY 30

          A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the
          frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures
          working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled
          sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet
          deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more
          sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the
          most time in this frozen hell.
          The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ
          shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses
          to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves
          into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks,
          the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the
          cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand
          was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately,
          fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia.
          Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead.

          31 INT. DEEPER IN THE MINE - DAY 31

          KAZIK and a man known as 'THE PROF', drag a cart laden
          with rock up a steep incline. They wear horse collars
          attached to the cart by leather harnesses.

                         31 CONTINUED: 31
          THE PROF's wasted frame and sallow complexion are in
          contrast to his lively intelligent eyes. He says
          something to KAZIK in Russian. He shakes his head. He
          doesn't speak Russian. THE PROF tries German, then
          English.

                         KAZIK
          English, yes.
          They share a smile.

                         PROF
          I was only saying, these collars -
          the same used by ancient Egyptian
          people.

                         KAZIK
          Yes, but on their horses probably.

                         PROF
          No. Same. On people.

                         KAZIK
          How do you know that?

                         PROF
          I was professor of Egyptology.
          Leningrad University.
          KAZIK manages a look at his companion, before putting
          even more effort into dragging the load.

          32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32

          A man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long
          pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it
          easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the
          'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe-
          stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along
          pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to
          warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when
          the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their
          hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth.
          SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot
          here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to
          see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant
          mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted
          against the light. He watches a moment, something not
          right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries
          after him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          33 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 33

          JANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls
          to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the
          ground.

          JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY 
           Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.
          He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.
          Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a
          hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.
          His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the
          path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,
          then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A
          pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the
          wall.

          34 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 34

          CLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him,
          grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an
          adjoining tunnel.

                         SMITH
          Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.

                         JANUSZ
          Got to get out!
          SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake
          with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back
          to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands
          around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH
          bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to
          JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its
          effect.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          It can be done.

                         SMITH
          What can be done? 

                         JANUSZ
          He knows a way through the wire.
          SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point-
          Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.

                         (A WHISPER)
          He has a plan.

                         SMITH
          Who?

                         JANUSZ
          His name is Khabarov.
          Now SMITH understands.

                         SMITH
          The actor.

                         JANUSZ
          You know him?

                         SMITH
          He has no intention of escaping.

                         JANUSZ
          What?

                         SMITH
          He's aliar. Been here foryears
          -seeksout new arrivals, mewhen
          Ifirstcame here. He justlikes
          totalkabout escape. I'veknown
          others like him.

                         JANUSZ
          Why should I believe you?

                         SMITH
          (shakes his head)
          Nothing is for nothing in the
          camps. From you he gets your
          energy, your spirit. You feed his
          'dream' of escape. You help keep
          him alive. He's no more than a
          leech.

                         JANUSZ
          You're a cold bastard, Mister.

                         SMITH

                         (SHRUGS)
          I'm still alive, that's all I
          know. But I won't be in six
          months. And neither will you.
          Not in the mines. So, if you're
          serious about making a run for it -
          I'm in.

          I thought you were a loner?

                         SMITH
          Can't be done alone. Besides you
          have a weakness that could be
          useful to me.

                         JANUSZ
          And what's that?

                         SMITH
          Compassion. If anything happens
          to me, I'm counting on you
          carrying me.
          JANUSZ knows he's not joking.

          35 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, SAME TIME - NIGHT 35

           It is snowing heavily, and after swallowing their soup, 
           JANUSZ and his friends walk back to the barracks. KAZIK 
           stumbles, and is helped to his feet by VOSS. He limps on 
           to the barrack a hand resting for support on VOSS' 
           shoulder. JANUSZ is preoccupied and he hesitates at t he 
           door, turns, and looks back. After a moment staring at 
           the ground he hurries inside. 

          36 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 36

          JANUSZ has a puzzled KHABAROV by the arm, guiding him
          back to the door.

          37 EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 37

          He points to the ground - CLOSE on footprints as they
          rapidly disappear under the heavy snowfall.

                         JANUSZ
          Tonight.
          KHABAROV looks from the footprints to JANUSZ, a horrified
          look on his face.

                         KHABAROV
          It's a passing storm!

                         JANUSZ
          It'll do, it'll cover our tracks.

          The timing will never be perfect, 
          they won't expect it now!

                         KHABAROV
          But the distances! And food!
          What about food?

                         JANUSZ
          We've been trading, the American
          is with us. He has food, you have
          food.

                         KHABAROV
          How long will that last?

                         JANUSZ
          I've spent half my life in the
          woods and mountains. We'll live
          off the land.

                         KHABAROV
          It can't be done!
          JANUSZ shocked at the change in his friends' demeanor,
          the appalling realization that SMITH was right about him.
          He seizes his arm.

                         JANUSZ
          How do we get through the wire?

                         KHABAROV
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                         JANUSZ
          Your friend, Lazar, he knows
          doesn't he?
          A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face. Someone behind
          JANUSZ. JANUSZ turns. VALKA, a few paces away watching
          them. KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks.
          JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows.

          A38 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT A38

           In the last minutes before lights out the would-be
           escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other 
           items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and 
           BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and
           most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades
           more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries 
           to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in 
           poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK 
           does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is 
          doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS
          whispers to him.

                         VOSS
          You can't see, can you?
          A look of panic crosses the boy's face.

                         KAZIK

                         (WHISPERS)
          Don't leave me behind!
          VOSS conflicted.

                         KAZIK (CONT'D)
          Promise me, Andrejs! I could keep
          a hand on your shoulder by night,
          and in the day I can see just
          fine. I won't hold you up.
          Please don't tell them. I'll die
          here.
          JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on
          LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire.
          He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from
          his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the
          deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging
          the barracks into darkness.

          AB38 EXT. THE CAMP - NIGHT AB38

          Several shots of the wind driven snow whipping about the
          buildings.

          38 INT. BARRACKS - LATER THAT NIGHT 38

          The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea
          as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The
          sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,
          hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.
          CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,
          KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,
          catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.
          KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected
          sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at
          the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be
          attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving
          about near him, a look of terror on his face.

          LATER,
          JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A
          movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his
          throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his
          cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.

                         VALKA
          There are no secrets here.

                         JANUSZ
          What do you want?

                         VALKA
          The game goes against me. Small
          debt - lose fingers. Big debt, 
          they take head. Me, big debt.
          But one thing I never gamble is my
          Wolf.
          He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the
          blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In forest you need knife to 
          survive. Without? A miracle.
          He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          You need a knife, and I need
          miracle to get me out of here.
          With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers
          and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?

          39 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAWN 39

          Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward
          the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight
          isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards.
          They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and
          baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs
          into the gap, then following them toward the distant
          forest.

          40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40

          Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and
          out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them,
          as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with
          JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt,
          occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his
          feet fast enough to keep up with the others.
          JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the 
          moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before 
          plunging on Southward. 

                         41 FURTHER ALONG 41 
          They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their
          breath. The snow continues to fall but JANUSZ will allow 
          no rest and moves off without a backward glance. 

                         42 FURTHER STILL 42
           JANUSZ is out in front when SMITH stops, resting his 
           hands on his knees, gulping for air. The others stop
           too, VALKA dropping to his knees. JANUSZ runs back to 
           VALKA, drags him to his feet. 

                          JANUSZ
           Get up. Or we die right now. You
           know how fast dogs travel. 
           He turns to the others. 

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D) 
           Run, damn you! Run! 
           He moves to SMITH. 

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Is it time for me to carry you?

          SMITH waves him away, gets up and continues.

          43 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - DAY 43

          A feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The
          snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep
          depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no
          further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight
          is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS.
          In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They
          look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the
          sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen
          timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle
          in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to
          VALKA, whispers.

                         JANUSZ
          Knife .
          VALKA has never taken an order from a 'Political' in his
          short life.

                         VALKA
          What?

                         JANUSZ
          Your knife.
          With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his
          knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ.
          While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims
          fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to
          make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They
          go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their
          digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a
          meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to
          cover their hide.

          It's like an Indian sweat-lodge as the fugitives sit
          shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle, ears straining,
          sweat running down their faces. The voices closer still.
          A tense moment, and then they are passing, the voices
          fading into silence.

          47 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, SIBERIA - NIGHT 47

          The strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally, and
          as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the
          snow from throat and lungs. VALKA, his arm wrapped
          defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his
          knees. JANUSZ turns back, drags him to his feet. KAZIK
          hangs onto the back of VOSS' coat, VOSS at times
          literally dragging him along.

          With VALKA's knife JANUSZ cuts a square of bark, pulls it
          from the tree, cuts two triangular holes some centimeters
          apart, then rams the base of the bark piece into VALKA'S
          collar. It's a crude mask.

          49 EXT. THE PROCESSION, FOREST - NIGHT 49

          The group, all now wearing the improvised snow-masks,
          push forward against the wind, looking like a tribe from
          some distant age dressed in ceremonial masks.

          JANUSZ in the lead, some fifty paces ahead, but he's
          stopped, thigh-deep in the snow, as still as a statue.
          The others catch up, puzzled. SMITH calls to him, lifts
          his mask. He's asleep. SMITH shakes him back to
          consciousness, all the while the storm continues at full
          force.

                         SMITH
          We've got to make fire!

                         JANUSZ
          No! You saw how close they were!
          KAZIK sinks to the snow, then ZORAN.

                         SMITH
          We die either way, might as well
          die warm.

          A51 EXT. FOREST, LATER - NIGHT A51

          A hole scraped out of the snow and a wind-break of fallen
          timber, is all they can manage in their exhausted state.
          Down in the hole JANUSZ is striking a spark from a flint.
          Some are fading fast, KAZIK keeps falling asleep, to be
          shaken awake by TOMASZ. MR. SMITH is splitting wood into 
          ever finer shavings, ready to feed a nascent fire. Still
          the damp kindling will not catch.
          They draw closer together for warmth, draping their arms
          over each other's shoulders. ZORAN's head drops to his 
          chest. TOMASZ shakes him.

          The other look to ZORAN, and fighting the desire to
          sleep, he begins. VALKA loves a good story, and despite
          their desperate situation he listens with the attention
          and concentration of a small child.

                         ZORAN
          Once upon a time, in the days of
          wooden ships, there was a great
          storm in far away seas. A
          merchant ship hurried toward big
          rocks, lightening in the sky, the
          waves as high as house-tops.
          Very, very cold, brrr! The ship
          smashed onto the rocks, the
          sailors cried in fear, called out
          to God, but they all drowned. All
          but one, Mr. Robinson Crusoe. He
          woke to find himself all alone on
          a desert island. For many years
          he lived without any human
          companions, until one day he saw
          something shocking! What was it?
          A human footprint. He was no
          longer alone. But was the
          stranger friend or foe? Another
          ship wrecked sailor? Or, a
          cannibal?
          All turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the 
          kindling. While JANUSZ blows at the flame, MR. SMITH 
          feeds in small shavings. The group watch with the awe 
          and wonder usually reserved for child-birth. Then
          everyone is making a contribution - adding a few leaves,
          or tiny twigs, like offerings, as the fire grows and
          spreads.

          AB51 EXT. FOREST, CAMPFIRE - DAWN AB51

          A comfortable blaze, the group, minus JANUSZ, sleep or
          drowse in the life-giving warmth, when a pile of snow
          lands on the fire. The others react. It's JANUSZ. He
          heaps on more snow and the fire sputters out.
          By the time the others are on their feet JANUSZ is almost
          out of sight and they hurry to catch up, fearful of being
          left behind.

          limbs. VALKA looks up to find SMITH staring at him.

                         VALKA
          You stare at me like the snake at
          the rabbit or is it the other
          way 'round?
          VALKA turns to the others with a silver-toothed smile,

          a thumping sound outside. The group go very still. A
          second thump, overhead this time. VALKA draws his knife.
          A trickle of snow falls through the vent in the roof.

          Alright, let's see what you've
          got.
          No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets,
          emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of
          bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a
          swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store
          of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of
          small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ,
          KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare
          grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items
          are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of
          barbed-wire, etc. SMITH picks up the barbed wire,
          examines it.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Valka?
          VALKA reluctantly reaches into his coat - something
          familiar about it with its distinctive fur-lined collar.

          Yes...and...
          From the sack he produces KHABAROV's hoarded supply of 
          food and other items. Off JANUSZ's reaction -

          worry. I talk to him. Everything

          We share.
          JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances
          at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already
          begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of
          VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They
          eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the
          fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a
          thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats
          daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a
          tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions.

          The group in the shelter of the trees. The sky is
          overcast but at least it's not too cold. Everywhere
          about is deep snow from the recent storm. TOMASZ
          prepares a meal from their dry rations, small portions
          for men who have expended so much energy. KAZIK examines
          his swollen blistered feet. VALKA has his boots off,
          shaking them.

          VALKA (TO KAZIK)
          Clean inside boots, foot-cloths.

          With lengths of wood as 'ski-poles', the group begin to
          make up lost time. VOSS has lashed his rope-belt to
          KAZIK who walks behind him. SMITH wonders about this,
          but says nothing. They pause at the top of a rise
          amongst the trees, on hearing the sound of dogs howling
          from behind.

           JANUSZ a short distance away. He plants his 'ski-pole' 
           in the snow, marking the tip of its shadow with a pine- 
           cone. They watch as he draws a line in the snow from the 
          second marker - about a foot in length. Then he stands,
          and with the toe of his left foot at the first pine-cone
          and the toe of his right foot at the end of the line in
          the snow, he points, calling to them.

                         JANUSZ

           They move off down toward a distant valley, ZORAN the

           of seemingly endless forested hills stretching before

          up with his 'Pakhan'.

          The fugitives settle for the coming night. As TOMASZ
          unpacks their meagre food supply JANUSZ sketches a map on
          a piece of birch-bark. The other sit exhausted, some
          close to sleep, except SMITH who is working the piece of
          barbed wire from KHABAROV's stash.

          Most gather wood while TOMASZ, the 'quartermaster', makes
          their meal, and JANUSZ the fire. VOSS keeps an eye on
          KAZIK who, demonstrating his independence while it's
          still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a
          load of wood, turning back into the forest for more.
          Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take
          up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc.

          find food like the others.

                         ZORAN
          You do the shutting up! Drawing
          like you're on holiday. I'm sick.

                         TOMASZ
          I cook. They find food. What do
          you ever do? Nothing!

                         ZORAN
          I make them laugh.

                         TOMASZ
          Not any more.
          ZORAN turns away from him, curling up into a foetal
          position.

           SMITH walking through the vast cave, his attention caught 
           by two massive holes in the roof. He walks on toward 
           their camp outside an opening at the far end. 

          73 EXT. CAVE - DUSK


                          73 
          TOMASZ has water boiling on the fire. He calls to the

                         OTHERS -

                         TOMASZ
          What do you have? Come on, no
          holding back.
          SMITH approaches from the cave, hands over two small
          fish, his day's catch. VOSS steps forward with a dead
          squirrel. VALKA has nothing. TOMASZ reaches for their
          cooking pot cooling by the fire. He passes a cup to

          JANUSZ.

                         TOMASZ (CONT'D)
          Pine-needle tea.

          JANUSZ sips, reacts to the bitterness of the brew,then
          passes it on. 

          74 EXT./INT. CAVE - NIGHT 74

          Sleeping figures by the fire. TOMASZ tosses and turns,
          muttering in his sleep. JANUSZ is awake as is VALKA who
          sits close beside him. A whispered conversation -

                         VALKA
          Who will be first?
          JANUSZ looks at him.

                         JANUSZ
          You mean the first to die?
          VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ.

                         VALKA
          I think that sucker, the artist.
          But better if it was him.
          He nods toward ZORAN.

                         JANUSZ
          It might be you.
          VALKA shrugs.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Why 'better' if it's Zoran?
          VALKA squeezes the flesh of his upper arms.

                         VALKA
          More soft. More tender.
          JANUSZ shakes his head, 'no'.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Mister only gets little fish now. 
          We must have meat, or we die. 
          You're the Pakhan, you've thought
          of it. We all have. That's why
          you brought extra people isn't it?
          For food? An old Urka escape
          trick. I swear to God you were an
          Urka in another life.

                         JANUSZ
          We'll get food when we get to Lake
          Baikal, plenty of fish there.

          You said we should have seen Lake
          a week ago. We're lost, Pakhan.
          JANUSZ stares into the fire as VALKA lays down to sleep.

          A75 LATER, NIGHT

                         A75
          It is ZORAN's turn on watch and he stands near the
          entrance to the cave, his blanket about his shoulders,
          looking out into the still night. Behind him a low
          growling sound, coming from deep in the cave. He turns,
          a look of terror on his face. He can see nothing but a
          dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates
          through two large holes in the cave roof. He wakes
          JANUSZ, alerting him to the sound. JANUSZ in turn wakes
          VALKA, and after taking burning sticks from the fire they
          walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the
          sound, VALKA drawing his knife.

          75 INT. CAVE - NIGHT


                          75 
          The dim light shows a wolf-pack growling as they pick at
          a carcass on the cave floor. They drop their bones and
          face the intruders, baring their fangs, all now growling.
          On a signal from JANUSZ they rush the wolves, who run
          back toward another exit from the cave. MR. SMITH,
          TOMASZ and VOSS come hurrying to join them, woken by all
          the barking and shouting.
          VALKA falls on part of the carcass, cutting off chunks of
          raw meat. The others do likewise. Wider on the group,
          down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill,
          only JANUSZ stands back, watching them.

                         76

          EXT./INT. CAVE - EARLY MORNING 76

          Some sleep on, others stir, their movements slow and
          listless. They are near the end. This has been JANUSZ's
          point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his
          pockets and picks up his staff. Those awake stare at
          him.

                         JANUSZ
          I'll be back in a week - if I find
          the lake. If not, you're on your
          own.

                         VALKA
          I come too.

          I'll travel faster alone. Mr.
          Smith will be the Pakhan while I'm
          gone.
          JANUSZ turns and with a nod of the head 'follow me', to
          SMITH, he moves off.

          77 EXT. SOME DISTANCE FROM CAMP - DAWN 77

          Now out of earshot, JANUSZ turns to SMITH. SMITH knows
          what it's about.

                         SMITH
          I know. Valka.

                         JANUSZ
          Don't let him out of your sight.

                         SMITH
          Good luck.
          As JANUSZ heads off into the forest.

          78 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY, SIBERIA - DAY 78

          A magnificent vista - a broad plain sweeping toward a
          distant line of hills. It's a beautiful clear day and
          the lone figure of JANUSZ, dwarfed by the landscape,
          walks steadily Southward.

          79 EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DUSK 79 

          Sheltering from the wind on the leeside of a hill, he
          takes pine-cones from his pocket, breaks them open and
          eats the seeds. Then he's up and off again, leaning
          heavily on his staff.

          80 EXT. A BARREN PLAIN - DAY 80

          The weather changes from a clear Spring morning to cold
          and overcast as gusts of wind whip down from distant
          slopes. JANUSZ bends into the wind, his pace slowing.
          He stumbles, sinks to the ground, fighting the desire to
          let go, to give himself to sleep, and the swift death
          that will surely follow. His eyes begin to close. Then
          he sees it. Just ahead of him. The gate. The gate from
          his vision in the mine. He struggles to his feet,
          staggers on -

                         80 CONTINUED: 80
          JANUSZ'S VISION: A repeat of his earlier hallucination -
          the click of the gate latch, the flagstones at his feet
          as he moves down the path. (All the while the
          accompanying sound is of JANUSZ's laboured breathing in
          the present 'reality'). He's at the front door, camera
          pans to the loose brick in the wall beside the door.

          81 EXT. CAMPSITE, FOREST - DUSK 81

          JANUSZ staggers back into camp, half dead and shivering
          with cold. VALKA is quickly beside him with SMITH and

          VOSS.

                         JANUSZ
          Three days from here. South by
          West.
          He collapses. VOSS shouts for the fire to be built up,
          hot water to be boiled. He feels his pulse, checks his
          eyes.

                         VOSS
          Stones! Gather stones! Heat them
          in the fire!

          82 EXT. CAMPSITE, STILL LATER - NIGHT 82

          Throughout the night they take turns replacing the hot
          stones surrounding his body and massaging his feet and
          hands. On one such occasion SMITH finds himself at
          JANUSZ's side. JANUSZ opens his eyes.

                         SMITH
          What's the 'brick'?

                         JANUSZ
          What did I say?

                         SMITH
          Something about a loose brick.
          JANUSZ nods, offers no explanation.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You know if you don't pull through
          soon we'll have to leave you.

                         JANUSZ
          I expect nothing less.

          you want to see home again.

                         JANUSZ
          We could've used you in the Polish
          army. Fired you out of a cannon.
          He closes his eyes, lapses back into a deep sleep.

          It's a beautiful evening as the file of travellers climb
          toward the crest of the hill.

          85 EXT. MOUNTAIN, SIBERIA - DUSK 85 

           From the crest, a panorama of Lake Baikal - a massive 
           body of water stretching to the horizon. 
           The fugitives rest, and consider the next stage of their

          SMITH signals JANUSZ to stop, while holding a finger to
          his lips for silence. JANUSZ joins him, followed by the
          others.

                         SMITH
          We're being followed.

                         JANUSZ
          Followed? Where?

          own. May have seen us - crossed
          into the trees beside the track.
          A silence as they consider their options. VALKA draws
          his knife.

                         VOSS
          No killing.

                         VALKA

                         (TO VOSS)
          No? I think you've killed before.
          You say too many prayers for an
          innocent man.
          VOSS looks uneasy.

                         SMITH
          He gives us away, the soldiers
          will be on us in no time.

          Valka, go back on the other side
          of the track, then come up behind,
          in case he makes a run for it.
          VALKA moves off, gliding through the trees on the left of
          the track. The others wait a beat, then move into the
          trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen
          timber as weapons.
          JANUSZ is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces
          ahead, a figure steps out from behind a tree. JANUSZ
          stops, holding up a hand for the others to stay where
          they are. He stares at the small figure - a young woman.
          There's a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat, a
          scarf tied loosely about her neck. Wisps of chestnut
          hair stray out from under a moth-eaten fur hood. She
          looks frightened and desperate.

          The men discreetly drop their irovised weapons. She
          looks ready to make a run for it on seeing VALKA with his
          drawn knife. JANUSZ gestures for the others to fall
          back, as he cautiously approaches, uttering reassuring
          words.

          The others sit smoking by the pathway, watching as JANUSZ
          crosses back from the GIRL to join them.
          He says something to TOMASZ in Polish. A rapid exchange
          between them.

          for several days.

                         VALKA
          What does she want?

                         JANUSZ
          Food? Protection? She's been too
          afraid to approach us until she
          was sure we weren't Russians.

                         SMITH
          She wants to travel with us?

                         JANUSZ
          She's on the run, like us.
          Escaped from a Russian collective
          farm.

                         VALKA
          I swear to God I know this type -
          street gypsies, there are
          thousands like that, less use than
          a dog!
          JANUSZ looks back to the GIRL who watches them from the
          clearing.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Pakhan. Don't do this.

                         JANUSZ
          She's starving.

          Zoran?

                         ZORAN
          Maybe it's kinder to leave her.

                         VOSS
          She's been sent to us. We can't
          leave her.

                         SMITH
          We have no choice.
          JANUSZ knows this is true.

          90 EXT.THE CLEARING, WOODS - DAY 90

           The GIRL watches as JANUSZ approaches. From the way he
           doesn't look at her she knows their answer. JANUSZ
           stands before her a moment. They speak in Polish (sub-
          titled).

                         JANUSZ
          I'm sorry.
          He reaches into his bag, passes her a fish and some nuts
          and berries. It's all she can do to refrain from eating
          it right away.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D) 
          What will you do?

                          

                         THE GIRL
          Go back.
          He guesses at what this might mean.

                         JANUSZ
          If we had enough food
          She stares at him, nods, then walks back toward the path,
          returning in the direction from which she came.

          91 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - DAY 91

          The group walk in silence, the encounter with the girl
          and their subsequent decision weighing heavily on some.
          VOSS keeps looking back over his shoulder.

          LATER, the group walking out in the open by the lake when
          their attention is caught by the sight of a flock of
          ravens circling and diving on something up ahead - just
          out of sight around a bend in the lake.

          93 EXT. LAKESIDE, MOMENTS LATER - DAY 93

          SMITH is the first to see it - a full grown reindeer
          bogged to the shoulders in the soft mud by the lake's
          edge. As they approach the ravens rise in a great
          flapping of wings. The group circle the wild-eyed beast,
          pathetic in it's attempts to pull itself out of the bog,
          faced now with this new and more deadly threat. VALKA
          draws his knife.

          94 EXT. A COVE, LAKESIDE - DAY 94

          TOMASZ already has a fire going when the rest of the
          party appear dragging the carcass of the reindeer on an
          improvised sled made of driftwood. VOSS watches a moment
          as preparations are made to butcher the animal, then he
          turns and hurries back in the direction from which they
          came. JANUSZ watches him. He knows where he's going.

          95 EXT. LAKESIDE/PATHWAY - DAY 95

          VOSS moving fast beside the lake, then onto the track,
          running now, retracing their steps.

          96 EXT. CAMPSITE, LAKE - DUSK 96

          TOMASZ butchers more meat from the reindeer using VALKA's
          knife, while SMITH sets up a wooden rotisserie on the
          fire assisted by ZORAN. JANUSZ and VALKA are part way
          through skinning the beast when they pause on hearing
          footsteps. Around the point comes VOSS, followed by the
          girl. As they approach, an expectant silence.

                         VOSS
          Her name is, Irena.

          97 EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER - NIGHT 97

          They eat in silence, savoring every mouthful. We hear
          the sounds of eating - bones sucked to the marrow;
          fingers licked; bones crunching.

           IRENA is like a half-starved animal, eating with absorbed
           concentration, the others sneaking looks in her direction
           as they savor the fresh killed meat.

          98 EXT. CAMPSITE, LAKESIDE

          JANUSZ has been on the last watch of the night, and as
          dawn breaks he approaches his sleeping companions. He
          stares down at IRENA, sleeping like a child by the fire.
          Slowly the others stir, all moving slowly and quietly,
          not wanting to disturb her sleep.

          99 EXT. LAKESIDE, CAMPSITE - DAY 99

          ZORAN has set himself up as camp barber - trimming hair
          and shaving heads using the razor-blade inserted in the
          end of a stick, and for shaving cream, a chunk of fat
          from the reindeer. JANUSZ has just been shaved and
          trimmed, the last but for VALKA. While the others wash
          themselves and their clothes, ZORAN calls for VALKA, who
          approaches reluctantly and sits on the rock before the
          barber.

                          

                         VALKA
          Why do we do this?

                         ZORAN
          So we don't look like thieves and
          robbers.
          ZORAN approaches him, blade in hand.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Very still, please.
          He tilts VALKA's neck, seemingly the better to shave him.
          In fact, he enjoys teasing VALKA and his movements are 
          slow and ominous, VALKA clearly nervous.

          construction of a bone frame for a backpack. He later

          frame. Still later he collects nearby vines, rolling

          TOMASZ; In between sketching scenes of his friends at
          work he skims fat from the pot filled with boiling bones,
          and lays out strips of meat given to him by VALKA to dry
          in the sun, part of the jerked meat they will carry as a
          long term food supply.
          VALKA; With the 'Wolf' he separates sinews and tendons
          from the beast, to form much needed bindings for their
          journey. He also cuts meat for their jerked supply, or
          to be smoked.

                          
          SMITH; Makes firstly a large bone needle, then later

                          
          makes repairs in his clothes.
          ZORAN; After cleaning his teeth with a twig, hangs his
          suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a
          branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests
          he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting
          the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant
          of the 'bone-bank'. 'Customers' come to him looking for
          bones or teeth for various uses.
          JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he
          stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts
          a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He
          also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat
          and fat.
          IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she
          seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes
          her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and
          whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she
          reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all
          affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a
          young woman when she returns washed, and wearing the

          SMITH and JANUSZ some distance from the campsite
          collecting wood. By the fire ZORAN leads the 'Survivors
          Band'. He has them drumming on logs, tapping sticks,
          harmonizing, amid much laughter. JANUSZ watches IRENA.
          Then he turns to SMITH.

                         JANUSZ
          She's educated. Speaks good
          English. And French.

          That right.

          You don't like her, do you?

          I did speak to him. And the
          others. They agree she comes with
          us.

                         SMITH
          It's decided then?

          You disagree.

                         SMITH
          Apart from food she'll slow us
          down. There's no room for

          Refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from
          the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track
          by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to
          her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH
          she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up
          with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to
          charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years.

          103 EXT. RIVER/LAKE - DAY


                         103
          A river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle. They
          walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow,
          but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with
          JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their
          weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man,
          a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their
          side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim
          for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer
          clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots
          about their necks. IRENA watches.

                         SMITH
          Can you swim?

                         IRENA
          Yes, Mister.

                         SMITH
          You wouldn't lie to me?

                         IRENA
          I'm not lying, Comrade.
          That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy
          by it.

                         SMITH
          And don't call me, 'comrade'.
          With a shout the group plunge into the icy water,
          swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level
          in the other. It's only when they reach the other side
          they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The 
          others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment
          then runs upstream to where the river is frozen.

          They watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and
          bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite
          bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times
          it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over
          a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other
          side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on
          her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is
          worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to 
          follow him into the tree-line.

           They scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional 
           backward glances to see if the hunter is following. 
           There's no sign of him. 

          106 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 106

           Some time later the group, still a little damp, walk by 
          the lake. IRENA walks beside SMITH whose long strides
          force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at
          mosquitoes as they walk.

                         SMITH
          Janusz tells me your family were
          Kulaks?

                         IRENA
          Yes. Just a cow and some pigs.

                         SMITH
          Were your parents arrested with
          you?

          They're dead.
          She swats at a few mosquitos hovering around her face.

          We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.
          When the Russians came they said
          we were 'kulaks', and exploiting
          the peasants. My parents were
          afraid and hid me in the barn.
          The mosquitos are getting worse and SMITH grabs swatches
          of leaves, passing one to IRENA as they walk on, swinging
          away at the annoying insects.

          They were cruel to me. I ran
          away. I had no food. Then I saw
          you.

                         HER TEARS
          They walk in silence a few paces, and she dries
          with the corner of her sleeve.

                         SMITH
          You can't swim can you?
          She looks up at him.

                         IRENA
          What?

                         SMITH
          You've never been in the water in
          your life.
          She laughs coquettishly.

                         IRENA
          But I got across, didn't I?

                         SMITH
          And, you said you lived on a farm
          near Warsaw?
          IRENA puzzled.

                         IRENA
          Yes.

                         SMITH
          The Soviets didn't get that far.
          That was German territory.
          She nervously swats the mosquitos.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          Your parents weren't murdered were
          they? You made it all up.
          pinched,
          She won't look at him, her face looks thin and
          she seems older.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We've all done terrible things to
          survive. But don't ever lie to me
          again. We've had enough of lies.

                         (CONTINUED)

           She sneaks a glance back over her shoulder at the others,
           then up at SMITH. She nods.

          108 EXT. ROAD, OUTSIDE A SMALL TOWN,LAKE BAIKAL - LATE 108 


                          AFTERNOON 
          A fishing village by the lake. Timber houses straggling
          back up into the surrounding hills. From cover, they
          consider the obstacle.

                         JANUSZ
          We'll have to go 'round it.

                         VALKA
          Quicker through it.

                         JANUSZ
          They'll have dogs. Raise the
          alarm. We wouldn't stand a chance

                         VALKA
          We need food again, Pakhan.

                         JANUSZ
          I know we need food, but we're not
          going into that town, risk
          everything.
          SMITH gets up.

                         SMITH
          We're wasting time.
          He strikes off up a slope toward the hills behind the
          town.

          109 EXT.HILLS BEHIND VILLAGE - DUSK 109 


                          
          The group make their way uphill and around the town.

          A110 EXT.TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT A110

          Their P.O.V. down to the few lights of the town and the
          lake glimmering in the moonlight. From the direction of
          the town - the sound of a dog barking in an agitated
          fashion.

          AB110 EXT. HILLS BEHIND VILLAGE, SAME TIME - NIGHT AB110

          SMITH joins JANUSZ. Off his expression:

                         SMITH

                         (TO JANUSZ)
          What is it? What's wrong?

                         JANUSZ
          Where's Valka?

                         SMITH
          He was behind Zoran.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO ZORAN)
          Didn't you watch Valka?

                         ZORAN
          I'm not his keeper.

                         JANUSZ
          Damn him!
          He looks back down to the town. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
            65.

          110 EXT. THE GROUNDS OF A HOUSE, VILLAGE - NIGHT 110

          A dim light through a side window - the glimpse of a
          woman crossing through frame, followed shortly after by
          the weathered face of a fisherman. He's heard something.
          He crosses to the window, peers out into the darkness.
          The moment he turns away the camera moves on around the
          side to the rear of the building, past a rabbit in a
          cage. VALKA's shoulder comes into frame as he edges his
          way toward the back door, passing the sightless skull of
          a dried fish swinging from a cord under the eaves. He
          reaches for the door-handle, opens it, and slips silently
          inside.
          A111 EXT. TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT Alll
           A view along a road to the town. (P.O.V. now on the 
          opposite side of town to that seen earlier.)

           Theabove P.O.V. is that of the group waiting for VALKA.

                          
          Theysit by the roadside looking toward the town. They

                          
          swatat a cloud of mosquitoes.

                         SMITH
          He could turn us in for the
          bounty.

                         JANUSZ
          And risk arrest?

                         SMITH
          He'd bribe his way out of it.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO IRENA)
          Would he do that?

                         IRENA
          He might.

                         ZORAN
          It's an opportunity. We're rid of
          him.

                         TOMASZ
          We don't need his knife. We can
          make one from deer bone.

                         ZORAN
          Come on! Let's go!

                         (CONTTNTTRD )

                         

                         

                         

                         
           66.

                         111

                         111 CONTINUED:
          A movement behind them, they turn as VALKA steps out from
          behind a tree. He stares back at them a crooked grin on
          his face.

                         VALKA
          So.
          SMITH moves swiftly, grabs him by his collar and spins
          him into the tree.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Hey, easy cowboy!

                         SMITH
          Could have got us all killed.

                         VALKA
          You tear my coat

                         SMITH
          Fool!
          He releases him and VALKA staggers back, reaching down to
          a bulging sack. He tips out the contents - various 
          foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle
          of vodka.

                         VALKA
          'Fool' is it?
          It's then they notice blood splashed over his trousers.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          What? Did I kill you ask? Yes.
          A dog.

                         (HE LAUGHS)
          Don't believe me? So don't eat.
          But you will won't you? Because
          you want survival. I know about
          survival! All my life.
          He holds up the bottles of vodka, one half empty

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          And it's my birthday!
          With a wild look in his eyes, he passes a bottle to
          JANUSZ, then flicks the side of his neck with his middle
          finger.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          In Russia that means we drink!

                         

                         

                         

                         
            67.

          112 EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER - NIGHT 112

          TOMASZ tends the rabbit roasting on the fire, while the
          vodka bottle is passed hand to hand. When not drinking,
          the group are swatting at the persistent mosquitoes,
          ZORAN now badly bitten. VALKA doesn't seem bothered by
          the mosquitoes, perhaps tatoos keep them away, anyway
          he's feeling generally pleased with himself and is very
          talkative.

                         VALKA
          You know when they put the
          children of the political
          prisoners in the orphanage, they
          change their names, so later, the
          parents can never find them.

                         ZORAN
          Is that what happened to you?

                         VALKA
          (shakes his head)
          I didn't have parents. But that's
          what happened to her.
          He passes IRENA the bottle. She glares back at him.

                         VALKA (CONT'D)
          Isn't it? You told me that.
          She glances at the puzzled faces of the others, finally
          looking at SMITH. He holds her gaze. Then she takes a
          slug of the vodka.

                         IRENA
          They called me 'Rykov', but I
          remembered our Polish name -
          'Zulinski'. I used to say it
          every night before I went to
          sleep.

                         JANUSZ
          The story you told us

                         IRENA (OVERLAP)
          I thought that story would be more
          sad, and you wouldn't leave me
          behind.
          Again she looks at SMITH. She made a promise to him.

          My parents were Polish communists.

          We lived in the Hotel Luxe with
          lots of foreign communists. But
          they arrested them. In 1937.
          Said they were spies. The police
          put me in the orphanage. And my
          brother. He died. I was ten
          years old.

                         JANUSZ
          And you ran away.
          She nods. VALKA grinning proudly at her.

                         VALKA
          She lived in the streets, like me!
          He breaks into one of his Urki songs. IRENA translates.

                         IRENA
          It's about a mother complaining to
          her son that he's a thief, just
          like his father... it goes on and
          says, 'but if you are strong
           enough to fight 'til death - you
           will conquer fate'.
           She joins VALKA in the chorus.

          113 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 113 

           The mosquitos continue to plaguethem,swirling in clouds 
           about their heads, crawling intoears,eyes and mouths. 
           They have improvised headgear -coats,swatches of 
           leaves, improvised masks. Many are badly bitten, faces 
           swollen, bites infected. SMITH walks beside JANUSZ. 

                          SMITH 
           What can we do? Steal a boat? 

                          JANUSZ 
           No. 

                          SMITH 
           People are going to get ill. 

                          JANUSZ 
           I know. 

                          SMITH 
           After all we've faced, how 
           strange, these tiny insects might 
           defeat us. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
            68A.

          A114 LATER, PLOUGHED FIELD - DAY A114 
           The group collect potatoes in a ploughed field by the 
           lake. ZORAN can no longer take the mosquitoes, and to 
           the astonishment of the others, he runs toward the water, 
           shedding his coat as he goes, eventually diving into the 
           water and submerging himself. 

          114 EXT. LAKESIDE, LATER - DAY 114 

          From a concealed position in the trees they watch as half
          a dozen peasants walk by the lake. ZORAN studies them
          intently.

                         ZORAN

                         (A WHISPER)
          No mosquitos.
          The others unsure of his meaning.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          They have no mosquitos!

                         

                         

                         

                         
            69.

          115 EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS, LAKESIDE - DAY/DUSK 115

          The group have by now a walking routine which they rarely
          vary, always occupying the same positions in extended
          line. JANUSZ as navigator in the lead, SMITH generally
          bringing up the rear. IRENA is the exception - varying
          her place, now with one, now with another. They don't
          talk much to each other as they walk but they do talk
          with her. She has the knack of getting anyone to talk.
          No doubt a skill learnt in her life on the streets.

          116 EXT. FOREST NEAR THE ROAD - DAY 116

           A small fire burns as TOMASZ cooks a fish stolen by 
           VALKA. The smoke from the fire is not enough to 
          alleviate the mosquito problem and the group swat in
          miserable silence. Suddenly SMITH throws dirt on the
          fire, suffocating it with his jacket. He points to the
          road.

          117 EXT. ROAD - DAY 117

          From their point of view a fisherman in his fifties, a 
          basket in a sling on his back, walks abreast of them on 
          the track.

          118 EXT. FOREST - DAY 118

          As he passes, ZORAN speaks in a whisper to JANUSZ.

                         ZORAN
          There it is! Again!
          JANUSZ mystified.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Look at him.
          JANUSZ stares again at the man.

          No mosquitos!
          ZORAN is up and off before anyone can stop him. They
          watch in appalled silence as he approaches and speaks to
          the man, who regards this stranger appearing from the
          forest with some suspicion. ZORAN does a kind of crazy
          dance, talking all the while.

          Soon the man is laughing, and putting down his bag and
          gun he takes something from around his neck and places it
          on ZORAN's neck. A few more words, and more laughter,
          then with a handshake ZORAN heads back into the forest,
          the man continuing on his way. ZORAN rejoins them,
          holding up the gift from the old man - strands of
          intertwined bark.

          That I was an escaped convict who
          was being plagued by mosquitos.

          voice drifts back.

          toward the trees where the others are approaching down a
          wooded hillside. He hurries toward them, urging them to
          take cover in the bracken beside the track. SMITH points

           Close on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the 
           carriages stopped in front of them. They are cattle- 
           cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From 
           the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars.
           From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, 
           female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized 
           faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy.
           Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and
           from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and
           urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly 
           moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop
           to the tracks from the barred windows.
           After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the 
           woods on the other side, all but VOSS. He is picking up

          some scrawled on the back of photographs. They are

          inform relatives of what happened to them - some have

          Around a bend, a decorative archway over the road, a town
          visible a few miles further on. They stop in their
          tracks. On one side of the timber structure a portrait
          of Josef Stalin. On the other the local Mongolian
          leader, a red star on his military cap. In the centre,
          the hammer and sickle over a painting of a brown hand
          shaking a white one. Small flags of both nations flap
          ominously.
          CLOSE on the stunned faces of the fugitives.

                         VOSS
          It's here too.

                         SMITH
          This changes everything.
          IRENA looks at the grassy plains all about them.

                         IRENA
          Nowhere to hide.

          A136 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE, LATER - DAY A136 

           The group walk toward a distant line of hills, feeling 
           very exposed to any watching eyes. 

                          ZORAN 
           How far is China? 

                          JANUSZ 
           Five, six hundred kilometers. 
           ZORAN groans. 

                          IRENA 
           Is China free? 

                          SMITH 
           There's a war on with the 
           Japanese, I know that much. 

                         VOSS
          After China is Tibet. Religious
          people. Buddhists.

                         JANUSZ
          But isn't Tibet closed to
          foreigners? I remember reading
          that.

                         VOSS
          Their religion would compel them
          to shelter us. We could go to
          Lhasa, the capital.

                         ZORAN
          We break out of one 'closed
          country' and now we plan to break
          into another? I like 'open'
          countries.
          TOMASZ and JANUSZ exchange a few excited words in Polish.
          IRENA translates.

                         IRENA
          They say we could go beyond Tibet.
          Over the mountains. To India.

                         ZORAN
          What mountains?

                         SMITH
          (shakes his head)
          The Himalayas.

                         TOMASZ
          We could join the British Army.
          First fight Nazis then Russians!

                         ZORAN
          Go over the Himalayas? How? On a
          magic carpet?
          A silence as they contemplate the massive distances
          stretching ahead of them.

          AB136 EXT. ABANDONED STONE BUILDING, MONGOLIA - DAWN AB136 

          In the middle of an empty plain a small circular stone
          ruin.

                          

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          136 INT. RUIN - DAWN 136

          Sleeping figures. A gentle tip-tapping sound. VOSS
          opens his eyes. Staring back at him from the doorway,
          half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily,
          takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS
          drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep
          retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase
          is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a
          knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm.

                         JANUSZ
          No! Andrejs, no!
          VOSS tries to free his arm.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          Don't kill it!

                         TOMASZ
          Why not? We're hungry!

                         JANUSZ
          You want the locals after us too?
          They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of
          pent up frustration. VOSS picks up the sheep and carries
          it inside the ruin.

          137 INT. RUIN, LATER - DAY 137

          Milk squirting into their aluminium bowl as VOSS expertly
          milks the ewe, IRENA and ZORAN holding it steady.

          138 EXT. STEPPE - DAY 138

          The sun is blazing as they cross through a sea of grass,
          hills rising in the distance like islands.
          TOMASZ and ZORAN play a long distance walker's game -
          each in turn kicking a rock out ahead, continually
          passing it from one to the other.
          JANUSZ and SMITH look to the hills surrounding them as
          they walk.

                         JANUSZ
          You feel it?

                         SMITH
          Yes.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Feel what?

                         JANUSZ
          We're being watched.
          IRENA uneasy, squints in the direction of the hills. And
          you can feel it. Like a John Ford western there's a
          sense of being in Indian territory, of their every move
          watched by unseen eyes.

          A139 EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY A139

           A distant view of a temple complex at the base of low 
          hills. 

          AB139 EXT. STEPPE - DAY AB139 

           The above has been pointed out by VOSS to the group, and 
           they decide to make their way to the temple, in the hope 
           of getting food. 

          139 EXT. ABANDONED TEMPLE COMPLEX, STEPPES - DAY 139 

          Within a walled compound they wander between a series of
          recently abandoned Buddhist temples and out-buildings.
          By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may
          have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence -
          doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies
          smashed in a courtyard. JANUSZ points to a line of
          bullet impacts, stitched across a wall.

          140 INT. TEMPLE - DAY 140

          There are bloodstains on the floor, and the wind howling
          about the building makes a haunting accompaniment. IRENA
          and VOSS are alone inside.

                         IRENA
          What happened here?

                         VOSS
          The same as happened in Russia.
          Churches closed, priests shot or
          taken to camps, religion banned.
          They came to my church, in Latvia.
          Destroyed everything, declared it
          a 'museum'. Later that night,
          there was a lone guard. A boy.

          I strangled him until his eyes
          popped right out of his head.
          Valka knew somehow. Knew I'd
          killed in cold blood.
          He bows his head. IRENA looks up at him, and they stand
          together in silence, but for the moaning wind.

          141 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAY 141

          As they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts
          when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian
          horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle
          them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear
          the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age
          from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy.
          The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH,
          figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader.
          The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in
          Russian, a rough guttural accent.

          [THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE IS IN RUSSIAN.]

                         OLD MAN
          Russki?
          A glance between SMITH and JANUSZ. Much may hang on his
          answer.

                         SMITH
          No. American.
          The OLD MAN maybe doesn't get the 'American' part, but he
          gets that they are not Russian. He seems pleased about
          that.

                         OLD MAN
          Lhasa?
          SMITH nods.

                         SMITH
          Lhasa. Yes. Tibet.
          JANUSZ points South.

                         OLD MAN
          Pilgrim?

                         SMITH
          Yes.

                         OLD MAN
          No horses?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         SMITH
          We are too poor to have horses.
          The OLD MAN points at IRENA.

                         OLD MAN
          Wife?
          SMITH looks at IRENA.

                         SMITH
          Daughter.
          IRENA moves closer to him. SMITH puts a protective arm
          about her shoulder. The OLD MAN considers the situation
          for a moment longer before abruptly turning, and followed
          by his band, galloping off toward the distant hills.
          Looks between the group, not exactly of relief, as
          there's a feeling it may not be the last they see of the
          riders. IRENA looks up at SMITH, smiles at him.
          Something about him calling her his daughter has touched
          some hidden place. SMITH, a little embarrassed, smiles
          back.

          142 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE, MONGOLIA - DAY 142

          While SMITH fishes in the river, others tend to their
          battered feet. VOSS passes around deer fat in his
          improvised deer skull container. This they rub over raw
          patches, and between their toes where deep cracks have
          developed. JANUSZ repairs their footwear, while TOMASZ
          sits by the fire sketching IRENA. ZORAN, the camp
          barber, trims hairs and beards

          143 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 143

          TOMASZ is smoking fish over the fire as the group stir.
          He gives ZORAN a kick.

                         ZORAN
          What did you do that for? I was
          in the middle of this beautiful
          dream - just about to eat some
          salt, I could already taste it. I
          want to go back to that dream.

          144 EXT. STEPPES, MONGOLIA, LATER - DAY 144

          The figures seen walking away in the distance. Floating
          back the voice of TOMASZ giving a recipe of a favorite
          Polish dish to ZORAN.

                         ( CONTTNTTFT) )

          Then add two sprigs of rosemary
          and a pinch of nutmeg.

                         ZORAN
          Nutmeg? What about the salt?

                         TOMASZ
          We'll get to that. Now, add the
          oil and leave it to marinate,
          while you prepare the chicken.
          That's where the salt comes in...

                         ZORAN
          Good.

                         TOMASZ
          Rub it into the skin of the
          chicken with a little of the
          paprika.

                         Z ORAN
          Double the salt.

                         TOMASZ
          I can't just double the salt!
          It'll be too salty.

                         ZORAN
          I don't care, just do it.

                         TOMASZ
          I'm not going to ruin it.

          145 EXT. A CHANGING LANDSCAPE, MONGOLIA - DAY 145

           A primaeval and austerely beautiful landscape stretches 
          before them. Tufty knolls of dry grass are the only
          detail that break up the flat immensity.

          146 RIDGE-TOP - DAY 146
          Up ahead of them on the edge of a ridge a lone Mongolian
          horseman watches them approach. He's the young boy from
          the group of horseman who originally approached them.
          They pause before him. He looks at them a moment then
          tosses a goatskin bag at their feet before galloping off
          in the direction from which they came. VOSS picks up the
          skin bag, gives it a shake. Water.
          They continue on to the edge of the ridge and a view of a 
          vast desert plain is revealed.

          They look back to the disappearing horseman before
          scrambling down the rocky slope.

          A147 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY A147

          The group crossing into the heart of the Gobi.

          147 EXT. GOBI DESERT, LATER - DAY 147

          VOSS is the first to see it - a vast glittering lake.
          They hurry toward it.

          148 LATER, 148
          The lake leads them on, but appears no closer.

          149 LATER STILL, 149
          JANUSZ has taken a reading of the sun, using his stick
          method. He points out their direction - it is away from
          the beckoning lake.

                         VOSS
          Janusz!
          JANUSZ hesitates, looks at VOSS who holds up their water-
          bag.

          VOSS (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
          We should go to the lake. Water
          is getting low.

                         JANUSZ
          What lake? It's a mirage.
          He plods on, away from the shimmering vision. There's
          little the others can do but trust JANUSZ, and slowly
          they follow.

          150 EXT. THE GOBI - MIDDAY/DUSK 150

          The sun is directly above, the land shimmering with heat
          The group have stuck their sticks in the ground and
          draped their jackets over them, making a sunshade they
          SHELTER under.

          151 LATER, 151
          The sun has dropped, casting shadows. JANUSZ rises from
          the shelter and calls for the others to continue.

          152 EXT. THE GOBI - ANOTHER DAY 152

          The figures, tiny in the surrounding desert, walk on,
          JANUSZ in the lead needing to constantly slow down to
          allow the others to catch up.

          A153 EXT. THE GOBI - SAME DAY A153

          The group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up
          ahead. Nothing on the horizon. Then they are hit by a
          fierce wind, as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand.
          They drop to the ground instinctively, and huddled
          together throw blankets around their shoulders and over
          their heads, as they are engulfed in the choking sand.
          LATER, they emerge from their own 'dune', and shaking 
          themselves down they resume their journey southward. 

          153 EXT. THE GOBI - NIGHT 153

          The temperature has dropped to freezing and they huddle
          by a fire, picking sand out of their small ration of
          food.

                         ZORAN
          I'm too tired to sleep.

                         TOMASZ
          Why not keep walking?

                         ZORAN
          I'm for that, if we can wake
          Andrejs.
          They look to where VOSS sleeps.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          He can sleep anywhere, any time.
          How does he do it?

                         SMITH

                         (TO JANUSZ)
          Can you plot your way by the
          stars?

                         JANUSZ
          (Nods.)
          Yes, but haven't you noticed?
          He points upward to the low clouds obscuring the stars.

                         SMITH
          What about water?

                         JANUSZ
          What about it?

                         F CNNTTNTTFT)1

                         153 CONTINUED: 153

                         SMITH
          I don't see any. I'm trying to
          remember my school geography but I
          seem to recall the Gobi Desert
          somewhere in Southern Mongolia.
          JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground.
          It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch
          as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their
          cooking pot in the base.

                         JANUSZ
          We may pick up a little morning
          dew.
          Glad of something practical to do they all set about
          digging and lining holes with anything to hand.

          154 EXT. THE GOBI - DAWN 154

          As they wake, they harvest the precious droplets of water
          caught overnight, trickling the contents into their pot,
          barely a quarter cupful.

          155 EXT. GOBI - DAY 155

          No-one has slept much and they walk like zombies, strung
          out in a line, no-one speaking, all just dully
          concentrating on placing one foot after the other. ZORAN
          notices VOSS, walking behind him is actually asleep. He
          has swung his backpack onto his chest and with his head
          resting on it he is actually sleep-walking. ZORAN tests
          his theory by walking away from the group, in a small
          circle. VOSS follows, guided by the sound of ZORAN's
          footsteps. He wakes him, VOSS looking around with a
          start.

                         ZORAN
          You were asleep!

                         VOSS
          No I wasn't.

                         ZORAN
          You were following the sound of my
          footsteps - sleep-walking.
          The others have stopped. ZORAN takes the backpack from
          VOSS, and places it on the exhausted IRENA.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Just follow the sound of my
          footsteps.
          She nods, not fully understanding.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          Put all else out of your mind, and
          sleep. I'll wake you in Calcutta.
          She smiles, nods, already half asleep.

          156 EXT. GOBI, LATER - DAY 156

          ZORAN looks over his shoulder, smiles proudly as he sees
          IRENA is sleep-walking, trusting to the steady sound of
          his footsteps.

          157 EXT. GOBI MID-DAY 157

          The group rest under the meagre shade provided by their
          coats. SMITH walks away from them, and crests a slight
          rise. From here he has a clear view to the horizon. Off
          in the distance a dark patch against the light sand.
          Through the dancing mid-day light he sees shapes. Trees?
          He staggers back to the group.

                         SMITH
          Janusz?
          JANUSZ follows him to the rise. SMITH points to his
          discovery. JANUSZ squints against the light.

                         JANUSZ
          It's another mirage.
          SMITH shakes his head 'no'.

                         SMITH
          We have no more water. I see
          trees. Where there's trees
          there's water.

                         JANUSZ
          It's East. We must head South.
          The others have joined them, staring toward the distant
          shape.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         157 CONTINUED: 157

                         SMITH
          I've never doubted you, Janusz.
          Not once. But we must give it a
          try.

                         JANUSZ
          No. We must keep going South!
          You'll kill us all!

                         SMITH
          Damn it, we're already dying.
          JANUSZ goes to move on, SMITH grabs his shirt sleeve, a
          short pathetic struggle sees them fall to their knees,
          VOSS and TOMASZ move to separate them. SMITH is the
          first to stand, brushing sand and dirt from his clothes.
          He turns to the others.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You have a choice.
          He looks at IRENA, then turns and goes back for his staff
          and jacket. The others watch as he turns East toward his
          discovery.

                         JANUSZ
          It's a mirage. Just a mirage.
          SMITH keeps walking away - a strange echo of the incident
          in Siberia when he walked away from the guards. Perhaps
          it is this memory that causes the others to turn
          silently, and collecting their few possessions, to follow
          him. JANUSZ watches a while, then slowly follows.

          158 EXT. THE GOBI - DAY 158

          Close on SMITH as he squints against the glare. His
          point of view:

          OASIS OR MIRAGE? THE DISTANT OUTLINE OF TREES SEEMS TO

          DISAPPEAR IN THE SHIMMERING WAVES OF LIQUID HEAT.

          159 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 159
          Close on TOMASZ as he stares ahead of him. His point of

                         VIEW:

          CLOSER NOW, BUT STILL IT WEAVES, APPEARING AND

          REAPPEARING IN THE HEAT-SHIMMERS.

          160 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 160
          Close on ZORAN. His point of view:

          CLOSER AGAIN. A BIRD RISES INTO THE SKY FROM THE NOW

          MORE SOLID TREES.
          Back on ZORAN.

                         ZORAN
          Mirages don't have birds!
          Wider, and they're running, running with the last of
          their precious energy.

          161 EXT. WELL - DAY 161

          A clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well
          - a low square of ancient stones. They sprawl by the
          well, SMITH reaching down inside with their bowl to bring
          up a scoop of crystal clear water. It's passed around
          rapidly.

                         SMITH
          Just a little. Don't fill
          yourselves.
          More scoops follow in quick succession, enough to splash
          hands and faces.
          VOSS calls from a few yards away.

                         VOSS
          Fire. Coals are still warm.
          SMITH and JANUSZ join him, examining the ground about the
          fire.

                         SMITH
          Lots of tracks. Nomads?

                         VOSS
          Maybe others will come?

                         TOMASZ
          Over here! The remains of a meal!
          There's still meat on the bones!
          He points to the cooked remains of some animal. Using
          VOSS's deer-bone knife he scrapes meat from the bones,
          others just attacking any bone they find.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         JANUSZ
          Don't eat it all!
          He manages to save at least half of the meat, wrapping it
          in a cloth, and putting it in VOSS's backpack.

          162 EXT. WELL, LATER - DAY 162

          They lie stretched out under the shade of the trees
          dozing, and every now and then going back to the well to
          drink or just to lay their hands in the cool water.

          163 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 163

          IRENA sleeps while the men discuss their situation in
          hushed tones.

                         TOMASZ
          At least we have water here.

                         JANUSZ
          But no food.

                         VOSS
          Other nomads will come. Water
          their flocks.

                         JANUSZ
          When? Next week? Next month?

                         ZORAN
          We could wait a few days, at
          least.

                         JANUSZ
          Without food, we'll only get
          weaker. Maybe too weak to travel.

                         TOMASZ
          These last days - I don't know
          that I could go through that
          again.

                         VOSS
          (looks at the water)
          It was a miracle finding this.
          Can we count on another?

                         TOMASZ
          I say we stay.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         163 CONTINUED: 163
          They look to SMITH. He looks up to find them watching
          him.

                         SMITH
          What are you looking at me for?
          Ask Janusz. He's already made up
          his mind for us, haven't you,
          Janusz?
          JANUSZ says nothing.

          164 EXT.WELL - DAWN 164

           They all take a last drink from the well, then pour water
           over their faces and clothes. VOSS fills the skin water-
           bag, then ZORAN fills their cooking bowl to the brim.
          Steamis rising from their damp clothing when they set
          off. ZORAN walking on tip-toe, anxiousnot to spill a
          dropfrom the bowl in his outstretchedhand.

          165 EXT.GOBI DESERT - DAY 165

           Close on TOMASZ as he looks back over his shoulder to

                         SEE:

           THE WELL, STILL NOT MORE THAN 500 YARDS BEHIND.

          166 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 166
          Close on ZORAN as he too turns for a last look at:

          THE WELL, NOW UP TO HALF A MILE BEHIND AND LOOKING LESS

          REAL IN THE SHIMMERING HEAT.

          167 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 167
          Close on VOSS, he shades his eyes to see:

          THE WELL IS BELOW THE HORIZON NOW, AND ALL THAT CAN BE

          SEEN IS THE ENDLESS FLATNESS, THE SAME EMPTINESS THAT

          STRETCHES OUT BEFORE THEM.

          168 EXT. GOBI, DESERT - TIMELAPSE - DAY 168 

          They walk in a desert void. There are no features, no
          distant hills, no growth of any kind. It is an
          emptiness, the only sound that of their footsteps and
          their labored breathing.

                         168 CONTINUED: 168
          All the while their water supply is dwindling - water
          from ZORAN's bowl long gone, the goat-skin water-bag no
          longer sloshes, but has to be squeezed to get out even a
          mouthful.

          169 EXT. GOBI - DUSK 169

          JANUSZ hands out small portions of the scavenged meat
          from the waterhole.
          All of them are subject to cramps, the result of the lack
          of water, and from time to time they are seen reacting to
          a sudden bolt of pain, attempting to stretch against it,
          or massage the limb out of its paralysis.

          170 LATER, SAME CAMPSITE - NIGHT 170 
          SMITH and JANUSZ collect more dried camel dung for the
          fire. SMITH looks to where the others sit.

                         SMITH
          We're in trouble.

                         JANUSZ
          I know that, but they mustn't.

                         SMITH
          They know.

                         JANUSZ
          You can survive a month or more
          without food, but water?

                         SMITH
          Days?

                         JANUSZ
          Maybe two days, maybe less in this
          heat.

                         SMITH
          What about what we're getting from
          condensation?

                         JANUSZ
          It's the only thing keeping us
          alive. But for how long?

                         SMITH
          Can you get us back to the
          waterhole?

                         (CONTINUED)

          172 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 172 

          As they walk VOSS picks up a pebble, holds it up to show
          ZORAN who walks behind him.

                         VOSS
          When we worked the fields, during
          the hot summers, we used to suck
          on small stones like these. Don't
          know why but it made us feel less
          thirsty.
          ZORANpicks up a pebble.

                         ZORAN
          We've eaten just about everything
          else.

                         VOSS
          You don't eat it, just suck on it.
          At this moment IRENA falls again, her knees buckling and
          her face pitching into the sand in almost one movement.
          They turn her over again, wiping the sand from her nose
          and mouth. SMITH makes a shelter over her with their
          sticks and jackets. She lies with her eyes closed, her
          breathing coming in harsh gasps. Both legs are now
          swollen to the knees. He touches the swelling and the 
          marks his fingers make remain for some seconds.

          Sunstroke?
          IRENA wakes.

                         IRENA
          I'm becoming a nuisance.
          She looks down at her legs.

                         JANUSZ
          Do they hurt you?

                         IRENA
          No, not at all. They must be
          swelling because I've walked so
          far. Don't you think, Mister?
          SMITH nods reassuringly then quickly turns away, a look 
          of deep anguish passing across his face. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          173 EXT. GOBI - NIGHT 173

          The others keep watch over her as she sleeps. SMITH
          passes around a splash of water in the cup. They all
          refuse it.

                         ZORAN
          Save it for Irena. We've got our
          pebbles.
          And he pops one in his mouth, makes out it's delicious
          and soothing.
          In the now familiar ritual they scoop out holes in the
          sand, lining them with their jackets, hopeful of
          collecting a little moisture overnight.

          174 EXT. GOBI - DAWN 174

          They walk on, ZORAN carefully carrying the partly filled
          bowl of water. IRENA seems refreshed, but JANUSZ and
          SMITH walk beside her, watching her every step.

                         IRENA
          I can walk alright if I can lean a
          little on you.
          They each lightly lay a hand on her elbow.

          175 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 175 

          IRENA starts to fall forward, they steady her, and she
          walks on for a bit before slumping forward, and falling
          to her knees. SMITH too falls with exhaustion. VOSS
          hurries back to them.

                         JANUSZ
          Can you go on?

                         IRENA
          I think so. But what about Mr.
          Smith?
          SMITH struggling for breath is back on his feet, waving
          them on. VOSS and JANUSZ each put an arm about her and
          half-carrying, half-dragging her, they set off again but
          it's no use, she's lost all her strength.

                         VOSS
          I'm going to carry her.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

          178 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY 178

          A lizard, in close up, listens to an approaching sound.
          As the volume builds he runs for his life. A beetle too,
          has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a
          battered moccasin looms large in frame. We follow the
          foot a few staggering steps, then a blur, as a body falls
          through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath
          coming in short gasps.

          179 EXT. WIDER, GOBI DESERT - DAY 179 

          The five figures, small in frame, TOMASZ the last in
          line, down on his knees. He raises a hand, hasn't the
          strength to call out. Then one of the figures sees him,
          calls to the others.
          CLOSE on TOMASZ.
          He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the
          tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As
          JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers
          to his feet. JANUSZ steadies him, and taking his arm
          they continue.

          180 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 180

          As they walk the landscape changes from the endless
          scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the
          terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on
          the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the
          wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie
           singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive 
           dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up, 
           staring in horror - 

                          TOMASZ'S HALLUCINATION: 
           The dune is moving, rising up, higher and higher, like a 
           massive sand wave.
           Back on TOMASZ. He collapses, unconscious. 

          181 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - TWILIGHT 181 

           An eerie, ghostly twilight, the group all sitting 
           together in a rough circle around TOMASZ. He seems to 
          revive as he passes around sketches he's made during
          their imprisonment and escape.

                         181 CONTINUED: 181
          It's an almost cheerful scene, like a traveller showing
          happy snaps taken on holiday.

                         VOSS
          I like this one. When did you do
          that?
          He holds up a sketch of KAZIK, showing him examining one 
          of his battered shoes.

                         TOMASZ
          On the train. Poor Kazik, always 
          the trouble with his feet. 
          ZORAN holds up a drawing of himself.

                         ZORAN
          Who's this?

                         TOMASZ
          You.
          ZORAN looks at it again genuinely shocked.

                         ZORAN
          My father maybe, but is that
          how I look now?
          A chuckle from the others.
          SMITH stares at a sketch of IRENA.

                         SMITH
          You caught her smile. 
          SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back
          down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He
          knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn
          has given strength to his friends, and between them all
          is a feeling of love and a kind of peace.

          182 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - DAWN 182 

          They've tied his pencil to a length of hide, and hung it
          from the top of the cross over his grave. A faint breath
          of morning breeze sets it swinging like a pendulum, the
          others long gone.

          183 EXT. DUNES - DAY 183

          As they stagger on JANUSZ has moved well out in front,
          when he stumbles and falls. Then he sees it, just out
          ahead, and he begins crawling toward it.

          JANUSZ'S MIRAGE - DAY:
          It's the hedge and gate from his vision. Behind the
          hedge the hint of a roof. Through the gate can be seen
          the path to the front door.

          184 EXT. DUNES - DAY 184

          JANUSZ crawling faster now, when ZORAN appears beside
          him.

                         JANUSZ
          Do you see it?

                         ZORAN
          Come on, Jan.

                         JANUSZ
          But do you see it?

                         ZORAN
          No.
          He helps him to his feet and they continue on.

          185 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 185

          In the glare of the noon-day sun they shelter under
          their coats propped on their walking staffs. No-one
          speaks.

          186 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 186

          SMITH and JANUSZ support each other as they stagger on.
          SMITH's eyes are on the ground, following the dancing
          shadows before him. JANUSZ nudges him, points - above
          them two magnificent eagles, the source of the shadows.

                         JANUSZ
          Eagles live in mountains.
          SMITH looks at the featureless landscape ahead.

                         SMITH
          They also fly long distances.

          187 EXT. LANDSCAPE, MONGOLIA - DAY 187

          The dunes are more intermittent here, the ground more
          stony and undulating.

          VOSS hears it first, and with his remaining strength
          moves out of the circle of firelight into the desert. He
          pauses, listens again.
          A scraping sound. Then he sees them coming out of the
          gloom - JANUSZ dragging an unconscious SMITH by his
          shoulders. VOSS hurries to them. A look from JANUSZ -
          'water'? VOSS shakes his head, 'No'.

          190 EXT. CAMPSITE - SAME - DAWN 190

          A black snake, thick as your wrist, slides over ZORAN'S
          leg. He stares, too close to death to feel fear. He's
          not even entirely sure it's real. He watches its
          progress as it slithers up the rocky hillside. Then he
          gets it, and he's up, running on pure adrenaline,
          following after the snake, leaving his sleeping
          companions by the fire.

          191 EXT. HILLSIDE - BRIEF MONTAGE - DAY 191

          ZORAN tracking the snake. He mutters to himself in a
          kind of delirium. He is crawling after the snake,
          scraping skin from knees and elbows. The snake disappears
          down into a rocky defile, followed by ZORAN.

          192 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY 192

          SMITH in a death-like sleep. A distance away VOSS and
          JANUSZ stand, staring upward at the waving figure some
          fifty metres up the hill. A native? Black mud obscures
          his face. It's ZORAN. He waves, dances about, then in a
          cracked voice, a single word drifts down to them.

                         ZORAN
          Water!

          193 EXT. VALLEY FLOOR - DAY 193

          ZORAN, JANUSZ, VOSS - lie flat out like lizards, their
          faces in damp, black mud. Sucking sounds. They slurp at
          small pools of water, split lips, puffed and bleeding.
          At first, just to swallow is painful, but it is life.
          After each mouthful there is a moment they must wait as
          the seepage re-fills the little hollows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          194 EXT. MUD-POOLS - LATER - DAY 194

          They've carried SMITH to the water and JANUSZ supports
          him in a sitting position while VOSS and ZORAN, in turn,
          soak their shirts in the mud, dripping the life-giving
          liquid into SMITH'S mouth. He coughs, splutters, as he
          sucks at the moisture.

          195 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE VALLEY - DAY 195

          A black snake protruding about a foot out of a hole in
          the sandy soil. ZORAN points, and is joined by JANUSZ
          and VOSS. JANUSZ holds his hand up for them to go very
          still. He speaks in a whisper.

                         JANUSZ
          Knife .
          VOSS passes him the deer-bone knife. With it, he splits
          the end of his staff, to make a fork out of the end.

                         Z ORAN
          What if it's poisonous?

                         JANUSZ
          You can still eat it. Just cut
          off its head.
          He passes the knife to VOSS, then creeps toward the
          creature, and striking quickly he attempts to trap the
          snake in the fork. Too slow. The snake disappears into
          its hole.

          196 EXT. VALLEY - LATER - DAY 196

          Like snake-fishermen, they sit waiting bythe snake-hole
          - ZORAN too, has a snake-catching stick. Then they see a
          second snake, slithering across the rocks. At a signal
          they strike, ZORAN deftly trapping the snake's head in
          the cleft stick.

          Chunksofwhitish snake meat are cooking on a thin flat
          stoneovera fire of twigs and grass. The men grab
          piecesofthe snake and eat, nodding approval.

                         JANUSZ

          JANUSZ helps SMITH sit up, feeding him a small piece of
          meat. SMITH waves him away, sinking back to the ground
          too tired to eat.

                         VOSS
          Kind of like chicken.

                         ZORAN
          Yeah, a long black poisonous
          chicken with no legs.

                         JANUSZ
          You know Valka talked of eating
          each other? In Siberia?

                         ZORAN
          He did? Would you have eaten me?

                         JANUSZ
          Probably.

                         ZORAN
          I would never have eaten you - too
          stringy and bitter, I'd rather eat
          snake.
          VOSS nearly chokes on something, reaches into his mouth,
          pulls out a tooth.

                         JANUSZ

          The fire burns low, VOSS and ZORAN sleep. SMITH wakes
          from time to time and JANUSZ forces him to eat and drink.
          SMITH is deathly pale, his life ebbing away. He speaks
          in short, croaky stabs, every breath an effort.

                         SMITH
          It can kill you, remember?
          JANUSZ puzzled.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          'Kindness'.
          JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives
          him away.

          How long can you survive on snakes
          and mud? You should leave me, but
          you can't can you? You're a fool.
          I'd leave you.
          He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and
          suffering etched in sharp lines.

                         JANUSZ
          Mister?

          I mightn't know youur first name,
          but I know your son's name.
          SMITH stares at him.

                         SMITH
          Irena told you.
          JANUSZ nods.

                         JANUSZ
          Can I say his name?
          Nothing from SMITH.

                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)
          'David'.

                         SMITH
          Saying his name on't bring him
          back.
          He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ,
          an ironic smile on his lips.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          You trying to give me the will to
          live? That it? Stop me giving
          up?

          Are you giving up?

                         SMITH
          In the camps, some saw death as
          'freedom'.

                         JANUSZ
          So why didn't you kill yourself?

                         SMITH
          Survival was a kind of protest.
          JANUSZ makes him take a little water.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          Now being alive is my punishment.

                         JANUSZ
          Punishment for what?

                         SMITH
          I brought David to Russia didn't

          I?

                         JANUSZ
          And no-one can forgive you? And
          you can't forgive yourself?

                         SMITH
          Be easier if I had religion, or a
          home to go back to, like you.

                         JANUSZ
          For us, the old life is gone.
          They sit in silence for a while.

                         SMITH
          Irena told me they tortured your
          wife and she informed on you.

                         JANUSZ
          Yes.

                         SMITH
          They did that to my boy.

                         JANUSZ

                         (NODS)
          My wife was released, that much I
          know. She lived, but like you she
          won't be able to forgive herself.
          Only I can do that.
          He leans closer to SMITH, speaks just above a whisper,
           his voice intense, his eyes burning.

                          JANUSZ (CONT'D)
           She'll torture herself for what
           she did. Just like you. That's
           why I have to get back!

          This last, has impressed SMITH, and despite his death-
          wish a flicker of life surges through his bones.

          200 EXT. CAMPSITE, MUD-FLAT - DAWN 200

          Next morning, and the figures of the four men are seen in
          wide-shot sleeping by the embers of their fire. One
          figure gets up, picks up his staff, and begins to walk
          slowly South, toward the distant mountains. It's SMITH.
          The others stir, their attention caught by the sight of
          SMITH staggering onward. JANUSZ knows what the effort to
          walk is costing him, and he knows this is SMITH's gift to
          him. They hurriedly pack up, VOSS cramming the back-pack
          with roasted snake-meat, ZORAN collecting a last bowl of
          water, which he pours carefully into their goatskin water-
          bag.

          201 EXT. DESERT - DAY 201

          JANUSZ catches up with SMITH, giving him his arm in
          support, and together they slowly continue their journey
          Southward.

          202 EXT. CHANGING TERRAIN - DAY 202

          They leave the desert behind as they climb gently rising
          ground.

          203 RIVER, MONGOLIA - DAY 203
          The survivors each seen alone as they experience the life-
          giving water: one simply lets water run though his
          fingers; another submerges himself entirely; one drinks,
          savoring every mouthful as if it were the finest vintage
          wine. SMITH fishes. Beside him several of his catch
          gleam silver in the light.

                         204 - OMIT 

          205 EXT. HILLSIDE - DUSK/NIGHT 205

           Walking abreast they head toward a pass between two 
           massive mountains - in the distance gleaming snow-capped 
           peaks rise even higher.

          206 EXT. CAMPSITE, MOUNTAINS - DAWN 206 

          They sleep, huddled together amongst the stony rubble.
          It is snowing. VOSS is the first to rise. He looks
          about him in disbelief, shakes the others awake,
          pointing. Just beyond where they've slept a high wall
          towers above them. In this extreme Western section it's
          in poor shape - not built of stone, but of ancient mud
          bricks, tumbled down in many places, but to the East the
          outline is distinct as it straggles over ridges to the
          horizon - the Great Wall of China.

          207 EXT. THE GREAT WALL, CHINA - DAY 207

           They enter through a keyhole-like opening formed by
           collapsed masonry, now dressed in their cold weather
          clothing.

          208 EXT. SKY - DAY 208

          From high above a series of aerial shots take us over a
          massive snow covered mountain range. 

          209 EXT. SNOWY LANDSCAPE, TIBET - DAY 209

          The men climb steadily up snow-covered hills, pausing at
          a cairn of stones covered with tiny flags.

                         SMITH
          Tibetan?
          They move on with renewed energy.

          210 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, TIBET - DAY 210

          CLOSE on the deeply lined face of a SHEPHERD. He wears
          Tibetan costume and squints his eyes as he stares into
          the distance.
          From his P.O.V., four distant figures walking across the
          snowy plain toward him. The sound of dogs barking.

          211 EXT. A RIDGE NEAR THE SHEPHERD'S HUT - DUSK 211

          Far below in a valley lies the legendary Lhasa - the
          stepped palace and surrounding town burnished by the last
          of the golden light. A sprinkling of lights come on as
          the shadows lengthen.

          Above and beyond, like a massive wall, rise the snow-
          capped peaks of the Himalayas. This has been theview
          stretching out before the four fugitives andtheirtour-
          guide, the old shepherd. As if pointing outthechoice
          confronting them, he labels each of these spectacular
          features.

                         SHEPHERD

                         (POINTING DOWN)
          Lhasa LHA-SA!
          Then, indicating 'over' the mountains -

                          SHEPHERD (CONT'D)

          IN-DI-A!
          In dumb-show, he mines that the mountains would be very
          cold.

          212 EXT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 212

          Three horses arrive at the door of the lonely hut and its
          associated outbuildings. THE SHEPHERD dismounts and with
          much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who
          follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They
          stoop as they enter - a glimpse inside to where the four
          survivors sit at a table, surrounded by bowls and plates
           of food. 

          213 INT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 213

          The LAMA and the OFFICIAL sit opposite the group. Tea is
          served. The official speaks English with difficulty, and
          as in Mongolia, he addresses the elder of the group - MR.

          SMITH.

                         OFFICIAL
          India? Yes. There is the track
          to Sikkim, over the mountains.
          Many people go there.

                         SMITH
          And food?

                         OFFICIAL
          Small villages there. They give
          food. Wood for fire. Yes, but
          you don't go now.
          CLOSE on JANUSZ, intensely following the conversation.

          Why can't we go now?

                         OFFICIAL
          If big snow come - very difficult.
          You wait here until Spring. This
          family keep you.
          He confers with the LAMA.

                         JANUSZ

                         (TO SMITH)
          That's three months.

                         OFFICIAL
          (indicates the LAMA)
          He go to Lhasa. Get permission
          for to stay. Only to Spring. Not
          possible foreigners stay Tibet.
          SMITH bows his head, mutters thanks, all of the group
          doing likewise.

          214 INT. STABLES, SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 214

          THE SHEPHERD has seen JANUSZ, ZORAN and VOSS to their
          quarters. He passes VOSS a battered oil-lamp and retires
          with much bowing. They settle on the straw covered
          floor, laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets
          given to them by the shepherd's wife.

                         ZORAN
          Well, we can't cross in Winter.

                         JANUSZ
          He said it was 'difficult'.
          SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped
          space.

                         ZORAN
          I'm going to sleep 'till Spring.
          Like a bear in a cave. What about
          you, Mister?
          SMITH settles with his back to the wall, draws up his
          sheepskin.

                         SMITH
          I'm going to Lhasa.
          The others are stunned by this.

          The Lama has a contact - maybe get
          me out through China. There's a
          U.S. military mission there.
          They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them,
          breaking up the team.

                         ZORAN
          'Looking after number one.' Isn't
          that what Americans say?

                         SMITH
          Zoran?
          ZORAN eventually looks at him.

                         SMITH (CONT'D)
          We escaped. We made it.
          VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small
          window.

                         ZORAN
          He's right. I just realized it.

                         VOSS
          Realized what?

                         ZORAN
          Apart from a few mountains, we're
          there. We made it.

                         VOSS
          Not all of us.

                         ZORAN
          No. Not all of us.
          Their thoughts drift back to their lost companions.

                         ZORAN (CONT'D)
          What will you do, Mister? When
          you get home.

                         SMITH
          'Home'?

                         Z ORAN
          Build metros?

                         SMITH
          Might drift for a while.

          Haven't you had enough of that?
          CLOSE on JANUSZ, hardly listening, his thoughts
          elsewhere. Their late-night conversation drifts over
          him.

                         VOSS
          I will fight. First Germans, then
          Russians.

                         ZORAN
          Then re-build your church?

                         VOSS
          I will die fighting.
          This statement has an oddly prophetic sound. JANUSZ look
          across at him.

                         ZORAN
          I'm going to get Tomasz's pictures
          to a newspaper, or get them
          published somehow. Then I'm going
          to cook his chicken - but with
          extra salt just to annoy him.
          Chuckles from the group. 

                         SMITH
          And you, Janusz? 

          VOSS (TO SMITH) 
          As long as the Communists are in 
          Poland, he can't go back. 

                         ZORAN 
          They'd shoot you wouldn't they, 
          Janusz? 
          They settle down to sleep, outside the wind is picking 
          up. 

                         JANUSZ 
          I'll just keep on going. Until
          it's over. Keep on walking.
          SMITH looks through the gloom to where JANUSZ sits -
          moonlight slashes the side of his face, but he can't
          quite see his eyes.
          CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake. No thought of sleep.

          216 INT. STABLES - DAWN 216

          ZORAN and VOSS agitated at the discovery that JANUSZ has
          gone. Much coming and going in and out of the hut,
          checking that he isn't somewhere close by. Only SMITH
          remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the
          wall, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He expected
          nothing less. 

          217 EXT. HIMALAYAS - DAY 217

          Up ahead a figure, JANUSZ, dwarfed by the mountain chain,
          struggles on, climbing toward the snow-capped passes.

          218 EXT. HIGHER PASS DAY 218

          As he climbs he hears a cry, mingling with that of the
          wind - a voice echoing about the mountains. He ignores
          it for a few paces, before he looks back - far below two
          figures waving and calling - VOSS and ZORAN.

          219 EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE/VALLEY, TIBET/INDIA - DAWN 219

          The change from the barren mountains of Tibet, to the
          lush green of Sikkim is abrupt and startling - from rocky
          upper reaches the slope to the valley becomes rich in
          scrubby birch-woods, rhododendrons, and deciduous forest,
          until finally it becomes dense rain forest. It is with a
          backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look
          up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking
          bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost
          of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on
          their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They
          walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive.
          Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a
          POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while
          some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting
          into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their
          grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks?

          220 EXT. VALLEY PATH, INDIA - DAY 220

          Close on JANUSZ, VOSS, and ZORAN as the beaming POLICEMAN
          escorts them past dozens of smiling faces.

          swells, until the path is lined two and three deep on
          either side, like a welcoming crowd at the end of a
          marathon. Small children are held up for a better look,
          while hands reach out patting their backs and shoulders -
          it's as if they know these men have achieved something
          remarkable.
          Close on JANUSZ, as amongst the sound of the gathering
          crowd other voices join in, cheering voices, hundreds of
          them, rising in volume until the cheering changes into
          that of a chant, now seemingly swelled by thousands of
          voices. Still CLOSE on JANUSZ walking as behind him the
          Indian scene dissolves into a series of black and white
          images. (Throughout, the image of JANUSZ walking is from
          this scene in India).

          221 EXT. A HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 221

          The camera moves toward a gate in a hedge. The click of
          the latch as it opens. A downward view of the
          flagstones. The front door, the camera pans left. The
          loose brick. A hand into frame removes a key from behind
          the brick. Into the lock of the door, the door pushed
          open.

          222 INT. HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 222

          A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early
          seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the
          door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room
          appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG
          JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his
          wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his
           pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG
           JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to
          his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of
           suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's
           waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now
           as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see
          him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.
           Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her
          hand in his.

                                    James Gray

          
          
          
          FADE IN:
          
          A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY...
          THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the
          foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF
          MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems
          to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER
          LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.
          
          MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS
          BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN.
          
          SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS
          FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:
          
          New York, New York.   1988.
          
          A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing
          with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in
          recent memory.
          
          The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic
          groups rise up to seize control without respect for
          traditional rules of engagement.
          
          Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and
          scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their
          own at the rate of twice a month...
          
          The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER
          THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to
          ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING
          POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"...
                                                       SMASH CUT TO:
          
          CLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital
          and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are
          stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into:
          
          INT. STOREROOM
          
          The camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties,
          dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the
          wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     ...you're so fuckin' beautiful, you
                     know that...?
          
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                      2.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          She beams. They kiss, PASSIONATELY. SUPERIMPOSE:
          "BROOKLYN". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as
          they DEVOUR each other:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       I love you, baby...
          
          Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE:
          
                                       MUFFLED VOICE
                       Bobby!   You in there?
          
          No ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE
          BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues:
          
                                      MUFFLED VOICE (CONT'D)
                       Bobby! [If] you two could just
                       keep your hands off each other for
                       a second--I, I think we got a
                       situation brewin' out front!
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       It's Jumbo... We gotta go anyway...
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (beat; to the door)
                       I'll be out in a second, Louis!
          
          She grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again.
          She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio...
          
                                                         CUT TO:
          
          INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
          
          A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,
          pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,
          straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,
          fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.
          Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he
          appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his
          name. He is having a blast.
          
          Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of
          Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.
          He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS."
          Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a
          pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a
          swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,
          claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES
          every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.
          WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  3.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table,
          surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne-
          scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men,
          PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.
          
          NEAR THE COAT CHECK
          
          Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we
          SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats,
          slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their
          coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets.
          Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian
          with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of
          it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the
          DRUG TRADE.
          
          INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY
          
          A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons
          and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO
          moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI,
          forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around
          him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says "SECURITY" on it.
          He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby
          arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       What the fuck's goin' on in here?
          
          Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON,
          puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE
          TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend,
          watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly
          detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He
          balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding
          spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing
          his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got
                       everything under control here--so
                       uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take
                       my break!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Yeah--just keep that wide load of
                       yours outta trouble, arright?
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Yes, your fuckin' majesty!
          
          The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from
          Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor:
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                     4.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       What're you doing?!? You gotta
                       behave yourself here!
          
          Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS
          saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen
          drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap.
          Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE
          helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is
          flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON
          HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who
          hurls his guy out of frame):
          
                                      BLOODIED PATRON
                       C'mon, Mr. Green! I didn't do
                       nothing!
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Well now you're gonna do nothing
                       someplace else!
                              (louder, to all
                               fighters; pointing:)
                       Now listen--one of these days I'm
                       gonna run this whole block, and I
                       see any you in here again--any you--
                       I'll bust your fuckin' hole!
                              (to Freddie)
                       Throw `em out on their ass. I
                       gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys
                       with the old man.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL
          
          Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.
          
          INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM
          
          An ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors
          with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them.
          Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in.
          
          We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played
          downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits
          MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old,
          kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife,
          KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with
          the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.
          
                                       MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       Bobby!   Come here!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Mr. Buzhayev, how are you!
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                    5.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Bobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. The two EMBRACE
          WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev
          touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs
          BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly,
          amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment.
          
                                       KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)
                       So beautiful!   Beautiful!
          
          Bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention.
          Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do
                       something right now. But don't
                       worry--everything's in good shape
                       downstairs.
          
                                       MARAT BUZHAYEV
                              (warm, gentle)
                       Yes, good. You take care of things
                       good for us...
          
          Marat smiles.    Then, as Bobby stands:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
                       Next week, you come by--we talk.
                       Okay? We talk about plans for you.
          
          Bobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries
          to give him a small care package of food. He politely
          refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in
          Russian ("He said he didn't want any food, and you keep
          trying to give it to him!") breaks out between the old
          husband and his wife. As Bobby exits:
          
                                      KALINA BUZHAYEV
                             (broken English)
                       Bobby! Where you run off to?!?
          
          EXT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - SUMMER EVENING
          
          A modern church. A big crowd in front, made up of POLICE.
          We HEAR MUSIC. CLOSE SHOT of a black outdoor sign, behind
          glass. "OUR LADY, QUEEN OF MARTYRS CHURCH, QUEENS, NY".
          TILT DOWN: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling out
          "NYPD PULASKI SOCIETY MTG. - 7 PM". SUPERIMPOSE: "QUEENS".
          
          INT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - BASEMENT
          
          The MUSIC explodes down here. A large room with columns.
          Streamers, balloons everywhere. Old cops, young cops, men,
          women, are here. Skinny, portly, giddy, drunk.
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Many are IN UNIFORM, loosened up a bit, like they've just
          gotten off work and it's time to relax. Children run
          about. American, New York State flags. Pictures on the
          walls: people with plaques, portraits. ARCHIE BUNKER'S NEW
          YORK. A SIGN READS: "CONGRATULATIONS! TO `CAPTAIN JOSEPH
          GRUSINSKY'". Cases filled with trophies. Food tables,
          piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.
          
          Many COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making
          sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT,
          GAB, MAKE OUT. FLASH! Pictures taken constantly. A mass
          of people surround TWO PEOPLE as a PHOTO is taken:
          
          ANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER
          BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically
          so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is
          SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and
          holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next
          to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their
          older infant, TEDDY.
          
          NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we
          will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex-
          military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.
          
          Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates:
          MICHAEL SOLO ("G.Q."), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK
          SHAPIRO ("Pudge"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge
          hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured
          son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Here, take another one! Get
                       another!
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Pop, they got enough! What're you
                       doin'?!?
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                              (in Joseph's ear)
                       You want your face out there--it's
                       good exposure. The PC's gonna see
                       this.
                              (to the Photographer)
                       C'mon. With both kids.
          
          FLASH!
          
                                        PHOTOGRAPHER
                       Thanks, Chief!
          
          Burt waves to the Photographer, then leans again into
          Joseph's ear. Still wearing a smile for the outside world:

                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                           (shakes head; then)
                    He ain't gonna come.
          
                                    BURT GRUSINSKY
                           (frowns; then:)

          INT. CAR - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH
          
          A CLOSEUP of ROSARIO.    Beat.   Then:
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    C'mon. What's the big deal anyway?
                    We'll go in, you say hello, then
                    we'll go.
          
          Bobby seems reluctant.   Then:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You remember what I tol' you?
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Yeah!   Course!
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Nobody knows about my father and my
                    brother--not even Jumbo. And it's
                    gotta stay that way, you
                    understand?
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Yeah, you tol' me a thousand times.
                    But I been with you for two years,
                    Bobby--I should meet `em by now.
                    We goin' in or not?
          
          ANGLE ON BOBBY as we go to:
          
          INT. CHURCH STAIRWELL
          
          We MOVE past partygoers. THEN, APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE
          STEPS: Bobby and Rosario--who's being eyed up and down
          salaciously by the men in the party. The two start to come
          down the narrow stairs leading to the basement. A portly,
          ebullient man, RUSSELL DE KEIFER:
          
                                    RUSSELL DE KEIFER
                    Bobby? Bobby Grusinsky, that you?

                       It's me, Russell De Keifer, from
                       across Northern Boulevard,
                       remember? You still bartending
                       that Russian joint, out there in
                       Brooklyn?
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Nah.   Nah, I'm managing now.

                       Yeah. I'll see you `round, arright?
          
          Bobby slinks past De Keifer.     Rosario touches his arm:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       What'd he call you?

                              (slightly sheepish)
                       I changed my name--I use my
                       mother's name now. It's better for
                       business. C'mon...
          
          INT. BASEMENT
          
          A wiry YOUNG POLICE REPORTER, in uniform, moves to Joseph.
          Burt stands nearby, proud:
          
                                      YOUNG POLICE REPORTER
                       Captain Grusinsky, hi! I'm Officer
                       Timpanaro from SPRING 3100, the

                       How you doing...
          
          The Reporter reads his question off a small pad.      (VERY
          important that he come off like an amateur.)
          
                                      YOUNG POLICE REPORTER
                       So: um, you are now the third--
          
          Someone hits his arm.     He drops his pad, picks it up.

                       Feels like nothin'. Nah, it feels
                       good! I love trying to, you know,
                       help make the City safer for people
                       and everything...
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM:
          
          Bobby and Rosario come down the stairs. Bobby immediately
          SEES his family, though they don't see him yet. To
          Rosario, quiet:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       That's them there. In the corner.
                       Lookit `em--two peas in a pod.

                       Yeah--I see `em! They don't look
                       that bad though, you know? For

                       [My] Father's friends--they were
                       all in Korea together.
                              (with a laugh)
                       Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs...
                              (moves closer)

          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Bobby approaches, looks over to Sandra. The two nod an
          AWKWARD HELLO. Then the two brothers meet. We SEE the
          relationship between them. Strained, but a warmth deep
          UNDERNEATH:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY

          SIMULTANEOUS: Burt motions to JACK, MICHAEL.      The two WALK
          UPSTAIRS. Burt steps forward.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Hello.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Pop.
                              (Rosario moves near)
                       Everybody, this is my girlfriend.
                       Rosario.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Nice to meet you!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       This's my brother. And my father.
          
          Burt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with
          subdued "hellos." She is not exactly, well, PROPER-
          LOOKING. And she isn't white. She picks up on this, tries
          to act as though she doesn't care. Burt turns to Bobby:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       We gotta talk to you. Alone.
          
          ANGLE ON BOBBY. This gives him pause, but Rosario gives
          him a slight nod of her head, assuring him it's okay. So:
          
          INT. CHURCH - UPSTAIRS
          
          Jack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty
          main hall of the church. Looking for anyone who may be
          hanging out, ducking in and around. They spot a COUPLE,
          making out in one of the pews. The man is shirtless, the
          woman in her bra. Caught, they let out an embarrassed
          CHUCKLE. With offense, but also humor:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       In a house of God, no less? C'mon,
                       get up...
          
          The couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their
          clothes. As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph
          coming up the stairs. Joseph pulls up the rear, standing
          behind his father. Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated
          several rows back. BEAT, then:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)
                       Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got on.
          
          Bobby gladly gives a nod of recognition, sits down in an
          empty front pew. Burt brushes lint off his son's shoulder:

                                                                    11.

                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Your hair's long.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       I know. I like it this way.
                              (no response, so:)
                       That why you got me up here?    [To]
                       tell me my hair's too long?
          
          Joseph speaks up, diverting Bobby's attention:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Bobby, I asked Pop to bring you
                       here.
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                       Whatsamatter?
          
          Joseph eyes his father with trepidation, then begins:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Well... I'm gonna be heading up a
                       new narcotics team, starting this
                       week. A Russian unit, outta PSA 2
                       in Brighton.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (lights a cigarette)
                       That's a good hook for you.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Yeah, they need me over there.
                       There's only eleven guys in the
                       whole department that even know the
                       language right now, so...
          
          Bobby looks behind him. He's SURROUNDED. Interrogation-
          style, his brother at the fore, Bobby nonetheless remains
          calm, almost cheery. To Jack, in the back:
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                       You ever talk?
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       I'm old-fashioned. I listen first.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Bobby, we need you to do us a
                       favor.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (SMIRKING)
                       A favor? Oh, he needs a favor!
                              (to Burt, needling)

                    You cut me off financially, and now
                    you need the favor? `S interesting.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    PUDGE--
          
          Jack steps forward, a PHOTO in hand.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                    We're looking at this guy Vadim
                    Nezhinski.
          
          Puts the PHOTO in front of Bobby. MUG SHOT of an acne-
          scarred, dark-eyed man we've seen before: VADIM NEZHINSKI.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (O.C.) (CONT'D)

                    black market activity, come over
                    around 1979.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    `S good lookin' boy!
          
          Not amused, they withdraw the photo from in front of Bobby.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    He's dealing H, cocaine, angel
                    dust... Operates out of that club
                    you manage. The El Caribe.
          
          Bobby's sense of humor disappears now.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I don't know nothing about that.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    No, we know that. We checked up
                    and down the rest of management,
                    too--his uncle, the owner--
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    The old man?! What, you been
                    watching us?!?
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    Everybody come up clean. It's just
                    Nezhinski we're lookin' at.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (back to Burt)
                    What the fuck is this?

                    We need to track how he's bringin'
                    in the product and...we were just
                    hopin' you'd keep your eyes and
                    ears open a little.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You kidding me? Inform for you?!?
                    That's what you wanted me here for?
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    No, we would never ask you to do
                    that. Just observe, that's all.
                    It's a closed community and you're
                    our only way in right now--
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Yeah well, find another way. I got
                    a lot invested in that club and I
                    can't let it get fucked up.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    Nothing's gonna get fucked up,
                    Bobby. All it takes is one thing,
                    you know that! One guy to flip, we
                    crack the whole thing!
          
          Michael Solo pipes up from the back:
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    Bobby, it's important. These ain't
                    dumb guys we're talking about. We
                    don't stop `em up front, coupla
                    years from now, it'll be chaos out
                    there.
                           (BEAT)
                    We'd be wishing the Italians'd come
                    back.
          
          Bobby is still focused on his brother, then to his father:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    [You] Fuckin' broadsided me...
                    Everything's about the goddamned
                    job with you.
          
          Burt remains stoic. (Though silent so far, he should be a
          HUGE presence in the scene--others look to him for
          reaction, approval, etc.) Joseph sharpens:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    Whole city's falling apart, Bobby--
                    don't you got any sense of
                    responsibility at all?

                    horse and bust somebody else's
                    balls.

                           (finally, to Joseph)
                    All right, go downstairs. Lemme
                    talk to him.
          
          Burt gestures to Mike and Jack, and they exit. Joe doesn't
          respond at first. Then, begrudgingly, to Bobby:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    Thanks for coming.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN

                    Joseph!
          
          Joseph lingers, leaves. Father and son. ALONE. Then,
          staring straight ahead as he takes a drag of his cigarette:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Congratulations. You got me up
                    here.
          
                                   BURT GRUSINSKY
                    I knew you wouldn't help us. I
                    told your brother, I said, `no
                    point even bringing him down here.'
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    Good.   Then now you know.
          
          Bobby starts to leave.   Burt grabs his arm:

                    Why, you want some?
          
                                   BURT GRUSINSKY
                    Yeah, keep laughing--your mother,
                    rest in peace, I think she was too
                    easy on you.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you
                    `round.
          
          Bobby turns his back on Burt, getting up to walk
          downstairs. Burt remains emotional, reaching out to his
          son when Bobby is not looking, lowering it to no avail.
          
          INT. BASEMENT
          
          The music is off now. Bobby comes down, Burt follows.
          Joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another
          cop. A squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak: NYPD
          Deputy Commissioner SPIRO GIAVANNIS.
          
                                    SPIRO GIAVANNIS
                    Everyone?   Everyone!
          
          Rosario is leaning up against a post, drinking, watching
          the party. She stares down a GUY who OGLES HER
          LASCIVIOUSLY. With a sense of humor, she winks at him:
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    You take a picture, it'll last
                    longer.
          
          Bobby approaches Rosario, grabs her hand:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    C'mon, let's get outta here,
                    [we'll] go party with Jumbo.
          
          He tugs her away.   She stops him.   With assurance:
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    We could stay if you want, baby.
                    They don't like me, I don't care--
                    you're better than them anyway--
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (waves her off)
                    We're goin'. C'mon.

          She hurriedly puts down her drink. Joe stands near Spiro,
          but his attention is on his brother:
          
                                      SPIRO GIAVANNIS
                       I'm Deputy Commissioner Spiro
                       GIAVANNIS--
          
          APPLAUSE.    Bobby, Rosario move to the exit.   SIMULTANEOUS:
          
                                      SPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D)
                       You know, we look around in these
                       troubled times, and in moments like
                       this we need leaders, men and women
                       who can bring order back to our
                       great communities. We're here this
                       holiday season to give thanks for
                       one of these men, our Russian
                       brother, Joseph Grusinsky.
          
          CHEERS.   Joseph smiles, waves.   Filled with hubris.
          
                                      SPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D)
                       ...Joseph, many of us've known your
                       father, Deputy Chief Burt
                       Grusinsky, for many years, and I
                       know he wants to say a little
                       something. Chief?
          
          APPLAUSE for Burt, who waves, steps up:
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Thank you. You know, I used to
                       tell my kids, "work first, play
                       later," and my son Joseph really
                       took it to heart. He's been a real
                       fighter over the years... He
                       overcome his mother's passing, and
                       the dyslexia--eventually wound up
                       graduating John Jay as salutatorian
                       and distinguished himself many
                       times.
                              (turns to Joseph)
                       Anyway, you've shown yourself to be
                       very brave and selfless, and I'm
                       just, I'm very proud here tonight.
          
          BIG APPLAUSE as JOSEPH STEPS FORWARD. BOBBY AND ROSARIO
          squeeze through the crowd, to the stairs.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Thank you everybody for coming--
                       happy Thanksgiving. Before I say
                       anything else... We got some bad
                       news this morning.

                    One of our Irish brothers was
                    killed in the line of duty last
                    night--detective Edward Conlon was
                    gunned down serving a warrant on
                    Northern Boulevard. The clock's
                    about to strike ten, so I thought
                    we might give a moment of silence
                    to remember.
          
          BOBBY STOPS. Instinctively, he turns back to the room,
          motions to Rosario to stop. Out of respect. She does.
          Then: the CHURCH BELL rings. TEN TIMES. Silence. The
          BELL GONGS. The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his
          family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT,
          and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE,
          genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES
          at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return
          the glare, and Bobby exits...
          
          EXT. QUEENS STREET - FRONT OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          The camera TILTS UP to an apartment window.   We CUT INSIDE:
          
          INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
          
          MUSIC UP: PRINCE'S "HOUSEQUAKE." Hot girls and flashy-
          looking guys. The men are drinking. The women make
          themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the
          sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting
          ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are
          SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's,
          though not exaggeratedly so. DRUGS are EVERYWHERE. We
          MOVE PAST THIS TO:
          
          INT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM
          
          PAN around the ROOM: a set of weights on the carpeted
          floor, with clothes scattered everywhere; on the wall, a
          Jets football schedule, a Led Zeppelin poster. Bobby is
          PRIMPING in the mirror. Rosario stands on Bobby's king
          bed, DANCING SENSUALLY to the music in a state of partial
          undress. She MOVES with great FREEDOM, puffing on a JOINT.
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    I'm gonna be like Madonna. You
                    think I'm like Madonna...?
          
          Bobby sees Rosario in the reflection; his face lights up.
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
                    We're both Leos, you know.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You're just like her, baby...
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Bobby opens his top drawer to get a watch. REVEALS
          THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in CASH, hidden underneath a fake
          drawer bottom. Traces his fingers across the money with
          private pride, then puts on the watch. Rosario bounces
          down on the bed. Reaching under the bed sneakily, she
          pulls out a small box. She hides it. Then:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       I talked to my mother yesterday.
                       She said she'd be okay by herself,
                       so I could move in if I want...
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                       That's cool.
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                              (without self-pity)
                       Your family ain't gonna be too
                       happy, though. I saw how they
                       looked at me.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       It's all right--they don't like
                       nobody outside their own little
                       world.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Yeah...you know, cops're fucked up.
                       In my neighborhood, if they ain't
                       taking money, they're beating on
                       you for no reason...
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       My brother and my father ain't like
                       that. It's just--the whole thing
                       ain't for me, that's all.
          
          Bobby approaches her.       Takes a puff of HER JOINT.   Then,
          INTIMATELY:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       You know how gorgeous you are?
          
          Bobby pushes her down on the bed. Starts kissing her on
          the neck, lips, then breasts. Caressing her hips, he leans
          back and looks at her, observing the brightness and
          kindness of her face. Her eyes--mild, calm, and truthful--
          and her smile carry him into a wave of tenderness. He
          moves in to kiss her again, and under his breath:
          
                                        ROSARIO DIAZ
                       WAIT--
          
          She takes out a little JEWELRY BOX.

                                     BOBBY GREEN
                    What is it?
          
                                     ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Open it up!
          
          He opens it.   A CHAIN.   A SIMPLE GOLD CHAIN.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    ...it's beautiful...
          
          She takes it out, puts it around his neck. She has a HUGE
          SMILE, EAR TO EAR. He looks at her, moved. A FLOOD OF
          EMOTION. Sotto:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    ...you're so good to me...
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    I love you... And someday we're
                    gonna get a big house together, in
                    New Jersey, with a lotta kids...
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Only if you behave yourself...
          
          Bobby gently spreads her legs, starts to rub the inside of
          her thighs. Then moves to her breast. Kisses her with
          love. Rosario clutches him, secure. The DOORBELL RINGS.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
          
          A mussed Bobby ENTERS from the bedroom, passing the party.
          Bobby opens the FRONT DOOR: Louis, Hazel. Thrilled, he
          waves them in. When the rest of the room sees Louis, THEY
          SCREAM "JUMBO!" He holds his arms aloft, as if greeting an
          adoring crowd.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Uh oh--[The] party's really gonna
                    get started now!

                       Indeed I did, my friend!
                              (quieter, to Bobby)
                       See, I woulda been here sooner,
                       `cept I hadda go across town, lose
                       all the cops--
          
                                      HAZEL
                       There weren't no cops following us!
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Shut your mouth! You wouldn't
                       recognize `em--they were, they were
                       all undercover.
          
          Bobby laughs happily, knowing this is bullshit. Hazel
          shakes her head, joins the gals. Louis starts emptying his
          pockets. Out comes a pharmacy. DRUGS SPILL all over a
          formica endtable. Louder:
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
                       Anyway, I got a little of what
                       everybody asked for here. I got
                       uppers, downers, hash, mescaline,
                       some blow-

                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Yeah, you need that, not me!
          
          Bobby laughs again, PINGS Louis on the ear. Lou grabs his
          head, but ignores the needling. Louis looks up, observes
          Bobby's clothes:

                       And what's with the suit anyway?
                       You look like a monkey in the
                       circus!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I'm goin' up to see Buzhayev
                       tonight. I think he's gonna ask me
                       to buy into the club.
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Yeah? Well, you know what you
                       should do, you should turn it into
                       a fag joint and then maybe they'll
                       let ya in!

                       I'll show you a fuckin' faggot!
          
          Bobby starts to punch Louis in the arm, playfully but hard.
          Rosario enters the room, singing along with the song that's
          playing (YAZ'S "SITUATION"). She moves to Bobby's side,
          mock punches Louis' stomach too. To the gang, with CHEER:

          SILENCE, except for the CLICKING of GUN MECHANISMS.
          
          The troops gird for battle, checking their weapons. JOSEPH
          is here, as are Jack and Michael and a whole gang of cops.
          Bustling by a set of lockers. Very businesslike. Joseph
          cleans his piece. Michael leans over to him:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       The spot's got one main entrance,
                       two rear fire exits. All of `em'll
                       be covered.

                       Good. I just wanna make sure we
                       take it easy in there. We don't
                       want no panic.

                       What if your brother's inside?
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       It's his day off. He ain't gonna
                       be there.
          
          Joseph clicks his weapon into place.
          
                                        MICHAEL SOLO
                       What if he is?    We still go?
          
          Joseph is deeply troubled by the prospect.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)

          Bobby gleefully shakes hands upon entering, then splits
          from the group. Rosario joins several girls as they fix
          themselves up in front of large lobby mirrors...

                    Bobby! Our daughter and her
                    husband Eli come by for dinner.
                    You want something, some tea?
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    No no, I'm all right... Hi
                    everybody...
          
          A grown woman, Marat's daughter MASHA, waves while sifting
          through a stack of FURS on the sofa. One of her young
          children, a daughter, holds her hand.
          
          INT. DINING ROOM
          
          Marat sits at the head of a table with lots of FOOD
          (including a HUGE SMOKED FISH) on it. He waves Bobby over,
          ebullient. ELI MIRICHENKO, Masha's husband, is seated
          here, too--trying to talk to his young toddler SON. Bobby
          sits down, next to Marat.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Everything's really rockin'
                    tonight. Line's halfway `round the
                    block.
          
                                   MARAT BUZHAYEV
                    Yes, it's good...
          
          The toddler runs to Bobby. Bobby lifts the youngster onto
          his knee; as he bounces the child on his knee, he turns
          back to Marat:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You wanted to talk to me?
          
          Marat nods, waves to Kalina for drinks.
          
                                   MARAT BUZHAYEV
                    You know, maybe we open another
                    spot next year. Across from

                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       We need someone in charge here full-
                       time, then. And we think you do a
                       great job.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I appreciate that. You know, I
                       been thinking `bout it--I'd like to
                       become a partner here too--buy in
                       with you.
                              (BEAT)
                       I mean, I got a lot of ideas.

                       Already! He's got so many ideas!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Well, I just think we could do
                       more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead
                       Bay. I know a good spot--we add a
                       restaurant there, get the spill-
                       over. Like what your brother did,
                       in Miami.
          
          Marat nods, considering this. Reaches to the FISH. He
          takes the EYE out of the fish and starts to suck on it.
          Daughter Masha stands behind her seated husband, holding
          and bouncing her little girl. ELI antes up, to Marat:
          
                                      ELI MIRICHENKO
                       That's gonna take a lot of money,
                       Papa. Your fur business can
                       support that right now?
          
          Marat waves him off.    Turns back to Bobby, re Eli:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       My son-in-law, he worries people
                       take advantage of me.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I can understand that. But I got
                       money to invest--we could make it
                       something real special over there.
                       Do what I did downstairs--you know,
                       bring in name DJs on different
                       nights?

          Marat grins from ear to ear.   Excitedly, he nods.   Then:
          
                                   MARAT BUZHAYEV
                    Yes. Together we do it. You come
                    to our Thanksgiving again, on
                    Thursday?

                    Yeah, sure.   I'll come.
          
                                   MARAT BUZHAYEV
                    Good--we talk more, at the dinner.
          
          The two hug. Bobby is being shown out by Kalina, and is
          about to depart when Buzhayev calls to his wife in Russian:
          
                                   MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
                    Give him, for tonight!
          
          She reaches for her purse.   But Bobby refuses graciously,
          waving it off as he exits:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Nah nah, no thank you...

          Without a word, Louis motions:
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          At a large CORNER TABLE: VADIM NEZHINSKI, seated in the
          center. Surrounded by two YOUNG GIRLS and Slavic-featured
          men and dark-skinned Latinos. A LATINO MAN and one of
          Vadim's guys, a YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN, converse at
          the table. After a beat, the two men MOVE TO THE COAT
          CHECK AREA. CASH stacked on the edge of the table.
          ROSARIO appears, coming through the crowd. She goes to
          Nezhinski's table, counts out MONEY for him. Nezhinski
          appears affectionate with her, sticks some of the BILLS in
          her hands. Bobby turns away from Vadim's sight.

          The CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSE-UP on LOUIS:
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          
          INT. MEN'S ROOM - FLASHBACK
          
          It's the men's room in the club. Louis is in the stall,
          his pants pulled down. He HEARS: Nezhinski's voice and a
          muffled struggle. Louis immediately pulls his feet up,
          squatting on the toilet seat. Looks into the crack in the
          stall door. We STILL HEAR:
          
                                     LOUIS FALSETTI
                      Nezhinski dragged him into the
                      toilet. They stood him up against
                      the wall and held him--
          
          We SEE exactly this. Nezhinski faces the MAN. Two
          associates of Nezhinski's hold him back, covering his mouth
          with silver electrical tape.
          
                                     LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
                      They fuckin' pulled down his pants,
                      and I swear to God, Nezhinski just
                      cut it off.
          
          Nezhinski's associates pull down his pants, and Louis sees
          the man's bare ass. The man is panicking, muffled cries
          for help penetrating even the flashback. Nezhinski pulls
          out his switchblade, holds it up to his face, then LOWERS
          IT. A GLINT of REFLECTION on the KNIFE. HORRIBLE.
          
          INT. CLUB
          
          Back to the present.
          
                                     LOUIS FALSETTI
                      Worst thing I ever seen in my life,
                      Bob.
                             (BEAT)
                      Anyway, cops found his head in the
                      middle of Brighton Avenue the next
                      day--fuckin' dick was in his mouth.
          
                                     BOBBY GREEN
                      You sure it wasn't your dick?
          
                                     LOUIS FALSETTI
                      Yeah, that's funny.
                             (BEAT)
                      You sure it wasn't your mouth?
          
          Bobby laughs heartily. Just then, Vadim sees him. Pavel
          HOLDS UP HIS DRINK in acknowledgement and WAVES HIM OVER.
          
                                     BOBBY GREEN
                      Shit... I'll be right back.

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          VADIM'S TABLE
          
          Bobby walks   to the table. There's a lot of food around
          Vadim--he's   eating off six different plates. Bobby is
          really only   focused on Rosario. When Rosario sees him
          (she'd been   counting bills) she brightens, virtually
          getting out   of her seat:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Hi, honey!
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       Bobby--c'mon, join us! I wanna
                       talk to you!
          
          AD-LIB GREETINGS. Bobby sits between Rosario and
          Nezhinski. Rosario kisses him, grabs onto his arm; Vadim
          puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder. Turns to his people:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                       This is the fuckin' guy right here.
                       Practically owns the place.
          
          MUMBLED AGREEMENT. The men surrounding Vadim are "yes"
          men, and they seem to take their cue from him. To Bobby:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                       Everything all right with you?
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (nods; then, coolly:)
                       Things're goin' good.
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       That's real good... `Cause you
                       gotta be happy, you know? All my
                       guys, I tell `em, the mind and the
                       body, they're connected. That's
                       how you stay sharp.
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       This's "Kid Quick" you're talking
                       to, dude. Best fuckin'
                       middleweight in the Ukraine.
          
          Bobby looks at Vadim's ample waistline.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       He don't look like a middleweight
                       no more.
          
          Everyone LAUGHS, Vadim most of all. He KISSES Bobby on the
          head. Bobby looks at Rosario as Vadim continues:
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 28.

                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    You know Bobby, my uncle upstairs,
                    he, he likes you a lot. Practically
                    thinks you're one of his kids.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Your uncle's a great man. Smart
                    man.
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    Yeah... Smart smart stupid. Got
                    his head buried in books all day,
                    `stead of the real world...
          
          AD-LIB amusement from the "yes" men.   Vadim moves closer:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                    Listen uh, I come to you, I tell
                    you I got some friends bringin' a
                    load in here, maybe something big--
                    I'm just talking now--they bring it
                    in, how do you feel about that?
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Your uncle loses his license, he
                    ain't gonna be too happy.
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    Well, upstairs don't gotta know
                    everything, am I right? Place gets
                    packed every night, everybody wins.
          
          Bobby does not respond, instead nodding to some patrons who
          shout out hellos. Vadim shakes Bobby's shoulder with
          affection. Intimate:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                    You know, you should think about
                    comin' in with us. You're popular--
                    you could help us...expand a
                    little. A lotta money in it.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Yeah...I'll think about that.
                    Rosario--I wanna talk to you.
          
                                    VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    Go ahead.   We'll talk.
          
          Bobby takes Rosario by the arm away from the table.
          
          THE BAR
          
          As Bobby moves with Rosario to the bar:
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       It go good upstairs, baby?
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You gotta stop dealing. You hear
                       what I'm telling you?
          
          These words hit Rosario, and we SEE that she's troubled by
          her own behavior because she stares at her shoes,
          momentarily speechless. He grabs her:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       You hear what I said?
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Yeah, I heard. But I need the
                       money right now, Bobby. And I'm
                       not gonna rely on you for
                       EVERYTHING--
          
          Bobby purses his lips, frustrated.     Then:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Just hold off then, for a little
                       while. Okay? I got my reasons.
          
          Momentarily confused, she mutters a "'kay," then kisses
          him. Bobby moves the hair from Rosario's face.
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                       I love you...
          
          BOBBY'S ABOUT TO RESPOND IN KIND WHEN...       All of a SUDDEN:
          BOOM! PANIC. SCREAMING. LIGHTS.
          
          The DOORS at the club's entrance have burst open. LOUD,
          like a gunshot. COPS enter. Plainclothes and uniformed
          both. JOSEPH comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs
          around his neck. WITH COMMAND:
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Everybody! Get your hands on your
                       head and don't fuckin' move!
                              (to a woman)
                       Turn off that music. Right now!
          
          FOUR UNIFORMED COPS BOLT straight to    the COAT CHECK AREA.
          ALL KINDS OF DRUGS and WEAPONS start    falling to the FLOOR.
          The patrons are desperate to get rid    of any incriminating
          evidence, and BOTH MEN AND WOMEN RUN    TO THE BATHROOMS.
          
                                                                   30.
          
          
          
          INT. MEN'S ROOM
          
          Several patrons start DUMPING NARCOTICS INTO THE TOILET
          BOWLS when MANY COPS ENTER and, with ferocity, hit them
          with batons to corral them. The TOILETS are backing up...
          
          INT. WOMEN'S ROOM
          
          Some girls rush in, others are already inside. Two PRETTY
          YOUNG WOMEN are in the corner, FREEBASING, when COPS BURST
          IN. One of the Pretty Girls, out of surprise, starts to
          shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it. The opposite
          occurs, and the flame IGNITES THE ETHER. THE TWO GIRLS
          BURST INTO FLAMES.
          
                                   COPS
                    Holy shit! Get the extinguishers--
                    call paramedics!
          
          INT. MAIN ROOM
          
          The cops pin EVERYONE up against the wall or on the ground.
          EVERYONE IS LINED UP, SEARCHED. I.D.s are checked. Bobby
          turns to Rosario:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Gimme your shit!
          
          Troubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his
          palm. Bobby quickly SWALLOWS them. A UNIFORMED COP
          approaches Bobby:
          
                                   UNIFORMED COP
                    Hey! I saw that! Get your hands
                    on your fuckin' head!
          
          Bobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched; Rosario
          is tossed aside. The Uniformed Cop, to someone else:
          
                                    UNIFORMED COP (CONT'D)
                    Jessie!   This one just ingested!
          
          All patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly
          lined up, HANDS CLASPED on the backs of their heads.
          PARAMEDICS SPEED to the LADIES' ROOM. JESSIE THE COP takes
          out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and
          forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal:
          
                                   PARAMEDIC
                    Arright, open up--a little
                    charcoal, to absorb the toxin...
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       31.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          As Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with
          confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is
          uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Give everybody a toss. G.Q.--
          
          This gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to
          him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to
          LOUIS, pokes his gut:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Too much pizza, right there.
          
          Several COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice
          versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness
          muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has
          his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart.
          (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on
          Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED:
          
                                        JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Turn around...    Turn around!
          
          Vadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him.          He pulls
          a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       What is this?
                              (BEAT)
                       Want me to double your money? Huh?
          
          Vadim doesn't answer. Joseph takes out a HUGE SWISS ARMY
          KNIFE he's got on his keychain. He cuts the wad in half.
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Okay.   It's doubled now, how's
                       that.
          
          Michael and Jack search the other members of Vadim's party.
          They rip out pockets. Michael points to a WOMAN'S FUR:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       You got anything in there?
          
          He motions for the MINK. She hands it over.       HE PATS IT
          DOWN CAREFULLY. NOTHING.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          The Uniformed Cop puts handcuffs on Bobby and others.
          Rosario watches, upset but powerless. Louis is down, next
          to Bobby. Unwittingly referring to Bobby's brother:

                    Hey! Fat Albert! Shut your
                    fuckin' mouth!
          
          SEVERAL OFFICERS charge through now, PULLING THE LATINO MAN
          AND THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN (in cuffs) from behind
          the coat check. Bobby is pulled up, on his feet.
          
          BACK TO
          
          Joseph interrogating Vadim.   As he looks through I.D.:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (SUBTITLE)
                    You got a cross AND a Jewish star
                    on you?
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
                    The cross is for good luck.
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    What's the star for?
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    That one's for God.
          
          Just then, MICHAEL SOLO interjects.   In Joseph's ear:
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    Coupla dimes on `em--cocaine, a
                    little PCP.
          
          Joseph nods, acknowledging this news.    He EYES Vadim, then
          turns to the TWO MEN:
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    Okay, let's go. You. And you--
                           (to the Young Man)
                    You're under arrest, possession and
                    sale of narcotics--
          
          Michael reads two other men, one of whom is a TALL MAN from
          near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their Miranda rights
          in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them.
          
          PARAMEDICS exit the WOMEN'S ROOM.   Girls are on STRETCHERS.
          
          MARAT BUZHAYEV enters the main room of the club. He is
          ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously
          NOT ARRESTING HIM. They are asking him questions and
          writing down his comments. He TURNS TO SEE:
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          
          A HUMILIATED BOBBY, who eyes him back. Bobby is then
          quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat
          watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left
          behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM.
          Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the
          Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Your boy's gonna turn. And then
                    we'll come back for you.
          
          JOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE
          BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE
          YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back
          to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is
          hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed...
          
          INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HOLDING CELLS
          
          The station: 1980's-era, very unlike ones seen on T.V. The
          walls are tan brick, peppered with fallout shelter signs.
          Archaic, Robert Moses era-like. Lit entirely by large
          fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and
          typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies.
          A big sign above a bulletin board reads, "WE OWN THE
          NIGHT." Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse.
          There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE.
          
                                   PORTLY COP
                    Jesus Christ, what the hell's goin'
                    on in here?
          
          The Young Dark-Skinned Man is right outside the cell, his
          body in spasm, covered with blood coursing from his neck.
          Cops huddle around him as he kicks and screams.
          
                                   UNIFORMED COP
                    Russian guy fuckin' slashed
                    himself!
          
          After seeing this, Bobby is shoved in his cell, his nose
          still leaking the charcoal, blood all over his shoes.
          After a beat, he lies down on the cot...
          
          EXT. STATION - DAWN
          
          Bobby exits, walks toward the nearby SUBWAY STATION.   SPOTS
          BURT, who's waiting for him. Bobby ignores him:
          
                                   BURT GRUSINSKY
                    Where you going? I was the one who
                    got you outta there!

                       Thanks a lot.    I appreciate it.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       You're a real big shot, aren't you!
                       You see what happened in there last
                       night? Hey--I'm talking to you!
          
          Burt grabs his son's arm.      Moves closer:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       You know, you and your
                       girlfriend're only getting off
                       `cause of your brother. Up to me,
                       you'd sit in there another couple
                       days.
          
          Bobby looks around. Nobody's listening. He opens up.
          With quiet but real fury, and total sarcasm:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Okay, I'll go thank him too then.
                       He comes in, raids the fuckin'
                       place--now I gotta go beg `em not
                       to fire me--
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Fire you?! From what? Probably
                       the best thing that ever happened
                       to you!
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                       Fuck you, Pop.    Fuck the both of
                       you's.
          
          Enraged, Burt SLAPS his SON on the side of the head:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Don't EVER speak to me like that
                       again. You hear me? I'll rap you
                       right in the mouth!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna
                       fuckin' touch me?!?
          
          Bobby COCKS HIS FIST. BUT BURT IS READY. A STANDOFF.
          Then Bobby decides against it, bolts. On BURT as we GO TO:
          
          INT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          BOBBY ENTERS. Packed with people. A family get-together
          for Thanksgiving. Children abound, a PARTY atmosphere.
          BOBBY is in the FOYER, holding a cake he's brought.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Several FURS laid out on a felt-covered bench. Into the
          LIVING ROOM, he sees Masha and ELI seated on the couch,
          holding the hand of their son, who is dressed in a striped
          suit. Upon seeing Bobby, ELI NODS TO HIM and Masha enters
          the foyer, greeting Bobby with a kiss on both cheeks and
          taking the wrapped present from him.
          
          INT. DINING ROOM
          
          Bobby enters. Sitting at the large table is MARAT, playing
          with one of his grandchildren. Bobby knocks on the
          doorframe to announce his entrance. When Buzhayev spots
          him, the child hides behind Marat's leg. Marat lets out a
          laugh at this; to the child:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       No no--it's okay. Say hello...
          
          The boy waves perfunctorily.
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
                       Now--we go this week to the field,
                       okay? To ride the horses? Go to
                       Mama.
          
          Marat addresses the boy clutching his leg (AD-LIB a Russian
          "go"), kisses him, and the child runs off. Bobby steps
          closer to Marat:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry
                       about what happened the other
                       night.

                       but... Anyway, I'm sorry.
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       It's not your fault...
          
          Marat darkens considerably. More interior tone, almost as
          much for himself as for Bobby:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
                       You can't always control everyone
                       in your family...

                       You don't mind my saying, I think
                       that's probably the right thing to

                       We need time for the bad publicity
                       to go away.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested
                       ain't gonna be a problem. I don't
                       got a record--

                       I know.   I don't worry about any of
                       that.
          
          He puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder.

                       do it. Okay? Someday.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Yeah...   All right...

                       Food is ready!
          
          Marat looks at Bobby with great sympathy as they walk
          toward the LIVING ROOM.
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       You take some time off, everything
                       will be fixed in a little bit.
                       Then you come back. I pay you for
                       the time. Come on...
          
          Bobby mutters a "THANK YOU." Buzhayev touches his cheek.
          Marat then turns back into THE DINING ROOM, spreading his
          arms affectionately and wide, yelling "OHHH" to the
          children as they cheer. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we GO TO:
          
                                                                   37.
          
          
          
          INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - UPSTAIRS OFFICE
          
          Present: Joseph, Michael, Jack. Joe's seated at the head
          of a long table, which is covered with coffee, deli
          sandwich remnants, and police reports, etc. They are
          working; we greet them in media res.
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                     He stabbed himself, he was a bundle
                     guy. Mighta known how they're
                     movin' it. See, that's the key--
          
          ALL OF A SUDDEN, IN COMES BOBBY.   Intense beat.    Finally:
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                     We waited `til it was your day off.
                            (BEAT)
                     We had to go--I'm sorry.
          
          Beat.   Bobby takes a step toward him:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     You had to hit that spot.
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                     Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby!
                     What am I supposed to do--announce
                     it in advance, compromise the whole
                     thing?
                            (BEAT)
                     C'mon.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     I had plans down there.
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                     Yeah, well, I tried. What do you
                     want from me, anyway? You know,
                     you're standing there feeling sorry
                     for yourself, but you wouldn't be
                     in this shit if you didn't fuck
                     around in the first place.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     You got real balls saying that to
                     me. I made something for myself,
                     and you come in and fuck it up?
                     Just `cause I'm not trying to be
                     like you? And Pop--
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                     Bobby, you're the one acting like
                     you're above it all all the time!

                       Fuckin' around with your little
                       Puerto Rican all day--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       What did you call her?
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       You heard me. Have some fucking
                       class for once.
          
          Bobby takes another confrontational step forward.       Raging:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You piece of shit...
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                              (ignoring him)
                       [You] go around like you're a big
                       shot... You're a joke! Grow up
                       already! Fuckin' loser...
          
          Bobby LUNGES forward, grabbing his brother. Joseph leaps
          up out of the chair. A FIGHT. Awkward punches are thrown.
          Messy. Jack and Mike leap in, trying to pull the two
          apart, hollering "BREAK IT UP" AD-LIBS. The two are split
          up, panting...
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       You come at me like that...?
                              (BEAT)
                       Don't come around me no more--I
                       don't wanna have to look at your
                       fuckin' face ever again.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Fine with me, you motherfucker!
          
          Bobby exits, slamming the door.    ANGLE ON JOSEPH,
          distressed. Silence, then:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       I don't know, Joe--forgive me, but
                       uh, your brother... Ever since
                       your mother got sick--
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                              (INTERRUPTING)
                       Do me a favor, don't get involved.
                              (BEAT)
                       We'll pick this up tomorrow. I'm
                       gonna go home.
          
          Michael is quieted as Joseph packs his briefcase...
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
          
          EXT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Joseph drives up to the house, a working-class part of
          Queens. He parks the car.
          
          INT. CAR
          
          Joseph looks at his knuckles. They are bruised and
          bleeding. Emotional about the fight, he looks toward his
          lit house, then opens the car door.
          
          EXT. CAR
          
          Joseph drops his keys as he exits. Reaching down for them
          on the asphalt, he HEARS a SOUND and LOOKS up and to his
          left. A MAN WITH A HOOD OVER HIS HEAD. Looks almost like
          an old-time Klansman, with two holes cut into the hood for
          his eyes. He's pointing a GUN RIGHT AT JOSEPH. Joseph's
          eyes pop, and he lets out a quick gasp--but he has no real
          time to react. The man pulls the trigger.
          A THUNDERCLAP slaps the silence in the neighborhood:   THE
          GUN HAS FIRED. A FLASH OF LIGHT.
          
          A MIST OF BLOOD plumes around Joseph's head. The bullet
          hits Joseph in the face, through the CHEEK. HE snaps back
          spasmodically.
          
          AN AUTOMOBILE, a MONTE CARLO, pulls up to the scene of the
          crime. Another HOODED MAN in the back seat throws what
          looks like a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL into Joseph's CAR. The AUTO
          starts to BURN. Joseph lies on the sidewalk, bullet in the
          head, his blood everywhere. He seems pretty dead to us.
          The Monte Carlo SPEEDS OFF.
          
          INT. MONTE CARLO
          
          The Shooter slumps into his seat, ducking out of sight of
          the street. He pulls the hood off, over his head. It is
          VADIM NEZHINSKI. In Russian:
          
                                    VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
                     Get us onto the expressway... Move!
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Joseph, on the ground. The car burns in relative silence.
          Dogs barking in the neighborhood. A beat.
          
          INT. POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE BOXING GYM - NIGHT
          
          The PAL gym, filled with off-duty cops boxing, jumping
          rope. BURT hits a large bag that swings from the ceiling.
          He is dressed in sweatpants and a V-neck undershirt.
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 40.
          CONTINUED:
          
          As he hammers away, he is involved in some CHEERFUL BANTER
          with fellow cops:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       You gotta keep your hands up! Keep
                       your hands up!
          
          Then he SEES, in a LARGE MIRROR: TWO UNIFORMED COPS and the
          POLICE CHAPLAIN EDWIN O'CONNOR, standing near the doorway.
          He stops his exercise. They approach him.
          
                                       UNIFORMED COP
                       Chief...?
          
          After a long beat, Burt's expression changes, and he senses
          something bad. A long look at the men. Then:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Which kid is it?
          
          The cops turn to each other. Burt tries to prep himself,
          but it's impossible; we SEE the cracks in his sangfroid:
          
                                      POLICE CHAPLAIN
                       It's Joseph. He's at St. John's
                       Hospital.
                              (BEAT)
                       It don't look good right now.
          
          Burt does his best to stay stoic.
          
                                      UNIFORMED COP
                       You want us to contact your other
                       son--?
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                       No.   Go on, I'll be right out...
          
          Hesitantly, they leave. He crouches near his gymbag.
          Closes his eyes. The color drains from his face. Then,
          seeing other cops eyeing him:
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       What're you lookin' at?!?
                              (SOFTER)
                       It's got nothing to do with you...
          
          ALL OF A SUDDEN, as if he's been SHOT, he COLLAPSES.
                                       RANDOM BOXING OFFICERS
                       Chief!   Chief, you all right?
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
          INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          SMOKE AND DRINK everywhere. MADONNA'S "DRESS YOU UP" plays
          in the background. CROWDED. Bobby, Rosario, and Louis are
          at the center of a poker game. Lou sits next to Bobby,
          partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear
          from time to time. Rosario sits next to Bobby and watches
          the game intently.
          
          The poker pot seems exceptionally large. A STOCKY LATINO
          MAN is the main one competing with Bobby. Bobby's a mess,
          maybe worse than we've yet seen him. But he is HAPPILY
          DRUNK, his eyes BLOODSHOT. He and Louis look at their
          cards. Rosario turns, looks at Bobby for a BEAT. She sees
          a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Baby, you got a little bruise here--
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    That ain't nothing.
          
          He starts rubbing her between the legs, under the table.
          She kisses his bruise again. Louis pokes her. Smiling and
          pointing to his crotch:
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    I got a bruise too, you know--right
                    here!
          
          Rosario lets out a loud laugh.   Louis whispers pearls of
          wisdom to Bobby:
          
                                    LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
                    So Bob, I think we fold.
                           (BEAT)
                    We fold, right?
          
          Bobby ignores him.   Instead, aloud, to the Latino man:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    We'll see you and bump you two C's.
          
                                    LOUIS FALSETTI
                           (whispered too loud)
                    We will?
          
          Bobby turns to him, winks. The PHONE IS RINGING. A LOT.
          ROSARIO gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and
          picks up with a soft "hello". Meanwhile, Bobby puts a
          whole lot of cash in the middle. The Latino Man looks at
          him like he's crazy. Finally:

          Bobby takes a SHOT OF LIQUOR.    Turns over his cards.    He
          has a pair of QUEENS:
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two
                       fucking queens!
          
                                      STOCKY LATINO MAN
                       Goddamnit!
          
          A pair of tens. Bobby stands, CLAPS ONCE.       Lou, thrilled,
          jumps up and HUGS Bobby.
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Bobkes, I love you!
          
          Rosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she
          calls out to Bobby:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby--it's for you!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Who is it?
          
          She shakes her head as if to say, "I don't know." Slightly
          peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the
          table. As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly:
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       I was the one told him to keep
                       goin'!
          
          Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the
          phone, several feet away from the ruckus. He covers his
          free ear with his hand to hear better:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Hello?
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO (PHONE FILTER)
                       Bobby, it's Michael Solo--I got
                       some bad news.
                              (BEAT)
                       Your brother's been shot. He's at
                       St. John's--they're workin' on him
                       now. I just thought you should
                       know.
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                      43.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
          Bobby, of course, is stunned. The poker table in the
          background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message
          Bobby's getting. He turns his back to the crowd; sotto:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Is--is he gonna be all right?
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    Listen, your father's coming--I
                    gotta go. But he's at St. John's.
          
          HANG UP. Bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same.
          Rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him.
          
                                     ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Bobby?
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    My brother was shot...they're
                    operating on him now.
          
          Rosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is.     She
          pulls him to her:
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    You gotta go see him--be there for
                    him and your father.
          
          Bobby eyes her, walks to the table.      A CLOSE SHOT on him.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Game's over, everybody.
          
                                   STOCKY LATINO MAN
                    What, you shuttin' it down?!?
          
                                     BOBBY GREEN
                    That's right.    I gotta go.
          
                                    LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Bobkes--?   What's wrong?
          
                                     STOCKY LATINO MAN
                    Fuck you, man!    We're in deep here!
          
          Bobby grabs his coat. Rosario responds in kind, moves to
          Bobby. He spins to her. In hushed tones:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    What're you doing?
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    I wanna come too. For you--
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                44.
          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    No--it's gonna be a fuckin' scene.
                    I'll call you later.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                    BOBBY--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                    Don't argue.
          
          Bobby moves to Louis:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    Louis, lock up and take her home.
          
                                    LOUIS FALSETTI
                           (confused, he nods)
                    Sure, Bob. Everything cool?
          
          Hurt, Rosario spins around and enters Bobby's room, closing
          the door behind her.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta
                    do something, that's all--
          
          Pats Louis' arm as if to reassure him. Then the Latino Man
          tries to grab some of the pot. OTHER PLAYERS REVOLT:
          
                                      OTHER PLAYERS
                    Hey--HEY!     What the fuck?!?
          
          A FIGHT BREAKS OUT. Louis moves over to the WOMEN, holding
          them back (odd--they weren't going anywhere to begin with):
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Take it easy, TAKE IT EASY! Calm
                    down and everything'll be, uh, non
                    compos mentis!
          
          PUSHING, SHOVING. PUNCHING. Bobby exits his place,
          leaving behind Rosario and Louis and chaos...
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Bobby walks briskly to the entrance. MEDIA are all around,
          but they aren't paying attention to him. They are
          elsewhere, with members of the police, each other, etc....
          
          INT. E.R. WAITING ROOM
          
          He enters. The room is jammed with officers and friends,
          including many faces from the opening party.
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                   45.
          CONTINUED:
          
          Most of the cops don't seem to recognize Bobby at all.    All
          the NEWS MEDIA are outside, banned from the hospital's
          interior.
          
          BURT emerges from the hallway. He sees Bobby, at first
          comforted by the sight of his son. But quickly he darkens,
          and starts to walk right past him. Sotto:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Pop?
          
          Burt keeps walking.    Bobby follows:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Pop, he all right?
          
          Bobby touches his father's arm, and Burt spins around:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       What do you want? You stayed out
                       of it--you got what you wanted.
                       Why don't you go somewhere and pick
                       a fight--you're good at that!
          
          Bobby is speechless for a moment. Burt pulls his arm away
          and walks on. A MUSTACHIOED COP approaches Burt:
          
                                      MUSTACHIOED COP
                       Chief, the union sent a shrink over
                       for you--
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Nah, I don't want that crap.
          
          ENTER: someone we recognize as the MAYOR storms in with his
          ENTOURAGE. The COMMISSIONER (WILLIAM RUDDY--we'll see him
          later) and Deputy Commissioner Spiro Giavannis are with him
          too. They approach Burt. Bobby moves aside.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Hello, your honor. Commissioner.
                       Thank you for coming.
          
                                      MAYOR
                       Chief Grusinsky, an attack on an
                       officer is an attack on society.
                       Whoever did this, in a clean
                       neighborhood like that--they gotta
                       be hunted down like animals.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       We'll get `em, your honor. I'm
                       gonna come back in and run it
                       myself--we'll get `em.

          Meanwhile: MICHAEL takes Bobby's arm, walks him into:
          
          INT. SMALL PHONE ROOM
          
          A small room with payphones. There's a window through
          which we can SEE the WAITING ROOM.
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    The shot went in his cheek and come
                    out through the jaw. It missed his
                    brain, thank God.
          
          CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY.
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)
                    He was real lucky--considering.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (almost to himself)
                    I need to see him...
          
          Bobby starts to exit.   Michael stops him:
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    Bobby--that ain't a good idea.
                           (BEAT)
                    I probably should've told you not
                    to come down here--there're a lotta
                    things going on right now.
          
          A beat, then:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You guys blaming me for this? Is
                    that it?
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    Listen, I ain't judging you--I
                    called you `cause I thought you had
                    a right to know. But we're gonna
                    be going hard after Nezhinski--and
                    maybe some other people you're
                    close to. Like that girl you know--
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    That's bullshit--she's clean.      You
                    fuckin' keep away from her.
          
          Bobby realizes that NO ONE WANTS HIM HERE. He looks
          through the glass to SEE Burt, still speaking to the Mayor.
          Bobby storms out of the room to:
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          He turns toward Intensive Care. SEES a CROWD DOWN THE
          HALL. Two GUARDS block the doors to the ward. Determined,
          Bobby decides to walk over.
          
                                   GUARD
                    Sorry. Nobody's allowed in except
                    immediate family.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    Yeah.   That's me.
          
                                   GUARD
                    You got some I.D.?
          
          Bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet. As he does, we HEAR
          a SOFT CHIME. A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDS on the P.A.:
          
                                   WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Good evening. As a friendly
                    reminder, visiting hours will be
                    over in five minutes. Thank you.
          
                                   GUARD
                    Says here your name is "Green."
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Look--I'm his brother, you fuckin'
                    hard-on!
          
                                    GUARD
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Bobby stares at the men for a beat, then makes his move.
          Charges past the Guard.
          
                                    GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Hey!
          
          The Guards stop him, and a messy struggle ensues.
          
          All of a sudden, Joseph's wife SANDRA emerges from the
          ward. She looks devastated. The struggle stops. All fall
          silent, out of respect. Bobby steps back. Sandra turns to
          look at Bobby. To the Guards:
          
                                    SANDRA GRUSINSKY
                    It's okay.
          
          Bobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to
          read his mind, speaks:
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  48.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      SANDRA GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       He's alone. Your father just left
                       for the precinct.
          
          Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "THANK YOU." The Guards step
          aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS:
          
          INT. WARD
          
          Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face
          is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward.
          
          Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the
          CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is
          completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages
          that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion
          surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN.
          
          It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't
          expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open
          slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at
          Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm
          gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand.
          Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden:
          
                                      NURSE
                       Sir...?
          
          Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The
          connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs
          them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking
          OUTPOURING of FEELING from him.
          
          He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:
          
                                       NURSE (CONT'D)
                       Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting
                       hours are over.
          
          He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He
          backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a
          CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO:
          
          INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY
          
          A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on
          the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE.
          
          Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught.
          He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino
          teens smoking CRACK.
          
          He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the
          door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN.
                                                            (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                   49.
          CONTINUED:
          
          Behind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is
          clearly Rosario's mother.)
          
          INT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER
          
          Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He
          and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes
          for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then,
          barely audible, his voice cracking:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       ...Feels like it was my fault...
          
          He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach.
          She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head.
          
          She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering
          "no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this
          moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy...
          
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT
          
          Across from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm
          in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and
          drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and
          Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses
          Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She
          looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine.
          Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and
          is busy putting on a show--as usual:
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Where'd you run off to, like a Jew?
                       You got outta there, it became like
                       a real zoo. The spics--
                              (looks to Rosario)
                       `Scuse me--the P.R.s, they're goin'
                       nuts for the money--picka picka
                       picka picka--and the girls, they're
                       screamin', and I'm keepin'
                       everybody in line. I'm fuckin'
                       bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--I'm
                       fuckin' bustin' heads--
          
          He gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in
          the clumsiest manner possible. Accidentally kicks the
          waitress, who's bringing the check.
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
                       Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that.
          
          Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash.
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Hercules, do me a favor--before you
                       kill a waitress, go pay the check.
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Arright. But I'll tell you Bobkes,
                       nobody else could ever do for you
                       what I did.
          
          Louis smiles, walks off.    Scoops up the tip from a nearby
          table.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Don't tell Louis nothing about what
                       happened. Far as he knows, my
                       family moved away, [a] long time
                       ago.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       I ain't ever gonna say nothing! I
                       just thought...maybe he could cheer
                       you up a little.
          
          Bobby kisses her atop her head. JUST THEN: VADIM AND HIS
          GANG enter the establishment. They create a ruckus.
          Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       Hey, look who's here!
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Hey Vadim...
                              (as Vadim approaches)
                       We were just gettin' something to
                       eat.
          
                                       VADIM NEZHINSKI
                              (nods; to Bobby:)
                       You make it through that bust okay?
          
          Bobby gives a simple nod as well. Inside, Bobby is
          extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I didn't have nothing on me.
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       Glad to hear it.
          
          Without making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Your uncle's got some problems now,
                       though.

                                                                   51.

                           (SHRUGS)
                    He does what he gotta do, I do what
                    I gotta do. He don't own me.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (to Rosario)
                    Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo
                    company, make sure he leaves a tip.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                    `Kay...
          
          Rosario leaves the table.    Two GIRLS walk by:
          
                                      GIRL
                    Hi, Bobby!
          
          Bobby nods to them.    Vadim watches them walk away.   Then:
          
                                    VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    You know--
                           (moves closer;
                            WHISPERED:)
                    I still got my shit coming in.
                    Some of us think you could help get
                    it out there.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    It's a little dangerous right now,
                    don't you think?
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    We got a lot of muscle behind us.
                    Lotta muscle.
          
          The brazenness of the comment shocks Bobby. He looks up,
          begins to focus. Incredulous. Softly, as the camera ZOOMS
          INTO a CLOSE ANGLE on BOBBY:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                    Muscle--?
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    That's right.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    A cop got hit today. They ain't
                    never gonna sit still for that.
          
          Another member of the gang speaks up: Pavel:

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          
                                   PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                    Police are a fuckin' joke, dude--
                    the Mickey Mouse ain't gonna do
                    nothing.
          
          Pavel LAUGHS, and Bobby looks at him with real resentment.
          Vadim pushes Pavel aside, motions for him to sit down
          elsewhere. Vadim pulls up a chair. Sits down. Intimate:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    Bobby, those cops--they, they ain't
                    no problem.
          
          Vadim turns over his hand.   A SPIDER WEB TATTOO graces the
          palm of his right hand:
          
                                    VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                    You see this? I got this on the
                    inside, at Tchita. You earn these.
                           (QUIET)
                    So don't worry--we'll get `em all.
                    Cut off the head, the body'll fall,
                    right? You keep on doin' it `til
                    they get the message.
                           (even quieter)
                    We got all their names. On a list.
          
          Vadim leans back in his chair. Bobby's eyes widen. Vadim
          makes a "POP" sound. Bobby tries to hide his shock. Vadim
          grabs Bobby's arm, squeezes it.
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI CONT'D)
                    Just think about it. You change
                    your mind, you call Pavel.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (nods; then)
                    I'll see you around...
          
          And the men move to another table. Bobby looks at Rosario
          and Louis, who're standing by the register. They turn back
          to Bobby and SMILE, totally unaware of the conversation
          that's just taken place. CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY as we GO TO:
          
          EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO
          
          It's a huge municipal structure.   Bobby bolts inside.
          
          INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA TWO - ENTRANCE
          
          The place is hopping, with police everywhere. Almost like
          a fraternity house. BOBBY CHARGES IN, looks around.
          Pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk.

          CONTINUED:
          
          SERGEANT PROVENZANO, forties, rings a SILVER BELL, which is
          engraved with the words, "Homicide Bell." The room quiets
          down. Provenzano holds up his hands. Grinning:
          
                                       SERGEANT PROVENZANO
                       Everybody! Our little "A" House
                       got another coupla stiffs today, so
                       it's time for another poem!
                              (catcalls; reads from
                               a pad)
                       "The people of Brooklyn have been
                       volleyed and thundered; at last the
                       number slaughtered has reached one
                       hundred!"
          
          APPLAUSE. Provenzano bows.        BOBBY shoves his way through
          the crowd. Urgently:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I need to find Deputy Chief
                       Grusinsky.
          
                                      SERGEANT PROVENZANO
                       Oh, uh, he's on the second floor, I
                       think. In the muster room.
          
          EXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HALLWAY
          
          Bobby looks down the hall.       He SEES his father, talking to
          a CROWD of UNIFORMED COPS.       Burt sees him, keeps talking.
          Bobby touches his arm.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Pop, I gotta talk to you.
          
                                         BURT GRUSINSKY
                       I'm working.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       It's important--I got information.
          
          Bobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the
          two of them are out of earshot of others. Forcefully:
          
                                         BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       It's about you.
          
          Burt is surprised.       His attention sharpens:
          
                                         BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       It's bad.
          
          Burt realizes the severity.       Then we HEAR:
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

                       Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding
                       me!
          
          INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - MUSTER ROOM
          
          A large room, lit by fluorescents. Mostly empty of
          furniture in the center, with vending machines against the
          wall and a sole IBM PC in a corner. A huge GUN RACK is on
          the wall, conspicuous, a hint perhaps of the violence to
          come. It is Bobby and Burt, Jack and Michael. Bobby's
          been telling his story. He and Burt are seated--Jack looks
          out the small window in the door, then turns the LOCK for
          privacy; and a nervous Michael is pacing:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Nezhinski got a hit list? On us?!?
          
          Bobby looks at his father, then nods.      Mouths an almost
          INAUDIBLE:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Yeah...
          
          Michael purses his lips, then spins around to Burt.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       We gotta go bust `em, Burt--right
                       now.
          
          ANGLE ON BURT.    He betrays no hint of concern:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       No. They'll be back on the street
                       in a day. We gotta try and catch
                       `em with their hands full--find out
                       where they got the real weight.
                       Then we can move.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       That could take us forever!
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Doesn't matter. It's our only play.
          
          Uncustomarily, Jack speaks:
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       I say we go hit `em all. Wipe `em
                       out, suicide-by-cop--
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       What're you talkin' about?! C'mon,
                       don't be a first-class schmuck!

                       But we don't got the time to
                       infiltrate `em--
          
          Burt lets his temper flare; briefly, we SEE a more mature
          version of Bobby:
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Then we make the time!
                              (to Mike, Bobby)
                       Look, I want you all to understand
                       something--we don't ever play in
                       the dirt here, okay? Not ever, no
                       matter what!
                              (BEAT)
                       You piss in your pants, you only
                       stay warm for so long.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       What about callin' in the Feds?
                       They got a lot more juice than we
                       DO--
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Bunch of college boys from Kansas.
                       We protect our own here.
          
          Bobby sees an opening:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about
                       a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe
                       that's how you get to him.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       How you know about that, Bobby?
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (somewhat sheepish)
                       They been wanting me to buy in for
                       a while.
          
          Michael turns to the others.    Brightening:
          
                                       MICHAEL SOLO
                       Well, maybe that's it, then. If we
                       can get him--
                              (re: Bobby)
                       To set something up, maybe one of
                       our uncles could move in--
          
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                            (pointing to Bobby;
                             with some ridicule)
                     It'd have to be him--
          
                                    BURT GRUSINSKY
                     Forget it, both of you.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     What do you mean, set something up?
          
                                    BURT GRUSINSKY

                                    MICHAEL SOLO
                     You'd go set up a buy with `em,
                     just like they've been asking you
                     to. We follow you to the spot,
                     bust `em a week later. That way,
                     your name's clean, nobody knows
                     you're involved--
          
                                     BURT GRUSINSKY
                     That's too dangerous for him! We
                     don't know how solid his cover is
                     out there!
                            (to Bobby)
                     That girlfriend of yours, she knows
                     about you, right? So can we just
                     get back to the discussion please?
          
          A beat.   Bobby is dead serious:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     Pop?
          
                                    BURT GRUSINSKY
                     What?
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     You could trust her.
          
                                   BURT GRUSINSKY
                     Good. I'm glad. But it's not
                     happening. So forget it.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     But...but you could get killed--
          
                                    BURT GRUSINSKY
                     Don't worry about me, just worry
                     about yourself, arright? Anything
                     happens with your brother I'll call
                     you. Goodbye.

          A beat.   Bobby is still there, fixated.
          
                                    BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                     Goodbye!
          
          Finally, Bobby exits.   We GO TO:
          
          INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bobby enters his room, which is dark. Rosario is here,
          asleep. Her back to Bobby. Upon hearing him enter, she
          turns and looks at him (and US) in SLOW MOTION...
          
          Bobby sits on the edge of the bed, touches her back. She
          senses something wrong and speaks, voice ravaged by sleep:
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ
                     Everything okay?
                            (BEAT)
                     They said on the television your
                     brother was doing better.
          
          Bobby nods.
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
                     Me and my mother, we said a prayer
                     for him.
          
          Something seems to dawn on Bobby:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     Your mother's real important to
                     you, ain't she. You'd do anything
                     for her.
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ
                     Yeah, I guess...
          
          She looks at Bobby, who appears deep in thought:
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
                     You thinking about your brother?
                     About your family?
                            (BEAT)
                     There was nothing you could do...
          
          Bobby leans over, kisses her:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     Go back to sleep...
          
          He lies down next to her, still fully clothed.    Stares up

                       Bobby? It's all gonna work out...
                       You'll see...
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - RAINY DAY
          
          Burt and Jack and Michael. Burt is talking to the others
          in front of the hospital, but we are in WIDE SHOT, and we
          can't HEAR them. Burt shakes their hands, then walks
          inside. Mike and Jack walk in the opposite direction...
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT
          
          BOBBY stands inside an abandoned parking kiosk. (He's been
          watching from afar.) Jack and Mike approach their parked
          car. He tries to obscure himself partially inside the
          kiosk. They see him.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You been up to see my brother...?
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Yeah. Your father's still with him-
                       -we were just gonna go back to the
                       PSA. Try and figure out a tac plan
                       on Nezhinski.

                       ...How's that been goin'...?
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       We don't got much yet, but we'll do
                       our best.
                              (BEAT)
                       You all right?
          
          Bobby hesitates, then reveals himself completely:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Well I... I been thinking...if you
                       could keep it confidential...?
                              (BEAT)
                       I'd make the connection for you.

                       They trust me--we could go in
                       large, use my money for the buy,
                       they won't suspect anything--

                       It's too dangerous--you heard your
                       father.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (EMOTIONAL)
                       He don't gotta know anything about
                       it. Does he?
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       If anything went wrong, he'd never
                       forgive us.

                       I know.
                              (BEAT)
                       It's just--I realized...
                              (strains to utter)
                       ....my father dies `cause of all
                       this, I couldn't live my life
                       knowing I coulda done something.
                              (looks at both men)
                       I know the same is true for you.   I
                       know it is.
          
          ANGLE ON MICHAEL, JACK.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       So please--can we do this...?
          
          Jack, Michael turn to each other.    Then: ANGLE ON BOBBY.
          PRELAP a PHONE RINGING:
          
          INT. "HELLO" PHONE OFFICE
          
          A small office equipped with telephones, headsets, and fold
          out chairs. Lockers line the walls. Bobby's on the phone,
          waiting for someone to answer. REVEAL: Jack and Michael are
          here too, with HEADPHONES ON, LISTENING IN. Finally:
          
                                      ACCENTED VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
                       Hello?

                              (BEAT)
                       I decided--I wanna buy in.

                       How much we talkin' `bout here,
                       dude?
          
          Bobby looks to the cops.    They start mouthing something,
          but he ignores them:

                       Fifty k, to start.
          
          Mike and Jack's hairs stand on end upon hearing this.
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Oh, [the] man's gonna be good with
                       that. How `bout tomorrow night?
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Sounds good.
          
                                       PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Arright. We'll meet at El Caribe,
                       `round midnight?
                              (with a sly laugh)
                       That way, you could dance a little,
                       say hi to your girlfriend...
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Okay.   I'll see you tomorrow.
          
          Bobby hangs up.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Most expensive phone call I ever
                       made.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       We'll get it back for you.
          
          Jack reaches into a nearby LOCKER for something, then
          approaches Bobby and hands him a small BLACK BEEPER.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)
                       Now listen: from now on, you'll get
                       all your information through this,
                       at an undisclosed location. Your
                       contact with us is over after you
                       leave here.
          
          Bobby takes the BEEPER.     Michael touches his shoulder:
          
                                       MICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D)
                       Just be smart about things. Okay?
                       You get burnt and we gotta put you
                       in protection, it's still better
                       than winding up dead. An informant
                       dies, they talk about you for a
                       day. A week later, ain't no one

                              (BEAT)
                       Moral of the story is, don't die.

          ANGLE ON BOBBY as he sobers.   Nods.   Then:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You need to promise me something,
                    though. You won't investigate my
                    girlfriend--she's, she don't know
                    any better.
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    She won't be a target. Just make
                    sure she don't open her mouth.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I'll take care of it.
          
          Michael grabs Bobby's shoulder, a gesture of affection.
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    You know we known you your whole
                    life, kid? Good luck.
          
          INT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Bobby enters the bedroom. Presses his answering machine
          button, and a message begins to play. It is Rosario.
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ'S VOICE
                    Hi, Bobby. It's me. Just wanted
                    to see how you were doing--I guess
                    you're at the hospital now... I
                    hope your family's doing good...
                    Okay, I love you... Jumbo says
                    hello too...
          
          As her voice plays on the machine: he moves to the dresser,
          where he opens the top drawer. INSIDE: THOUSANDS OF
          DOLLARS--his SAVINGS. He begins to take the money out of
          the drawer and count it when: we HEAR a SOFT BUZZ. He
          quickly looks over, CHECKS THE BEEPER. He stares at the
          paged number...
          
          EXT. FLUSHING MEADOW PARK - FOGGY DUSK
          
          A MAN #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog. He
          is stocky, dressed in a down vest. Bobby enters the frame,
          trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment,
          then Bobby holds out the beeper. The man takes it.
          
          MAN #1 takes out A KEL DEVICE LISTENING UNIT and its
          accessories. Among them, a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. He UNSCREWS
          THE LIGHTER. Complex electronic innards.

                       Your wire's in here--we're gonna
                       follow the signal. Find the stash
                       house and make the deal, you leave
                       the rest to us.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You gonna leave me all alone out
                       there?

                       I ain't gonna lie to you.   There's
                       always a risk.
          
          Man #1 hands Bobby the LIGHTER.    He FIRES it.    It works.
          
                                      MAN #1 (CONT'D)
                       Your cover's blown, call for help--
                       don't try and be a hero. Just get
                       outta the way--place could turn
                       into a butcher shop. Talk about
                       pussy--that'll be our signal to
                       come in early.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You come up with that one all by
                       yourself?
          
                                       MAN #1
                              (ignores the joke)
                       Just do the deal and get out. Bear
                       in mind, your life is in that
                       lighter. Anything goes wrong, the
                       department'll get word to your
                       father.
          
          The Man unceremoniously turns to leave.     Then, suddenly:
          
                                      MAN #1 (CONT'D)
                       And oh--G.Q. told me to tell you--
                       your brother's coming along real
                       good. They reset his jaw and
                       sometimes he's awake.
          
          Bobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head. The
          man departs. Bobby grasps the lighter tight, looks at the
          man as he virtually disappears back into the fog...
          
          INT. CHURCH - EARLY EVENING
          
          It is an older Catholic church, a beautiful interior. A
          line of young Latino women hold candles, singing as they

          She lights a candle at the altar, then walking back to the
          pew, she SEES BOBBY and approaches. Bobby looks around,
          seeming harried and paranoid...
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby--what're you doing here?
          
          Bobby looks at her, his eyes filled with emotion.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I--I need to talk to you.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       I'm coming home in a little bit.
          
          He doesn't respond at all.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
                       Bobby?
          
          He appears almost in tears...    Finally, sotto:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I--I'm gonna inform. For the
                       police.
                              (BEAT)
                       I'm gonna help `em set up
                       Nezhinski.
          
          Rosario is shocked.     Almost inaudible:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       What...?
          
          As she steps back, he moves forward:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I had to do it, Rosario. These
                       motherfuckers--they were gonna come
                       after my father.
          
          Rosario tries to recover.    Can barely speak.     Sotto:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       But Nezhinski finds out, he'd kill
                       YOU--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       He ain't ever gonna find out.    He
                       ain't ever gonna know.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       But what if something goes wrong?
                       What's gonna happen to you?!?

                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I don't know... I'd, I'd probably
                    have to go into protection.
          
                                     ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Oh my God...
          
          Rosario breaks down, tears flowing.    Her hand to her mouth:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    But that's never gonna happen!
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    How could you not even talk to me
                    about it...?
          
          Bobby spins around to see if anyone's listening.      He pulls
          her into a dark corner of the church:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Rosario, listen--I had to do it.
          
          Bobby pulls her to him, holds her tight.    In her ear:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    I had to do it...
          
          Rosario is emotional.    Then:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    Everything's gonna be all right...
                    Don't worry, it'll be all right...
          
          Still fervid, she is silent.     CLUB MUSIC up...
          
          INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
          
          Bobby enters the place, determined. He has A BAG tucked
          under his arm. Many CLUBGOERS say hearty HELLOS to him.
          People are dancing, having a glorious time. LOUIS IS HERE,
          THRILLED to see Bobby. He HUGS him, effusive, heartfelt:
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Bobkes! My brother! I been
                    calling you all week! Where you
                    been?!? We missed you!!!
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Yeah... Sorry, buddy--I got some
                    legal shit to deal with, from the
                    raid... But I ain't forgot about
                    you--I'll be back soon.

                       Yeah well, without you around I
                       hadda lower myself here by hangin'
                       out with Freddie!
          
          Bobby gently pats his old friend's shoulder.       Interrupting
          this, Freddie steps in:
          
                                      FREDDIE
                       Bobby, hey! Mr. Buzhayev'd love to
                       see you, I'm sure--want me to tell
                       him you're here?
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       No, it's okay--I'll talk to him
                       later...
          
          He then walks by the COAT CHECK. He and ROSARIO see each
          other. He turns, SEES Pavel, in back. Pavel waves to
          Bobby, and Bobby starts walking to him.
          
          INT. BACK OF THE CLUB
          
          Bobby approaches a table, reserved for Pavel and the rest
          of the gang. Bobby joins them, with his bag.
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                       Where's Vadim.
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Oh, he don't come in here no more--
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (INTERRUPTING)
                       Well, I got fifty grand in here.
                       And it don't move `less I deal with
                       the man himself.
                              (BEAT)
                       So [if] you're interested, I wanna
                       see your stash, right now. No
                       bullshit.
          
          Pavel thinks a moment, eyes his cohorts.       Back to Bobby:
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Be on the boardwalk in a hour...
          
          Bobby turns to leave.    Pavel calls after him:
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)
                       And dude--this don't shake out...

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Pavel quickly draws his hand across his Adam's apple.
          Bobby exits, passing by ROSARIO as he does. She gives him
          a fearful look...
          
          EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT
          
          The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk. Bobby stands in the
          cold, waiting, holding his bag of money. Alone. Takes out
          the LIGHTER, the LISTENING DEVICE. He fires it--it works.
          Looks at his watch. In rummaging through his pockets for a
          smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number
          on it. He APPROACHES a nearby PHONE BOOTH. Bobby holds
          the paper in his hand, dials the number. A voice answers:
          
                                        MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
                       Hello?
          
          INT. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL - INTERCUT
          
          JOSEPH on the phone, in bed.      Nearby, Sandra is folding his
          blanket around him.
          
                                        JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Hello?
          
          EXT. BOARDWALK - INTERCUT
          
          Bobby says nothing.
          
                                        JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (PHONE FILTER)
                       Hello...?
          
          Bobby SEES Pavel's CAR DRIVE UP.      Bobby hangs up the phone.
          Takes a deep breath. We HEAR:
          
                                        PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       Dude!    Hey, dude!
          
          EXT. BOARDWALK STREET
          
          Bobby approaches the car. Pavel is in the back seat,
          calling to him with the window open.
          
                                        PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Get in!
          
          Bobby approaches the automobile. Pavel is in the back
          seat, calling to him with the window open. Another
          American sedan behind them. Bobby enters Pavel's.
          
          INT. LIVERY CAR
          
          Bobby takes the front passenger seat.      Pavel is behind him.
          Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car
          pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel
          over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE.
          Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay
          calm...
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Put your hands out, where I could
                       see `em.
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                       You know me.
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                       Shut your fuckin' mouth and do it!
          
          Bobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear
          view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel
          then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything
          incriminating. To the driver:
          
                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)
                       Turn at the light...
          
          The CAR makes A SHARP LEFT.      In Russian, subtitled:
          
                                        PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)
                       Go left.    Again.
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          The Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires
          screeching just slightly.
          
          INT. LIVERY CAR
          
          Pavel again:
          
                                       PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE
                       Let's go.   No one's on us.
          
          The camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY...
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange
          residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere.
          Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways
          up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns
          and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN
          IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car.
          They pull Bobby out:
          
                                                                68.
          
          
          
          INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY
          
          They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps.
          He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door.
          
          INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM
          
          Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The
          room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of
          money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL
          MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby
          surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask
          on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present,
          through the sequence.
          
          It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows
          are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is
          VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms
          are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES
          ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING
          MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.
          
          IN THE HALLWAY
          
          Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov
          rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head
          to Bobby. "FOLLOW ME," he seems to be saying.
          
          INT. BEDROOM
          
          Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a
          dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set
          up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them.
          There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic
          musical program silently unfolding.
          
          There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and
          two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly
          line for the preparation of narcotics.
          
          The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts
          counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown-
          Haired Man, puts up two fingers.
          
          On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then
          takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk,
          Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages
          of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall.
          
          This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man
          pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk
          blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING:
          TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS.

                                                                    69.
          CONTINUED:
          
          The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the
          SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo.
          
          He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop
          the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps
          from the package.
          
          Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and
          pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses
          two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY
          LETTER OPENER...
          
          The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another
          powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He
          continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move
          with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef
          on a cooking show.
          
          CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot.
          He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls
          down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY
          OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI'S VOICE
                       You needed to come here tonight...?
          
          Bobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN
          A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a
          surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him
          with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.
          
                                       VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       What's the matter, ain't Pavel good
                       enough for you?
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       That's all the money I got.    And I
                       ain't gonna leave it alone.
          
          The Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash:
          
                                         SLAVIC YOUTH
                       It's all there.     Fifty grand.
          
          Vadim points to the MONEY:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       Where'd you get this?
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       From my savings. From El Caribe
                       and Rasputin.

                           (nods; then:)
                    That buys you three keys in here.
                           (BEAT)
                    With the crack on the street, it's
                    worth two hundred k. Maybe more.
          
          Vadim walks over to a stack of green packages:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                    All the shit I get here is at least
                    eighty-six percent pure. And we
                    got a lot more comin' in--a LOT
                    more. In a way nobody could ever
                    trace.
          
          Vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards Bobby:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D)
                    The whole city'll be sucking our
                    glass soon--you'll see. We push
                    the Guineas out, the Domos'll work
                    for us.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    Sounds good.
          
          Vadim looks at that money again, takes a step forward.
          Bobby's forehead has beads of sweat. Vadim walks up close.
          Looks Bobby in the eye for a BEAT.
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    You're breathing heavy.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I took a little taste.
          
          Vadim puts his hand on Bobby's chest, checking his
          heartbeat.
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    You know, I seen fighters--they
                    breathe like that, means they get
                    nervous.
                           (BEAT)
                    You nervous?
          
          Bobby shakes his head. He is wired, out of it, but he
          pulls himself together. His jaw clenches. With fire, an
          edge of defiance:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    I'm clean.

          CONTINUED: (3)
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    You wanna search me again, you go
                    `head. I just wanna make this deal
                    and go home.
          
          Vadim violently pulls out Bobby's pockets. Out falls: a
          WALLET, SOME CHANGE, KEYS, A CIGARETTE LIGHTER, MATCHES.
          He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter. It
          fires. Bobby gets slightly edgy. Notices that the others
          congregate around the objects from his pocket--all except
          for Pavel, who holds an AK-47 trained on Bobby.
          
          Bobby inches ever closer to the rusted LETTER OPENER that
          the Brown-Haired Man had used to open a package of cocaine.
          Vadim puts down the lighter. And it occurs to him:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI
                    You got both matches and a lighter.
          
          Bobby realizes instantly that Vadim is right. Bobby
          shrugs, feigning innocence. He braces himself and decides
          to give the signal:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I'm gonna get pussy from this...
          
                                    PAVEL LUBYARSKY
                           (BEFUDDLED)
                    What you say...?
          
          Bobby looks around.   There's NO CAVALRY TO THE RESCUE.    He
          tries again:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    [When] this deal goes down, I'm,
                    I'm gonna get a lotta pussy...
          
          Still NOTHING. PAVEL'S attention turns to VADIM.   He moves
          toward NEZHINSKI, who:
          
          Starts FRANTICALLY POUNDING THE LIGHTER against the DESK.
          Trying break it open. Bobby scans the joint... The MEN
          are trained on that lighter, and this is his chance. He
          slips the LETTER OPENER into his hand.
          
          SEEMS LIKE WE CAN LITERALLY HEAR THE BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH
          BOBBY'S HEAD NOW. Setting himself, Bobby looks around the
          room--where's that backup???--and: the camera SPEEDS PAST
          Pavel's and Vadim's faces, to the other side of the room.
          It MOVES toward the WINDOW:
          
          VADIM HITS THE LIGHTER AGAIN. This time, it BREAKS OPEN.
          REVEALING A BEVY OF WIRES. It is CLEARLY NOT JUST A
          LIGHTER. The camera TILTS UP. VADIM IS ENRAGED:
          
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)

                    He got a wire!
                           (BEAT)
                    Kill this motherfucker, right now!
          
          IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S A GONER. PAVEL RAISES HIS GUN and
          CHARGES TOWARD BOBBY--ABOUT TO FIRE, when--
          
          THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. COPS EVERYWHERE. Mike and Jack lead
          the way, but there are what seems like tens of EMERGENCY
          SERVICES UNIT OFFICERS with them:
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    Hands on your heads! On the floor!
          
          NO ONE FREEZES. CHAOS. GUNFIRE. PAVEL SWINGS BACK TO
          BOBBY, a TERRIFYING LOOK ON HIS FACE. But Bobby is ready,
          and SHOVES THE LETTER OPENER INTO PAVEL'S NECK. BLOOD
          CASCADES DOWN THE MAN'S CHEST. Pavel collapses on Bobby,
          still very much alive. His eyes are popping, and he throws
          his hands around Bobby's THROAT. VADIM CHARGES INTO:
          
          INT. BACK ROOM
          
          Where he pulls up a SECTION OF LINOLEUM, REVEALING a TRAP
          DOOR that leads down to the apartment BELOW...
          
          INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
          
          HORRIFYINGLY--DRUG PEDDLERS, ARMED with all kinds of GUNS,
          POUR OUT from rooms everywhere--on the FIRST LEVEL of the
          building as well as the THIRD.
          
          AND EVERYONE COMES OUT FIRING.
          
          THE COPS ARE FORCED TO ENGAGE IN A FURIOUS GUN BATTLE, THE
          BULLETS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE. ABOVE AND BELOW.
          
          SEVERAL PUSHERS ARE HIT. THE POLICE have their gear and
          are reasonably protected, though TWO OF THEM ARE WOUNDED.
          
          Bullets SPLINTER the floor beneath their feet and the wall
          right above their heads. They have their backs to the wall
          as their only cover... PERCUSSION GRENADES THUNDER through
          the STRUCTURE...
          
          INT. BEDROOM
          
          A FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.   CONFUSION.
          
          BOBBY IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. STILL STRUGGLING WITH
          PAVEL, this has become the madness of war. Pavel bleeds
          profusely all over Bobby's chest, and this is a fight to
          the death.

          Bobby wrenches the LETTER OPENER out of Pavel's collarbone
          and desperately--and repeatedly--stabs Pavel in the base of
          the neck. Pavel's screams mix with gunfire to make a
          hell...
          
          AT THAT MOMENT: A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the top of Pavel's
          head clean off, spattering Bobby's face with brain
          particulate. Bobby is forced to get out from under... We
          HEAR POLICE SIRENS. RADIOS ON--

          VADIM slides down to the BACK ROOM in the APARTMENT BELOW.
          Panicked, he cocks his gun, searches for an escape route.
          
          INT. BEDROOM
          
          Bobby gets up, into a crouch, amidst the gunfire.    Dodging
          the bullets.
          
          An ESU Police Officer does not recognize Bobby as an ally,
          and he trains his assault rifle on Bobby. Bobby screams,
          his hands raised:
          
                                         BOBBY GREEN
                       I'm with you!     I'm with YOU!
          
          This is INAUDIBLE, with all the ammo being dispensed, and
          Bobby knows it; so he dodges the Officer; the Officer
          begins to unload his weapon, getting CLOSER to BOBBY.
          
          AND CLOSER.
          
          AND CLOSER.     Bobby is about to be killed when:
          
          HE SEES HIS CHANCE. HE CHARGES BACKWARD. WITH FEROCIOUS
          DETERMINATION, HE THROWS HIMSELF OUT A NEARBY WINDOW.
          
          THE PANE SHATTERS. BOBBY TUMBLES THROUGH, HIS FACE AND
          BODY RIDDLED WITH SHARDS OF GLASS.
          
          EXT. TENEMENT
          
          Bobby FALLS roughly twenty feet through the air. His body
          tumbles upside-down, toward a wrought-iron FENCE that
          surrounds the base of the apartment building's side.
          
          Bobby HITS the FENCE. His LEG GETS CAUGHT on one of the
          small spikes. He SCREAMS as we GO BACK TO:
          
                                                                   74.

          Cop cars pull up by the dozen, from EVERYWHERE. Out of one

                    Don't shoot!
          
          Officers pour in, among them BURT. Cops forcefully push
          Vadim to the ground. Start to cuff him. Burt pulls Jack
          ASIDE:
          
                                   BURT GRUSINSKY
                    Where's my goddamned kid?!?
          
          Jack is speechless--he doesn't know. (We SEE that Burt's
          question--revealing Bobby's identity--REGISTERS on VADIM'S
          FACE.) Vadim mutters, aloud but sotto, in Russian:
          
                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
                    He is a dead man...
          
                                    OFFICERS
                           (not comprehending)
                    Shut up! Get down!
          
          Burt frantically PUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD OF COPS...
          
          EXT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY
          
          Bobby is upside-down, hanging from the fence, but he is
          alert. Two members of the EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT approach
          him.
          
          On sheer instinct alone, he starts to PULL his LEG off the
          small SPIKE, his teeth clenched. An ARMY of ESU TROOPS and
          PARAMEDICS come to BOBBY'S AID...

          BOBBY is being lowered from the fence. An AMBULANCE ZOOMS
          UP the STREET, to the alley. Burt rushes to his son.
          Jack and Mike come right behind him. Bobby looks at his
          father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass.
          Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's
          gaze.
          
                                        BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Jesus.

                       He's gonna be okay, Chief.
                              (to others)
                       Clear out!
          
          Burt eases when he hears this. They move Bobby toward the
          ambulance. Burt turns to Michael. Sotto:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       You guys go on a bust like this and
                       you don't tell me about it? You
                       think I'm born yesterday?
          
                                        MICHAEL SOLO
                       I guess we do.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       You're a real comedian! He's gonna
                       need to be in protection now!
          
          INT. AMBULANCE
          
          Bobby sits up on the stretcher as a MEDIC treats his leg.
          Burt approaches, watches for a moment. The Medic leaves
          the post for a moment, and the two are ALONE. Burt stares
          at his son, who finally speaks:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I'll be all right, Pop.
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                              (shakes head; then:)
                       Well, I guess I don't have a say in
                       anything anymore. Anyway... You
                       did it. You did it and it took
                       real balls.
                              (BEAT)
                       But now you're burnt--and we gotta
                       get you someplace safe, keep you
                       under wraps for awhile.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I need you to get my girlfriend,
                       Pop. I need her to come with me.
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Burt is getting emotional, aware of how close his son came
          to death. Trying not to show it--and failing.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       I'll get them to take care of that.
                       Just go get yourself fixed up--
                       that's the most important thing.
          
          With that, the Medic returns, and with a heavy heart, Burt
          closes the ambulance door. Bobby is alone with the Medic
          for a moment in the back of the vehicle; he watches through
          the window as his father walks to his car. Bobby sinks to
          the cot, lies down. AS VADIM NEZHINSKI is LED AWAY in
          HANDCUFFS...

          A LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL: the STORY is about the BUST: MAJOR
          NARCOTICS SEIZURE, 40 KILOS OF COCAINE. An OFFICER is
          KILLED; Two PERPETRATORS (among them: PAVEL and the SLAVIC
          MAN) KILLED. Four others wounded.
          
          MORE THAN A DOZEN ARRESTS. We SEE the PERPS, lined up
          against the walls. VADIM NEZHINSKI'S MUG SHOT. We're told
          he's AWAITING TRIAL. In a RELATED STORY--

          EXT. JOSEPH'S BLOCK - SUNNY DAY
          
          Several POLICE CARS line the block. There are ARMED
          OFFICERS perched on rooftops. As PROTECTION. Many of the
          houses have "WELCOME HOME" banners hanging from them. The
          media are here. NEIGHBORS are on their porches.
          
          INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM
          
          Packed with people and playing CHILDREN. Lively. Food
          everywhere. TWO ARMED GUARDS stand against the wall. A
          CROWD surrounds someone. Then, as the CAMERA DOLLIES
          CLOSER, people move away to reveal: BOBBY, seated in a
          chair against the wall. His leg is bandaged. AD-LIB
          friendly HELLOS from partygoers, who surround him and treat
          him respectfully. PAN OVER TO REVEAL: ROSARIO, seated next
          to him. She sits quietly; his arm is around her shoulder.
          People are STARING AT HER.

          SPIRO GIAVANNIS (we saw him at our film's beginning--he's
          the Deputy Commissioner and he's in uniform) shakes Bobby's
          hand enthusiastically. He uses his hands to cup Bobby's:
          
                                      SPIRO GIAVANNIS
                       Bobby, hi! Spiro Giavannis, Deputy
                       Commissioner. Glad to see you made
                       it out here today!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Yeah. They let me come--long as I
                       brought these guys with me.
          
          Bobby points to the ARMED GUARDS next to him.

                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Good... It's rehabbing good, for
                       only nine weeks.
                              (SHRUGS)

          LAUGHTER from others.    Bobby's expression changes, sobers.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Anyway, it ain't nothing compared
                       to my brother, so...
          
          AD-LIBBED AGREEMENT from others.    A FAT LADY peeks her head
          in, calls out:

                       minute!
          
          A RUSH toward the door.    Rosario leans in to Bobby:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby, I'm gonna go outside for a

                       I'm not sure yet... We been
                       thinking about moving down to
                       Miami. Guy I used to work for, his
                       brother's got a place down there.
          
                                      SPIRO GIAVANNIS
                       Gee, that's great. Well listen,
                       you need any help, you give us a
                       call. `Cause we can be part of
                       your family too.
          
          He gives Bobby his BUSINESS CARD. Bobby takes it, mutters
          a "thank you." Spiro pats him on the shoulder, leaves.
          Bobby turns to Rosario, knowing she's somewhat out of place
          here. Children run by, having fun. Bobby eyes them, then
          he leans closer. Sotto, tender:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       A lotta kids here, lotta family...
                       It's nice, ain't it...?
          
          She nods.    Whispered:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       You know how happy I am you're with
                       me?
          
                                        ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Yes...
          
          He leans over, kisses her.
          
          INT. FOYER
          
          A RANDOM WOMAN, who'd been looking out the window, turns
          back toward the house. With a huge smile on her face:
          
                                        RANDOM WOMAN
                       Here they are!
          
          INT. DINING ROOM
          
          Bobby brightens, begins to stand with only a little
          difficulty as he anticipates Joseph's entrance. As this
          happens, Rosario slips out from under his grasp:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       `Be right back...
          
          And she walks off.    Bobby watches as she enters:
          
                                                                   79.
          
          
          
          INT. BATHROOM
          
          Rosario closes the door on Bobby, turns on the running
          water. Then begins to rummage through her purse. Finds a
          small vial of cocaine inside. Takes it out, opens it, but
          DROPS IT IN THE SINK. The drug spills into the water,
          washing it down the drain. Frantically, she tries to
          finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain...
          
          INT. FOYER
          
          ENTERING THE HOUSE: JOSEPH and Sandra, his wife. Joe holds
          two bags--one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other
          with clothes. What seems like a ZILLION PEOPLE are here
          when he walks in. Everyone CHEERS. BURT moves right
          behind him, all smiles. Joseph is thrilled--but somehow
          not the same. His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a
          different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive
          surgery on his jaw. There is, of course, a scar, and he's
          lost a lot of weight.
          
          Behind him, Burt waves everyone closer. Jack and Mike and
          other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand
          back, all smiles. AD-LIB HELLOS. An elderly NEIGHBOR
          comes forward, giddy:
          
                                       NEIGHBOR
                       Wow, fella! You look great!
                              (pointing to his own
                               EYE)
                       Your eye--does it hurt?
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Only when I look at you!
          
          LAUGHTER. Then Joseph FREEZES. He NOTICES: BOBBY, next to
          the ARMED MEN who haven't left his side.
          
          The two brothers make eye contact. The crowd quiets a bit.
          Bobby smiles at the sight of his brother. Joseph gets
          emotional, too:
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Hey, Bobby...
          
          Without a word, Bobby nods, moves to his brother. As Burt
          looks on, pleased, Bobby takes his hand and grips the back
          of Joseph's neck. Joseph pulls his brother to him by his
          neck. A real embrace. Joseph pats Bobby's back.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I'm real glad you're home...
          
          The two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment:
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                     80.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      SANDRA GRUSINSKY
                       Everyone, let's, let's move inside--
                       there's plenty to eat!
          
          Soft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates,
          moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Joseph--we got some things we need
                       to discuss, when you get the
                       chance.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       We could do it now if you want,
                       Pop. In the den.
          
          Burt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den--
          except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She
          approaches him.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the
                       motel.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       What're you talking about? They
                       got a lot of food over there--why
                       don't you go eat something?
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                              (shakes her head)
                       N--I'm gonna go back.
          
          A beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks
          into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question:
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (WHISPERED)
                       You fucked up?
          
          A muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial.
          Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his
          head out:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Bobby--you should hear this too,
                       for the trial.
          
          Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den.       Back to Rosario:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       We gotta straighten this out later.
          
          Bobby then moves to the den.
          
                                                                       81.
          
          
          
          INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN
          
          Burt and Joseph and Jack and Mike.    Bobby enters the room.
          As he does, we HEAR:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Nezhinski's cache was huge, about
                       40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       We're gonna try and turn him, get
                       him to tell us how they're bringing
                       it in. But don't worry--we'll make
                       sure he does plenty of time.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop.
          
          Bobby closes the door behind him softly.       Joseph sees
          Bobby, is surprised he's here...
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Well, you marry an ape, you don't
                       complain about the stench of
                       bananas.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Where is he?
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice
                       and comfy. We're taking him to the
                       A.D.A. next week, for a meeting.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       I wanna go with you on that. See
                       his fuckin' face.
          
          Jack nods.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       I'll tell you, though--streets're
                       dead. Junkies're waitin' out there
                       for something big, no question.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       That's `cause we got their number
                       one. Dried it up at the source.
          
          All of a sudden, a VOICE from behind:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       That don't mean nothing.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 82.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Everyone turns around, slightly surprised Bobby's opened
          his mouth here:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       What's that, Bobby?
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       There's a whole network full of
                       suppliers. The organization goes
                       deep.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Bobby--you done a lot for us
                       already. You don't gotta get
                       involved in this anymore. Okay?
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       I asked him to come in, Joe. If
                       he's gonna have to testify, he
                       should know all this.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       This's police business, Pop--you
                       gonna make him an honorary member
                       of the Force now?
          
          An ugly beat.    Then:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I'll be outside if you need me.
          
          Bobby exits, and Burt watches him depart.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM
          
          The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run
          around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt
          comes up next to him, takes him into a corner:
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                       BOBBY--
                              (SOTTO)
                       What was said in there, he--he
                       didn't mean it.
          
          Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his
          father's words. Then:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Well, why's he goin' back to work
                       so soon, anyway? He ain't ready.
          
          
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 83.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       No--it's better this way. I don't
                       want him sitting around with
                       nothing to do, feeling useless--
          
          Bobby is about to leave.     Burt stops him:
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Hey, c'mere.
                              (Bobby returns)
                       A lotta people been talking. About
                       how good you did.
                              (BEAT)
                       And I think maybe...considering the
                       alternatives...
                              (BEAT)
                       ...maybe you might wanna think
                       about joining the Department.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       POP--
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       I could pull some strings, get you
                       through the academy with an early
                       LEAVE--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       No, come on! I don't want that!
                              (BEAT)
                       What I did, I did for you guys,
                       this once. I got my own plans.
          
          Bobby motions to his bodyguard. Burt senses he's said the
          wrong thing. Gently tries to stop him:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Wait--Don't go yet--
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (to the Guard)
                       Take me back to the motel.
          
          With that, Bobby leaves with his bodyguard. Burt stands
          there for a moment, frustrated. TEDDY, his grandson, runs
          past him. Naked. Sandra follows the boy. Burt turns to
          see the naked youngster, then to Sandra:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Can't you put some clothes on him?
          
                                                                 84.
          
          
          
          EXT. METS MOTEL - EARLY EVENING
          
          It's a cheesy hotel on Queens Boulevard. TWO UNMARKED CARS
          pull up. Armed Guards exit the autos first, casing the
          area. They're followed by Bobby.
          
          INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY
          
          Bobby approaches his room. A Guard, we'll call him VITT,
          is outside the room holding his shotgun. Nods a "hello".
          Bobby moves past him, opens the door. The ROOM is EMPTY.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                     Rosario?    Rosario!
          
          A beat.   Then Bobby spins around, furious:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                     WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!?
          
          INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
          
          A number of PEOPLE are HERE. It's PACKED. We are on the
          DANCE FLOOR. MUSIC: GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES".
          ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing
          up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many
          would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and
          stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free.
          As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All,
          of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with
          two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful.
          
          ALL OF A SUDDEN: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY. When
          Louis sees his friend, he lights up. Bobby's furious
          inside, but strangely calm outside:
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                     Bobkes!!!
          
          Bobby GLARES at Rosario. He takes her arm, starts to walk
          her out. She tries to pull Bobby toward the dancing:
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ
                     C'mon, honey--let's dance!
          
                                     BOBBY GREEN
                     The cops're right outside--let's
                     go.
                            (beat; louder)
                     I said, let's go!

                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                       You don't gotta yell at me, Bobby.
                              (starts to move to
                               DOOR)
                       ...[I] was just trying to have a
                       little fun for once, that's all...
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Lou--no more of this for her.   It's
                       too fuckin' dangerous now.
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI
                              (SINCERE)
                       Sure, Bobkes. I mean, she come
                       here.
          
          Bobby grabs Rosario by the elbow.     She yanks it away:
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Wait!   Lemme get my coat at least!
          
          Rosario moves toward the coat check, and Bobby follows.      As
          he does, Louis walks with him:
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       You know Bob, everyone's been
                       askin' `bout you. We was all real
                       surprised to hear about your family-
                       -I mean, your father's like J.
                       Edgar Hoover--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll
                       call you. But right now I need to
                       get her outta here.
          
          Louis nods, understanding.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE THE EL CARIBE
          
          Rosario leads Bobby back toward the ESCORT CAR.      He leans
          forward, grabs her arm. Sotto but intense:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You gotta put everything in
                       jeopardy? Huh?
          
                                     ROSARIO DIAZ
                       No! I was just dancing! I didn't
                       say nothing!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You know, I don't think you realize
                       how serious this is?

                       We gotta ride this out, `til this
                       fuckin' thing is over. `Til I can

          Looking down at the ground, she exhales. Hits the side of
          a nearby car gently with the palm of her hand, frustrated.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby, what do you want from me? I
                       can't go out, I can't do nothing--
                       it's like I'm in a jail--
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       I know. But I'm workin' on it, I
                       am.
                              (looks around; then)
                       Soon as the trial's over and I get
                       my money back outta impound--
                       everything'll get better, you'll
                       see.
          
          She gets emotional.    Shrugs:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       It's just, I feel...I feel like
                       it's just you and all those cops
                       all the time. And they look at me
                       like I'm a piece of shit.
          
          Bobby tries to comfort her, reaches out to her arm.      As
          tears come out of her eyes:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Rosario--once this's done, we'll go
                       down to Miami... [It'll] be a new
                       thing for us--a lotta
                       opportunities...
                              (BEAT)
                       I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about
                       working for his brother down there.
                       We'll get your mother to come too--
                       I'll even talk to Jumbo about it.
          
          Slight comfort. She nods. Bobby leans over, kisses her.
          He tenderly puts his hand on her face. She kisses his
          hand. Their GUARDS are WATCHING. She smiles, and that
          love returns:

          Vadim Nezhinski is being led, in handcuffs, into an
          unmarked Chevy. Both JOSEPH and Jack are here. Joseph and
          Vadim exchange looks as Vadim is placed into the back seat.
          Joe's expression is pure suppressed rage...
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                     I'll go in the lead car. You stay
                     with him `til we get to the

          Joseph gets in his lead car, also an unmarked Chevy.    Both

          We SEE Bobby's ARMED GUARDS waiting on the steps.    TILT UP
          TO the closed door. Over this, we HEAR:
          
                                    MARAT BUZHAYEV (O.S.)
                     We heard all about you in the news.
                     We were all very sorry about your
                     brother.
          
          INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - RAINY DAY
          
          Bobby and Marat Buzhayev, inside the living room.   Bobby
          sits down, on the couch's armrest; Marat is in an easy
          chair, his lunch being served on a T.V. tray in front of
          him by his wife Kalina. The television plays a Russian
          movie, and Marat seasons his food.
          
                                     BOBBY GREEN
                     Thank you... You know Mr.
                     Buzhayev, I come to see you today
                     `cause...with everything that's
                     gone on, I don't think it's a good
                     idea for me to stay in New York
                     anymore. I was hoping maybe you
                     could ask your brother if I could
                     work with him, down in Miami. On
                     his restaurant.
          
                                    MARAT BUZHAYEV
                     I could talk to him. I think he
                     would like you very much.

          Marat turns to Bobby, puts his hand on his knee. Emotional:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       We're going to be very sad if
                       you're going. Having you here in
                       this house meant a lot to us. You
                       know, my wife and me, we have only
                       daughters.

                              (checks his watch)
                       I should probably go now.

                       back here.

          The car is moving. Jack is driving. Another cop is in the
          front passenger seat. Two other cops straddle Vadim.
          Silence, then, motioning toward Joseph's car:
          
                                        VADIM NEZHINSKI

          A VAN CROSSES THE LINE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. COMES RIGHT
          TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO PASSENGER'S SIDE. EXPLOSIVE. A
          THUNDERING SOUND, GLASS EVERYWHERE. THE COP IN THE
          PASSENGER'S SEAT FLIES RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.
          He's probably killed.

                       Stop the fuckin' car!
          
          As Joseph PULLS OUT HIS GUN, READYING HIMSELF TO DO BATTLE,
          ANOTHER CAR PULLS IN BETWEEN THEM. AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE
          immediately pins Joseph and the other two police inside the
          vehicle.
          
          INT. VADIM'S COP CAR
          
          THREE MEN IN SKI MASKS emerge from the van, automatic
          WEAPONS IN HAND. JACK PULLS OUT HIS PIECE and immediately
          begins firing at them, using the wheel and dashboard as
          cover. He opens his door to slink out.
          
          VADIM HITS THE FLOOR.
          
          The other two officers are immediately riddled with
          GUNFIRE.
          
          Two of the men PULL VADIM toward them. The third man in a
          ski mask is hit by Jack's fire, but has just enough
          adrenaline to get into the SECOND CAR.
          
          IT SPEEDS AWAY.

          Burt hangs up, grabs his jacket--which had been draped over
          the kitchen chair. Burt bolts out of the house...

                       Yeah, maybe. Why don't we give `em
                       all these bags to throw out--it's
                       becoming a mess.
          
          A KNOCK. BURT BARGES IN. Rosario stands. Other Cops come
          through the door as well, beginning a move.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       What's goin' on?
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Nezhinski's out.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       What--?
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Your brother was taking him to the
                       A.D.A. and they got ambushed. They
                       hit three of our guys.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Jesus...   What about--
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Your brother's fine. We gotta get
                       you moved--you've been here too
                       long.
          
          Bobby looks to Rosario, who's in shock.      Burt looks to her:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       You need to pack up.

          The two start packing...
          
          EXT. MOTEL FRONT - RAINY DAY
          
          Our characters are leaving the hotel, bags and all. The
          RAIN comes down in SHEETS. They pause under the awning,
          waiting for the cars to be brought close. Burt stands
          under the awning, looking out at houses beyond the parking
          lot. Rosario is rummaging through her suitcase as Bobby
          stands nearby. Vitt approaches Burt:
          
                                      VITT THE GUARD
                       Chief, we got three vehicles coming
                       around the corner. Backup's on the
                       way.
          
          Burt nods, Vitt runs off. The sound of RAIN. Bobby is
          putting his BULLETPROOF VEST on, SEES Burt STARING OUT.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You see something out there?
          
          Burt shakes his head, moves to help with the vest:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Nah, we're good. It's just, I just
                       realized--I know this neighborhood.
                       I used to come with my father, to
                       work on the plumbing, for the
                       houses--brought me along to do the
                       talking. He only spoke Russian his
                       whole life...
                              (BEAT)
                       Anyway, it's all changed now.
          
          A GUARD approaches:
          
                                      GUARD
                       One more minute, Chief.
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Arright...
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Pop?   Joe come close this morning?
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       I don't know... I heard he did
                       good, though. You know, with
                       everything that's happened--who
                       knows? Maybe all this'll bring us
                       closer together someday.

                       Once this is over, you and your
                       brother, you'll talk, you'll work
                       things out.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Yeah, maybe.   But you know the way
                       he is.
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY
                       Bobby--your brother, I think he
                       probably feels a little guilty,
                       with everything you did, with you
                       in protection now... But he
                       appreciates what you've done--I
                       know he does.
          
          Rosario is right behind them, listening. When Burt stares
          at her, she averts his gaze. Burt changes course:
          
                                      BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       Look, I'm just trying to keep us
                       together here, that's all. That's
                       all I want.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (relents a bit; nods)
                       I know, Pop.
          
          Burt warms slightly, too. A beat, then the CARS PULL UP.
          Bobby looks at his father with real feeling. Burt eyes
          him, then touches Bobby's cheek, a truly loving gesture:
          
                                       BURT GRUSINSKY
                              (almost to himself)
                       Okay...
                              (to an officer)
                       We'll move `em to Corona. I'll
                       lead the line.
          
          Bobby takes Rosario's hand as we GO TO:
          
          EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT
          
          THREE CARS: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind him is
          Bobby and Rosario's car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel
          and the two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO
          OFFICERS in it. That vehicle trails the other two. The
          CARS DRIVE OFF.
          
          NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY
          SUBJECTIVE WAY, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION
          AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD.
          
                                                                93.
          
          
          
          INT. BOBBY'S CAR
          
          Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through
          her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view
          through the windshield of his father's car.
          
          Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN
          is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the
          windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water
          on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible.
          
          The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic
          is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP
          of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR
          the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the
          wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around
          Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     It's really coming down...
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ
                     Bobby--I think I left my watch at
                     the hotel--
          
          Bobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving
          alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way
          it's moving...
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                     Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on
                     our right!
          
                                       VITT THE GUARD
                              (TURNING)
                     Huh--?
          
          A FLASH!
          
          CRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't
          HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of
          nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle...
          VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing
          cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes
          her head down, into the back seat.
          
          THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to
          the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt
          to the side. To Rosario:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                     Get down!
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                      94.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Rosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her
          hands. THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers
          REVEALING: BURT'S CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH
          OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP--we don't know from
          which car it's been dislodged...
          
          COMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT BOBBY'S WINDSHIELD.
          Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves.
          THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes
          up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that
          protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred
          feet below.
          
          Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR--
          behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting
          Bobby's car...
          
          THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR.      BOBBY SEES the
          barrel of the gun swing to Burt.
          
          ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The
          water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's
          car has shattered.
          
          Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping
          open. He CAN SEE:
          
          HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS.
          We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL:
          
                                      BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER)
                       They got a hit on! Get support,
                       now!
          
          Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries
          to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the
          car, one driving and one doing the shooting--
          
          BOOM!   And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear
          door.   Rosario is JOLTED--screams again...
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Rosario!   You hurt?
          
          She shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl.
          She's hysterical--but physically unharmed.
          
          The traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible,
          blinding. Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car,
          wrecking visibility. We ARE ON: the B.Q.E., with many
          trucks, big and small, on it.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
          The Olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many
          large semis. BOBBY WATCHES AS: Burt's car is right behind
          the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous.
          
          A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it
          before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's
          car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering
          and keeping up the pursuit.
          
          POLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT...
          
          The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT
          JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's
          slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND.
          
          BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific
          accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is
          TERRIBLE:
          
          The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping
          over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people
          inside.
          
          The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway
          toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and
          the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt.
          Into the radio:
          
                                     BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    Pop, lay back!
          
          But Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man
          in the back seat. HE FIRES.
          
          A HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile.
          The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR:
          
                                    BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER)
                    I got him!   I got the sonofabitch!
          
          AND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND
          CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG
          SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear
          passenger's seat area.
          
          His eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP.    THE BARREL OF THE
          SHOTGUN turns:
          
          WATER covers the windshield, BLINDING the driver (and us).
          The water slides off the glass.
          
          THEN: A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP.

          BOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURT'S FACE. He's been HIT.
          He loses control of the automobile... Bobby freezes, IN
          DISBELIEF. IN HORROR. HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT...
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school
          children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner.
          
          Bobby's car peels off, away from danger. Burt's car IS
          HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. In what seems like his dazed last
          gasp, he SLAMS on the BRAKES. The car skids out, spins.
          The motion is DIZZYING...
          
          THE OLDS is uncontrolled. The vehicle moves through a
          traffic light, HITTING another car.
          
          STARTS TUMBLING, NOT ON ITS SIDE, BUT HEAD OVER TAIL.
          
          It is one intense image. The car is upside down now. It
          slides for tens of feet before stopping. Smoldering...
          
          The rain falls, making an oddly serene sound.   We HEAR
          SIRENS. The Police are approaching.
          
          Burt's car stops slowly. He gets out of the car, his face
          a mess. He stumbles for a few feet in the rain. BOBBY'S
          CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE...
          
          BURT'S EYES ARE RED, filling with blood. His JAW is open.
          He gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. His body
          spasms. Then he collapses, on his knees. FALLS. FACE
          DOWN. IN A POOL OF BLOOD. The Police are in the
          background...
          
          WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER, WHO IS
          LYING ON THE STREET. Bobby bends down, turning his father
          over. His father's blood is all over his hands now.
          
          Burt is dead.
          
          Other cops surround them. Bobby looks up at all of them,
          they at him. Broken, he pushes the others away. As water
          drips off his face:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Don't fuckin' look at him! I said
                    don't--back up! Don't look at
                    him...
          
          
          
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                      97.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Bobby eyes his father, spent, crestfallen--but not
          histrionic. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN. The BLOOD from BURT'S
          BODY flows into the street, along the curb,into the gutter.
          
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bobby and Rosario, outside an office. Armed cops are up
          and down the hall. We HEAR conversation through the walls.
          Bobby is standing, smoking a cigarette, holding back tears.
          Rosario is seated on a nearby bench--wet, shivering,
          stunned. Rosario looks to Bobby:
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby?   Could I call my mother...?
          
          Speechless, Bobby nods.     Jack emerges from the office,
          approaches Michael:
          
                                       JACK SHAPIRO
                       No I.D. on the guys in the car.
                       Probably illegals. But Mike--
                              (pulls M. closer)
                       --We had that place locked up
                       tight. How they knew where they
                       were, I go no idea.
          
                                       MICHAEL SOLO
                              (turns to Bobby)
                       We gotta get you to a secure
                       location, Bobby--
          
          Bobby, emotional and glassy-eyed, interrupts:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Does my brother know yet?
          
                                       MICHAEL SOLO
                              (beat; then:)
                       He's taking it very hard.
                              (BEAT)
                       They had to sedate him.
          
          These words hit Bobby.     His eyes close, forcing tears down
          his cheeks.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Then you gotta take me to him...
                              (SOTTO)
                       I wanna go see him...
          
          Michael turns to an OFFICER, motions. The officer leaves.
          The camera DOLLIES INTO a CLOSE SHOT of Bobby and we GO TO:
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          
          INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN
          
          Sitting on the couch is Joseph. He is trying to be stoic,
          but appears wan and tired. Alone. We HEAR the crowd in
          the house, but they are in the living room. A KNOCK: Bobby
          enters.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                    Joseph?
          
          Joseph eyes him, seems heartened by the sight of his
          brother. But he is out of it, emotionally bludgeoned:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    ...I'll catch `em, Bobby. Don't
                    worry...
          
          Bobby walks over to Joseph, stands close to him.   Searches
          for words. Before he can speak:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                    They're gonna need us to identify
                    the body...
          
          Then, as emotional as we've yet seen him, Bobby strains to
          get the sentences out of his mouth:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I don't know if I can do that.   I
                    MEAN--
                           (BEAT)
                    I saw him die...
          
          Bobby breaks down. Joseph responds by CLUTCHING him
          tightly. The brothers rock back and forth gently.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    I wanna stay close to you from now
                    on, Joe...
                           (into J's ear)
                    I wanna stay with you...
          
          INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
          
          The shot is of a small and bare room in a Queens funeral
          home. In the center is a COFFIN. The camera DOLLIES
          TOWARD IT. Entering the room is an UNDERTAKER, with Bobby
          and Joseph right behind.
          
                                   UNDERTAKER
                    We know mere words cannot suffice
                    in this time of tragedy. We're so
                    very sorry about your loss...
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          The Undertaker unhinges the coffin. Inside is Burt, eyes
          closed, clothed in a suit. We don't see the body; what we
          DO see are the reactions of his two sons. Bobby's grief is
          obvious, but he's already seen him dead. This is new
          territory for Joseph, who though he does not break down,
          seems overwhelmed. Both young men nod in acknowledgement,
          and the Undertaker closes the coffin.
          
                                      UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)
                       Now I'm told you're going to be
                       handling the arrangements for
                       tomorrow's service--?
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                              (DEVASTATED)
                       That's right...
          
                                       UNDERTAKER
                       Could you come with me please?
                              (to Bobby)
                       We'll be right back.
          
          As the Undertaker leads Joseph away, Bobby enters an:
          
          INT. ANTECHAMBER
          
          Where waiting are Jack and Michael. Bobby gives a fiery
          stare to the two cops. He approaches them. Sotto but
          intense, his teeth clenched in a simmering anger:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You gonna fuckin' catch these guys?
          
          A nod.   Bobby senses uncertainty:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       You ain't got nothing, do you.
          
          Michael looks to Jack, who steps forward:
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       All our uncles on the street been
                       hearing about a big deal, goin'
                       down maybe Monday or Tuesday.
                              (BEAT)
                       They don't know where yet, but...we
                       got a feeling--[now that]
                       Nezhinski's out, he's gonna be
                       there.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (growing emotional)
                       You gotta find that spot...

                       You and your brother don't gotta
                       worry about any of that. Just take
                       the time you need--

                       MIKE--
          
          The men all turn around.    Joseph stands there, wounded but
          COMMITTED:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       I'll be ready to come back and head
                       it up. I'll be ready and, and
                       we'll get `em.
                              (BEAT)
                       After the funeral.
          
          Joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin. Bobby
          WATCHES him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of
          the casket. We HEAR:
          
          BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
          
          EXT. INTERBORO CEMETERY - DAY
          
          A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of
          tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both
          wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the
          children get out behind them and are led away by funeral
          coordinators to another place in the coming processional.
          In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars
          move toward the two brothers.
          
          The Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic.
          Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting:
          
                                     JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Bobby... I'm real glad you're with
                       me now...
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Course...
          
          Joseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses.    Leans
          to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       You know, I was...I was jealous of
                       you, [for a] long time.
          
          Bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken
          aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment.
          Joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking:
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)
                       ...I always did what Pop wanted.
                       And you were free...
          
          Bobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       No.... I did it to hurt him...   I
                       disappointed him...
          
          Interrupting the moment, the Undertaker approaches:
          
                                      UNDERTAKER
                       Gentlemen?
          
          The Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession.
          Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME, we GO TO:
          
          MINUTES LATER.
          
          A line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE.
          The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline
          is in the distance.
          
          UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is
          removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the
          gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE:
          
          BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...
          
          People get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize
          from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of
          the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and
          his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA.
          
          The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.
          
          Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and
          file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is
          here too, though several rows back. She is with the women.
          
          Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds
          of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT:
          
          LOUIS FALSETTI.
          
          At that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make
          EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and
          nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and
          sympathetic smile coming across his face...
          
          SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more
          distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him
          and does.

          Several WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help, and then, trying to
          recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for
          support. Tries to straighten:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    ...It's all right... I'll be all
                    right...
          
          Bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is
          momentarily rendered speechless. He tightens his own grasp
          around Joseph, leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN.
          
          FURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL
          
          Rosario. Walking. Eyeing the Cops, the Cop Wives. She
          does not fit in. Cops are staring at her. She SEES COP
          WIVES looking at her, leaning over to each other and
          TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're
          saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy...
          
          Rosario quickens her pace away from them, and the MARCH
          MOVES ON...
          
          EXT. GRAVESITE
          
          The line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the
          coffin, which is in the ground. BOBBY and JOSEPH silently
          lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. Rosario moves
          behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS:
          TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at
          the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby.
          
          A beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied.
          Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I can't live like this no more,
                    Mike... They destroyed my family.
                           (BEAT)
                    There's a deal going down, I... I
                    wanna help...
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    You're a civilian, Bobby. Ain't no
                    way.
          
          Bobby leans closer, more focused:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I, I could join you.
          
          Michael turns to him, surprised.
          
          
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  103.

                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       My Pop tol' me you pull guys outta
                       the Academy, guys with special
                       knowledge, [and] make `em cops?
                       You could do that.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Bobby, come on--you got your own
                       life to live--
          
                                        BOBBY GREEN
                               (INTERRUPTING)
                       No.   I can't do nothing else now.
          
          A beat, as Mike ponders.     Then:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Then you gotta understand--this
                       ain't something you do just for a
                       vendetta. You gotta go back to the
                       Academy when you're done, you gotta
                       commit yourself.
          
          Bobby looks at his brother, then back to Mike.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       I know.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Gimme a couple days--I'll talk to
                       the P.C.
          
          Bobby again eyes Joseph, who stands over the grave wiping
          his eyes with a handkerchief. He WALKS OVER to him, puts
          his arm around him. Into his ear:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Joe, I'm gonna join you. I just
                       decided...
                              (BEAT)
                       Okay?
          
          Joseph looks at him for a moment, nods subtly.     Then he
          looks back into the grave.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       This is where I belong...
          
          ANGLE BACK on Bobby, as he spots ROSARIO, who stares right
          back at him. He's GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER HIS DECISION.
          A LINE OF POLICEMEN in white gloves begins to FIRE RIFLES
          into the AIR. FIVE SHOTS...
          
                                                                   104.
          
          
          
          EXT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - DAY
          
          A fairly run-down place, on the way to Kennedy Airport.
          
          INT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - SUITE - LIVING ROOM -      DAY
          
          Bobby is still in his funeral suit, standing near the sofa.
          Smoking a cigarette, holding a drink in his hand. An ARMED
          GUARD accompanies Rosario into the hotel room--they've
          arrived home from the funeral separately. She turns her
          back to him, puts her handbag down on a dresser.
          
          Bobby eyes the Guard, who promptly leaves the room.      He
          places his drink on the coffee table.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I wanna talk to you about
                       something.
          
          She turns.    He starts to take off his tie.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       I'm thinking of...maybe joining the
                       Force.
          
          No response from Rosario yet.     Surprised and not surprised.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       I mean, I help find Nezhinski, we
                       don't gotta live like this the rest
                       of our lives--moving every three
                       fuckin' days...
          
          She looks at him for a moment, then stares at the floor.
          Shakes her head. She gets emotional:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby, I don't know if I can be
                       here no more.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       What're you talking about? I just
                       got through telling you--
          
                                       ROSARIO DIAZ
                       No, I think maybe it's time I leave
                       then--go down to Miami on my own,
                       with my mother.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                              (struggling to stay
                               CALM)
                       I can't let you do that. That
                       ain't safe for you.

                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       You know that's not true, Bobby.
                       They're not after me.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Hold on a second--I know what I'm
                       talking about'd be a change.
                              (BEAT)
                       It'd be a big change for us.
          
          She is still shaking her head, still staring at the floor:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       BOBBY--
          
          Bobby gets up, walks over to the desk. Rubs his fingers on
          its surface, not looking at her but resolutely:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       But we could make a life here.
                       This'd be something we could build
                       on. We could raise a family,
                       and...
          
          This seems to focus Rosario who stares at him.      He moves
          closer to her:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Pretty soon you'd fit in.
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       No I wouldn't...
                              (BEAT)
                       They know what I was--what I was
                       DOING--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       They'll accept you if we're

                                      ROSARIO DIAZ
                       Bobby!
          
          She halts him, opens up.     Tearful:
          
                                      ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
                       I gave it all up for you and you

                    You're a fuckin' cokehead--look at

                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Well, maybe I was a piece of shit
                    too! Wasting my goddamned time!
          
          She is momentarily speechless.
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    How could you say that...? We had
                    PLANS--
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    Wake up!   All that was nothing!
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    No! Now is nothing! Look at
                    what's happened to your family,
                    Bobby--your father, he's dead--look
                    at your brother! It could all
                    happen to you!
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    My brother's gonna be all right--
                    and nothing's gonna happen to me.
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ
                    That's what you said before.
          
          A moment, then she turns to walk toward the bedroom.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Hey--where you goin'--
          
          Bobby grabs her.
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Get off me!   Let me go!
          
          He holds her by the wrists:

                    What the fuck you doin'?
          
                                    ROSARIO DIAZ
                    Get off me!

          A TUSSLE. As he tries to restrain her, a torrent of
          emotion explodes from Rosario:
          
                                   ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)
                    Get off me--I don't want it! It's
                    not what I want!
          
          She breaks free. Panting, tears streaming down her cheeks.
          After a beat, Bobby seeks to calm her.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    All right. Why don't you just calm
                    down and think about it a little.
          
          She looks at him, frozen.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    You think about it, you'll feel
                    different. You'll understand. And
                    in time, we'll look back on all
                    this and you'll see I was right.
                    Look--I love you.
                           (BEAT)
                    Why don't you go get some rest?
          
          Without a word, she turns and walks back into the bedroom.
          Closes the door. Bobby sinks to the couch, picks up his
          drink. After a beat, we HEAR a:
          
                                   MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    We appreciate your patience, Bobby.
          
          THE FACE OF SPIRO GIAVANNIS
          
          As he looks into the CAMERA. We can't yet TELL where we
          are. He continues, backing up from us slowly, leading us
          somewhere not yet in focus:
          
                                   SPIRO GIAVANNIS
                    The Commissioner is here now, and
                    he's ready to go.
          
          We PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward,
          in FORMAL POLICE UNIFORM. His HAIR is cut, closely-cropped
          now. He is clean shaven. A REAL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION.
          
          INT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          A lavish room. Filled with photographs of important people
          shaking hands, receiving awards, etc. COMMISSIONER WILLIAM
          RUDDY, a middle-aged, balding, and yes, ruddy-faced man, is
          here.

                                      COMMISSIONER RUDDY
                       We're all very sorry about your
                       father--he was a great man.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Thank you, sir. I'm gonna try and
                       do my part too, now.
          
                                       COMMISSIONER RUDDY
                       Good.   Raise your right hand.
          
          Ruddy leads him to the corner of the office. Bobby is
          guided into position as: the Commissioner picks up a small,
          leather-bound black book. With one hand, he holds the
          Bible upon which Bobby places his hand. With the other, he
          holds a manual, off which he reads an oath:
          
                                      COMMISSIONER RUDDY (CONT'D)
                       "I hereby pledge and declare..."
          
          Bobby repeats after him. (This process continues until the
          entire PLEDGE IS COMPLETED.)
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       "I, Robert Green, hereby pledge and
                       DECLARE--
          
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          Of Bobby in the POLICE ARMORY. He is RECEIVING his GUN and
          his BADGE. Over this, we STILL HEAR:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       "--that I will support and defend

                       United States government and the
                       State of New York, to the best of

          INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY
          
          He walks down the hall, with his back to us.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       "...I will faithfully discharge my

                       So help me God."
          
          BACK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
          
          Ruddy and Giavannis shake Bobby's hand vigorously:

                       Congratulations!
          
          BACK TO THE POLICE STATION HALLWAY
          
          CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY, PAUSING right before he enters the
          MUSTER ROOM. HE takes a breath and ENTERS:
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - MUSTER ROOM
          
          Many cops, mug shots and files strewn all over. A
          discussion, in media res. Many cops approach Bobby, all of
          whom shake his hand, AD-LIBBING WHISPERED "HEY, BOBBY" and
          "WELCOME TO THE FORCE." Bobby thanks them, then moves to
          stand behind his brother. Michael testily grills Jack on
          the investigative progress:
          
                                      MICHAEL   SOLO
                       ...But we got our guys   out there,
                       working the street all   over? I
                       mean, they coupeing or   they
                       working?
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       Everybody's out there, bustin'
                       balls, left and right! What else
                       you want us to do?
          
          As Michael says the following dialog, a UNIFORMED OFFICER
          comes up to Bobby. Sotto, in his ear, he speaks to him:
          
                                      UNIFORMED OFFICER
                       Bobby, a Rosario Diaz's been
                       callin' for you. She says she
                       needs to talk to you.
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Thanks.   I'll call her back.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO (SIMULTANEOUS)
                       Well, you tell Narcotics Queens we
                       got an A-1 sale hanging over our
                       head and either they help us or we
                       fuckin' take it out on `em later!
          
          The Uniformed Officer leaves, and Bobby stays put to hear
          this exchange.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       What about Nezhinski's uncle? That
                       clubowner--Marat Buzhayev?

                       Clean. We tailed him for weeks.
                       Goes out with his grandkids, takes
                       `em horseriding at Floyd Bennett
                       Field... Checks on his fur
                       business from time to time--we even
                       looked at some of the coats and
                       tore `em apart. Turned out to be
                       fake sable, if you could believe
                       it.

                       It's comin' up quick, we don't know
                       anything... We're gonna lose it...
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Joe--this is still new territory
                       for all of us. I mean, we hadda
                       use your brother here to get any
                       results to begin with.
          
          Michael points to Bobby, who up until now had been focused
          on--and concerned by--his brother's behavior.
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       I know that. And my family takes
                       the hit--my family...
          
          An awkward silence.    Everyone's pained.   Bobby stiffens:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Could you guys go outside for a
                       minute? I wanna talk to my
                       brother.
          
          Michael hesitates, then nods. Everyone wheels around and
          exits the room. Jack follows Mike out the door. Bobby
          turns to his brother:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       You're trying to do everything--
                       it's gonna kill you.

                           (INTERRUPTING)
                    Well, I didn't ask you to do that.
                    I don't need your help--I could
                    deal with it on my own.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I know. But you don't gotta do
                    everything yourself. That's what
                    I'm trying to tell you.
          
          Bobby eyes Joseph, who looks deeply troubled.   Bobby sits.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    Joe, what's wrong? Come on, you
                    can tell me.
                           (BEAT)
                    A deal this big, something's gonna
                    come up. You'll see--someone'll
                    fold.
          
          Joseph ponders for a beat, then comes out with it:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    It's not that. It's just... You
                    give up what you wanted to do to be
                    here, Bobby. And part of me feels
                    a little responsible.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's
                    meant to be. You can't fuckin'
                    control it...
          
                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                           (slight laugh)
                    You know, I remember when Pop was
                    mad at you, he always used to say
                    you didn't believe in our family.
                    And Mom, she'd protect you. She'd
                    give you those little caramels...
                    Anyway, I knew he was wrong too,
                    but I didn't say nothing.

                    That's all in the past.
                           (kisses him)
                    I'll see you later.
          
          EXT. PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - DAY
          
          An UNMARKED CAR with Bobby inside pulls up to the front.     A
          GUARD steps forward to greet, protects him.
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM
          
          Bobby enters. There are several guards in the space.
          Bobby scans the room, and quickly notices EVERYTHING OF
          ROSARIO'S IS GONE. Bobby wheels around, to a GUARD.
          INTENSE EXPRESSION.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    What happened--where'd she go?!?
          
                                   GUARD
                    She left about an hour ago.   She
                    said to give you this--
          
          The GUARD hands Bobby a NOTE.   BOBBY SEES IT, GRABS IT
          WITHOUT READING IT.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    We gotta go find her!
          
                                   GUARD
                    She asked us not to, Bobby. She's--
                    Bobby--we can't do that legally!
          
          Bobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain
          him delicately ("C'mon, calm down"), but Bobby is in no
          mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of
          energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue
          him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything
          else, and it is messy, tough:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    DON'T--FUCKIN'--
          
          Bobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards
          rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM
          for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in
          a rage. Then, sarcastic:
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    Go `head!   Keep me in here--KEEP ME
                    HERE!

                                                                      113.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      GUARD'S VOICE (MUFFLED)
                       Bobby, we don't wanna have to put
                       you in restraints, so just calm
                       down!
                              (BEAT)
                       Calm the fuck down!
          
          Bobby stares at the door.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You gonna keep me here? HUH?!?
          
          Still in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR
          REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the
          wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to:
          
          INT. BEDROOM
          
          Where he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck.
          BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He
          throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the
          realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over
          him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs.
          
          It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their
          outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining
          feeling drain from him until he has nothing left.
          
          After this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing
          heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head...
          
          We PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING:
          
          INT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH
          
          A noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching
          boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of
          those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door.
          Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a
          GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an
          answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then:
          
                                       A MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
                       Hello?
          
          A BEAT.   Bobby collects himself.    Then:
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       It's me, Lou.
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER)
                       HEY!!!!   Bobkes!!! How you doin'?!

                       I'm okay. Listen uh, you ain't
                       spoke to Rosario lately, have you?
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       No. She's holed up with you, ain't
                       she?--God knows where.
          
                                      BOBBY   GREEN
                       Yeah--it's just, she   must've gone
                       out for a little bit   and...I wanted
                       to get in touch with   her.
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Well, I talk to her, I'll tell her
                       you called.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Thanks... You know, things are
                       really changing on my end. I ain't
                       gonna be in protection anymore.
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER)
                       Oh Bob! That's great! Whaddaya

                                      LOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER)
                       Come on! El Caribe's got their

                       I'll be there--what more could ask
                       for! C'mon! You comin'? Huh?
                              (BEAT)
                       You gonna be a man or not?
          
          ANGLE on BOBBY as we GO TO:
          
          INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
          
          A SHOW is about to go on. The place has a darker quality
          to it now, and many patrons are wearing HALLOWEEN MASKS.
          BOBBY ENTERS, approaches a table in the back, where seated
          are Louis and Louis' girlfriend, HAZEL. Lou is armed with
          a huge grin, and he stands and hugs Bobby:
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI
                       My brother!   The Grand Return!
          
          As they sit, Lou notices Bobby is alone:

                       You ain't heard from Rosario yet?
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       No...
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI
                              (moves closer)
                       You want Hazel here to fix you up
                       with a little something? I'm only
                       kiddin'--let's have a drink--
                              (to a waitress)
                       Hey Natasha, over there!
          
                                      HAZEL
                       Why don't you slow down a little?
                       You're already acting stupid!
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       And you're already acting like a
                       pain in my ass! I can hold my
                       liquor and yours!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Jumbo, I don't want nothing right
                       now--don't worry about it.
          
          JUST THEN, THE HOUSE LIGHTS DIM.    A SPOTLIGHT on the STAGE.
          
          MARAT BUZHAYEV ambles up to the microphone with some
          difficulty.
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       Good evening. My name is Marat
                       Buzhayev, and I'm the owner of the
                       El Caribe. We have a special
                       night, tonight--the Odessa Dance
                       Troop is here to perform for us. I
                       know you'll enjoy it.
          
          APPLAUSE.    Marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)
                       We also have an old friend who's
                       come back to us--I want him to
                       stand--Bobby? Ladies and
                       gentlemen, Bobby Green, who used to
                       be our manager here...
          
          MORE APPLAUSE. THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands
          briefly, sheepishly. Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits.
          The SPOTLIGHT swings back to Marat who finishes up his
          introduction ("Enjoy the show!
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          Thank you.") and exits to still more applause. ELI
          MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law, approaches Bobby. In his
          EAR:
          
                                   ELI MIRICHENKO
                    My father-in-law would love it if
                    you come upstairs later, to say
                    hello.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    Okay, Eli.   Tell him I'll come up.
          
          Eli nods, exits.   Beat.   Then, sensing Bobby's mood:
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Bob, you all right?
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (hesitates; then)
                    Rosario--Rosario's gone down to
                    Florida for a little while.
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Florida?
                           (BEAT)
                    Well, she probably just needed a
                    little time for herself. She'll be
                    back.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    Yeah...
                           (more interior)
                    You know, I was just thinking `bout
                    when I first met her here...
                    Working back there...
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Ah, don't worry, Bob. I have no
                    doubt she'll be back.
          
          Louis turns to watch the show for a beat, takes a huge swig
          of his DRINK. Then turns AROUND AGAIN; close to Bobby:
          
                                    LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)
                    I mean, between you and me, that
                    place they had you in was drivin'
                    her crazy. The Kew Motor Inn--we
                    used to call that the SCREW Motor
                    Inn, with all the hookers...
                           (back to Hazel)
                    Get that waitress wouldja?
          
          Louis turns back to the show. The camera moves into a
          CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as Louis' words FREEZE him. He seems
          ready to EXPLODE. Then, finally:

                    How'd you know where I was staying?
          
                                     LOUIS FALSETTI
                    Huh?
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    How'd you know where I was staying?
          
                                    LOUIS FALSETTI
                           (CAUGHT)
                    It was, it was in the papers...
          
          Bobby gets up with astonishing speed and moves right next
          to Louis. He grabs his arm tightly and, in his ear:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    It wasn't in no papers, Louis.
                    Don't make me embarrass you. Let's
                    go outside, right now.
          
          The camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on LOUIS as he FRETS...
          
          EXT. BACK ALLEY
          
          Still grabbing Louis's arm, Bobby wrenches him loose.
          Louis stumbles and falls to the asphalt. Bobby steps
          FORWARD. Something is different about him now. He is
          colder than ice, his eyes black saucers of rage.
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Where's Nezhinski?
          
                                     LOUIS FALSETTI
                    I don't know--
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Don't play games with me, Louis.
          
                                   LOUIS FALSETTI
                    But I don't kn--
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    I just said, DO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH
                    ME!
                           (BEAT)
                    Rosario tol' you where we were
                    staying, didn't she?!? She trusted
                    you...
          
          Louis begins to crack.   Tears come to his eyes...

                       Bob, we're, we're buddies--we're
                       like brothers! C'mon!
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       You don't mean nothing to me now--
                       that part of my life is dead.
                              (beat; for himself)
                       Today it ended for good...
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Bobby I swear--I don't know
                       nothing!
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You know my father is dead because
                       of you?
          
          Louis begins to sob quietly, shivering. He brings his hand
          to his mouth. Bobby takes a threatening step forward:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       You know I'm on the Force now? And
                       I could do anything to you?
          
          Louis' eyes widen.    He holds out his hands defensively.
          
                                       LOUIS FALSETTI
                       No, wait! Bob, please!
                              (beat; weakening)
                       Don't do this to me...
                              (even softer)
                       Don't do this to me Bob, please...
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You tell me what you know right now
                       or I swear to Christ I will make
                       you disappear.
          
          Louis is crying loudly, like a ten year-old. He falls to
          his knees. Shivering in fear, he moves to Bobby's feet:
          
                                      LOUIS FALSETTI
                       Bobby, I... I told `em where you
                       were--but, but it ain't what you
                       think! I was makin' a buy and
                       these guys in hoods, they held a
                       gun to my head--so I tried to give
                       `em the wrong information!
          
          Bobby clenches his fist.    Louis grabs onto him again:
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                    No, wait, listen! It's true!
                    Rosario tol' me you moved every
                    couple days, she said you was gonna
                    move--I thought you'd be gone by
                    then! It's the truth, Bobby! I
                    would never try and hurt you!
                    Never, swear to God!
          
          Bobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit. He
          tries to calm himself but cannot. With a ferocity, he
          unleashes a brutal punch across Louis' face with the brunt
          of his fist. Louis collapses. In Louis' ear:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    You tell me, right now--

                    Where's your fuckin' spot?!?
          
                                                       CUT TO:
          
          THE CAMERA DOLLIES past A SHOOTING GALLERY. ADDICTS, their
          inert bodies both crumpled and standing in virtual trances,
          wander an ALLEYWAY. They RECOIL from CAR HEADLIGHTS:
          
          EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING
          
          An American sedan, a DARK BLUE car, pulls up to the
          building. A man gets out--we can't quite tell who it is
          yet...
          
          INT. DARK AND DIRTY HALLWAY - ABANDONED APARTMENT BUILDING
          
          A young AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE stands in a doorway, dressed
          in a green parka. The hall, covered with trash and
          graffiti, is illuminated by a solitary light bulb. He
          guards ANOTHER SHOOTING GALLERY, which is in the room right
          behind him.
          
          FOOTSTEPS. The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE is on guard. The MAN
          emerges from the darkness, his back STILL TO US. Upon
          seeing him, the African-American Man smiles, reaches into
          his pocket. Hands the unseen man a small yellow envelope:
          
                                   AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN
                    I got your money man, but my shit's
                    running low. When you get me more?
          
                                    MAN'S VOICE (SLIGHT ACCENT)
                           (as he counts the $)
                    Just hold on a little while longer--
                    we get more for you soon.

                       Yeah?   When's that gonna be?
          
                                       MAN'S VOICE
                       Tomorrow.
          
          We CUT TO the over-the-shoulder of the man, and leaning out
          of the DARKNESS and into the LIGHT: ELI MIRICHENKO, Marat's
          son-in-law. He continues:
          
                                      ELI MIRICHENKO
                       After tomorrow, everybody's gonna
                       get well.
          
          The African-American Man nods. Satisfied with the cash,
          Eli turns around, walks back down the hallway. ANGLE BACK
          ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN as the camera zooms past him, into:
          
          INT. SHOOTING GALLERY
          
          In the darkness, among the addicts: BOBBY GREEN. His face
          illuminated only by the sliver of light from the crack in
          the door. He's witnessed the whole thing... We HEAR:
          
                                       COP'S VOICE (O.S.)
                       We got your boy Eli completely
                       covered, Bobby.
          
          INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          The group is all together. Cops we don't know pack the
          room, standing around the table. Seated at the table:
          Michael, Jack, Bobby, and at the head, Joseph. A TOUGH-
          LOOKING COP we've seen before but not met:
          
                                      TOUGH-LOOKING COP
                       He just turned in for the night.

                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Well, he said tomorrow and that's
                       what matters.
          
                                      TOUGH-LOOKING COP
                       And we'll be right there with him--

                       repeated 25 times.
          
          EVERYONE LAUGHS.     Bobby turns to Joseph:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Pop would never bring `em in, Joe.
                       We gotta see this through
                       ourselves...
          
                                        JACK SHAPIRO
                       Bobby's right.
          
          Joseph's back stiffens.       With resolve:
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Yeah, definitely... We'll get the

                              (INTENSE)
                       And wherever it is, we'll be ready

                       Arright, guys.    That's it for now.
          
          The troops get up to leave.      Jack approaches Joseph.
          SOTTO:

                       Yeah?
          
          Bobby looks at Jack--who leans in, to Joseph's ear:
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       You know, they're laughin' at us,
                       out there on the street. Now when
                       we get there, it'll be up to you
                       what we do. But I hope you think
                       about droppin' the hammer on `em.
          
          Joseph contemplates this briefly, then Jack pulls him
          CLOSER:

          Bobby senses the pressure being placed upon his brother,
          and he moves Jack away from Joseph:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    All right, c'mon. Enough...
          
          ANGLE ON BOBBY, JOSEPH as we GO TO:
          
          EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD - LATE NIGHT/DAWN
          
          SERIES OF SHOTS of:
          
          1. WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed
          growth that is extremely dense.
          
          2. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An
          old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA
          project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom,
          probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned.
          
          3. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from
          high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL
          WEEDS AROUND IT.
          
          4. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving.
          Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed
          with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET:
          
          AN ARRIVING LIVERY CAR.
          
          Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases--
          presumably filled with money.
          
          THEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR.    And yet ANOTHER.
          
          The men all congregate like it's a legal business
          transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES.
          
          We PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE:
          Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The
          camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and
          other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS.
          One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and
          our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES...

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          ANOTHER CAR ARRIVES. APPEARING out of it is VADIM
          NEZHINSKI. Joseph bristles at the sight of him. Bobby
          grabs his brother's arm, squeezes:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       We're gonna get all of `em today.
          
          JUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out.
          They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number
          of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the
          shack...
          
          ALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this?
          ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto.
          Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's
          the EMPEROR...
          
          EMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli,
          helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other.
          They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the
          devastation. Almost to himself:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Lookit the two of them...they're so
                       fuckin' close...
          
          Then the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the
          back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless.
          
          STANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed
          with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions
          closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN.
          
          BUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by
          NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many
          other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand.
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       Okay--when they complete the sale,
                       that's when we move. ESU'll grab
                       the kids.
          
          A TRANSACTION BEGINS inside the shack, and the COPS are
          WATCHING. They SEE the action through BROKEN WINDOWS...
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          NEZHINSKI and MARAT, with the Businessmen. He looks behind
          him, to MARAT, who steps forward. In Russian:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)
                       This's what we've been planning for
                       for so long. My nephew has stayed
                       just to see this through.

                       When this is done, we'll control
                       almost the whole market.
                              (motions to Man)
                       Each load is completely
                       untraceable. It's my own method.
          
          The Man places a FUR on a distressed countertop.    Rips it
          apart. Nezhinski steps forward:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)
                       The rest of the product is in the
                       van--total weight, 75 kilos.
          
          Places one of the lengths of fur into: A BASIN filled with
          fluid... The CAMERA ZOOMS into A CLOSE SHOT on the FUR in
          that basin...
          
          The FUR IS POKED a COUPLE OF TIMES. A beat. Then: WHITE
          PLUMES RISE from the coat's fabric to the top of the
          liquid, and Eli begins to skim the substance off the
          surface.
          
          DUMPING OUT   some of the substance (now in crystalline form)
          onto a pad,   MARAT BUZHAYEV hands it to a BUSINESSMAN, who
          TASTES it.    THE BUSINESSMAN nods, pleased with his
          product...    He reaches for a SUITCASE. It is OPENED.
          Filled with   MONEY.
          
          EXT. FIELD
          
          Bobby and Joseph.    Joseph has his earpiece, HEARS.     Then:
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       The deal's closing--let's go!
          
          Bobby gets up, out of the weeds, SHOTGUN aimed:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You're surrounded by the police!
                       Come out now, with your hands on
                       your heads!
          
          INT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE
          
          Vadim and Marat SNAP TO ATTENTION. SHOCKED. RUSSIAN WORDS
          ARE EXCHANGED, and everyone starts to PANIC...
          
          EXT. FIELD
          
          The COPS begin the assault, EXPLODING FROM EVERYWHERE.
          SIRENS, the whole thing. Bobby and Joseph get up, stand
          into a crouch and move slowly toward the structure. A GROUP
          OF ESU COPS charge MARAT'S CAR, GOING FOR THE CHILDREN--who
          watch this with fear and incomprehension...

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          An ARMED GUARD, standing outside the shack, begins to fire
          at the cops. EVERYONE OPENS FIRE.
          
          ALL OF A SUDDEN: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we saw at
          Joseph's house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the
          Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near
          Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp.
          
          CLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH
          CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING... He cannot bear reliving
          the terror of his moment...
          
          As the COPS move in: Bobby spins around to look for his
          brother. He finds him still on the ground. Joseph seems
          unable to move, holding onto his shotgun for dear life:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Joe?!
          
          Joseph looks at his brother, shakes his head. Completely
          shattered in the moment. STILL. SHOTS RING OUT. Bobby
          pushes his brother down on the ground. In his ear:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Arright, just stay down!
          
          Chaos begins. All of the men inside the small building
          have aimed their guns into the WEEDS. But instead of
          stopping because of the shooting, Bobby progresses
          inexorably toward the structure, his shotgun poised to
          fire.
          
          NOW MICHAEL and JACK and OTHER MEMBERS of the NARCOTICS
          TEAMS come out of the WEEDS. THEY FIRE their WEAPONS.
          
          MARAT'S GRANDCHILDREN are DRAGGED OUT OF THE CAR, CRYING
          LOUDLY...
          
          FIFTY YARDS AWAY
          
          A LINE of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS forms. They move in
          unison. Seems like a hundred men. Bobby and Jack and some
          of his men are coming from one side, the line from another.
          
          SIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit--
          fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back
          entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph
          remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head.
          We cannot SEE his face...
          
          INT. ABANDONED BATHROOM STRUCTURE
          
          Vadim Nezhinski is frazzled by the approaching FORCE he

          CONTINUED:
          
          Moving with tremendous speed, he begins to light the FURS
          on FIRE... SMOKE... Vadim BEGINS TO COUGH, taking a
          suitcase of money with him. He backs out of the STRUCTURE.
          
          EXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD
          
          BILIOUS CLOUDS OF SMOKE.     BOBBY is MOVING TOWARD THE
          BUILDING.
          
          VADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE
          REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and
          SILENT.
          
          BOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI
          CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM:
          
                                       JACK SHAPIRO
                       Stop!   Halt!
          
          Jack ruthlessly pumps Eli full of bullets, and the man
          falls down dead. Jack approaches, mercilessly FIRES
          ANOTHER SHOT into the corpse...
          
          INT. WEEDS
          
          The WIND HOWLS... Tall, tawny-colored weeds, marsh. BOBBY
          moves through the DENSE WEED GROWTH. Pushing his way
          through the brown plants.
          
          We HEAR POLICE DOGS. BOBBY starts THRASHING. The CAMERA
          is HAND-HELD, MOVING TO AND FRO WITH FEROCIOUS and
          VERTIGINOUS SPEED. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we:

          Bobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES
          GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING.
          BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he
          can't tell who's who. CONFUSION...
          
          BOBBY STOPS. FEET CRUSHING THE TWIGS... A GUNSHOT, FROM
          WHERE, GOD ONLY KNOWS... A RUSH OF IMAGES--SHADOWED
          FIGURES, OBSCURED BY THE WEEDS, APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR LIKE
          PHANTOMS...
          
          BOBBY'S HEARTBEAT THUMPS ON THE SOUNDTRACK... A MAN
          backing up toward him; each man has his back to the

          BOBBY DOESN'T SEE HIM YET. BUT WE CAN. THE CAMERA ZOOMS
          INTO BOBBY, WITH THE FIGURE BEHIND HIM. BOBBY SEES THE
          SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY...raises his
          weapon, about to FIRE when he realizes:
          
          It's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's
          almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of
          Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND,
          he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED:
          
                                      MICHAEL SOLO
                       This's too dangerous. We'll all
                       wind up killing each other--

                       Vadim is in here with us. Radio
                       our guys, tell `em to get into the
                       clearing.
          
          ALL OF A SUDDEN, we HEAR, SHOUTED:

                       Bobby!   We got the old man!
          
          Bobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael
          nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio ("Our
          guys, outta the brush!") Bobby starts to back up, toward
          the clearing...
          
          EXT. CLEARING
          
          Bobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including
          Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack
          APPROACHES:
          
                                      JACK SHAPIRO
                       We got the old man--Buzhayev. Up
                       by the cars. His grandkids are
                       safe--they're in the van.
          
          Bobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Are all our guys out?
          
          The Officer looks, counts.     Then nods.   Bobby looks toward
          the weeds and says:
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Burn it.
          
          SEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS.

          TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are
          carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO
          SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO
          GO IN.
          
                                       MICHAEL SOLO
                       Bobby?   What're you doin'--
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       I'm not gonna let him get away...
          
          AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE
          FIRE...
          
          INT. FIERY WEEDS
          
          Bobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The
          ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to
          right...
          
          CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND...
          BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping
          forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING...
          JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE...
          
          Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY,
          AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING...
          SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING...
          
          A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE,
          WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY.
          
          VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT.
          
          Within what seems like a split second, Bobby raises his
          SHOTGUN and FIRES it. VADIM CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. A
          DIRECT HIT to the chest.
          
          Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds
          separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that
          registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit.
          Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the
          energy he has in the world:
          
                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI
                       Don't...don't let me die in here...
          
          Bobby stands over him for a BEAT. Then Bobby turns his
          back on Vadim, walks through the fires around him. As
          Vadim calls after him ("BOBBY!
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  129.
          CONTINUED:
          
          PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!"), the flames begin to engulf
          the area where Nezhinski lies...
          
          EXT. FIELD
          
          BOBBY EMERGES FROM THE FIRE...     HE WALKS TOWARD THE POLICE
          CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED     around: MARAT BUZHAYEV.
          BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT,    HIS FACE filled with
          CONTROLLED RAGE. BEAT. EACH MAN    STARES AT EACH OTHER. THEN:
          
                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV
                       Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be
                       your family--
          
          BOBBY TAKES A THREATENING STEP FORWARD. Bobby's expression
          seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes
          a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's
          emotions are a CAULDRON:
          
                                       BOBBY GREEN
                       Get down!   On the ground!
          
          Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's
          hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN.
          
          BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE.    We HEAR the
          DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS...
          
          The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face
          and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby
          turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him,
          dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making
          eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all
          of them and none of them in particular:
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                       Put him in the fuckin' van...
                       Don't touch him...
          
          Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO
          BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops
          watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him.
          He proceeds on toward the cars.
          
          HE SEES: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring at him.
          WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES
          DOWN, stays by JOSEPH...
          
          CLOSE SHOT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD, SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS:
          
          "ONE P.M.: N.Y.P.D. EVENT - ACADEMY GRADUATION."
          
                                                                   130.
          
          
          
          INT. ONE POLICE PLAZA - FOYER - OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
          
          HUNDREDS OF POLICE OFFICERS, all dressed up to the nines,
          are HERE. White gloves and all. Milling about in a white
          plaster walled room. Upbeat chatter. Then: Bobby emerges
          through the DOORS in his DRESS BLUES. Upon seeing him, the
          others smile, CHEER. People touch him, shake his hand.
          Eye him with respect. AD-LIB GREETINGS.
          
                                   RANDOM OFFICERS
                    Bobby! Hey! Lookit you--six
                    months in the Academy and already
                    you look like a chief!
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN
                    Hey everybody...
          
          Bobby moves toward the AUDITORIUM DOORS.   Now Michael
          approaches. In Bobby's ear:
          
                                   MICHAEL SOLO
                    I just saw the commissioner. A
                    lotta people're gonna wanna talk to
                    you--important people. About maybe
                    settin' you up with your own unit.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                    All right.   We'll talk about that
                    after.
          
          Bobby sees: JOSEPH, STANDING nearby with his hand on his
          child's shoulder, the rest of his FAMILY SURROUNDING HIM.
          The brothers embrace. Then:
          
                                   BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)
                    They're getting started--we should
                    probably go in now.
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM
          
          The ceremony is getting underway. As Bobby and Joseph move
          past the seated crowd toward their chairs in front:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    You know, I think Pop would be real
                    happy to see you like this.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (slight ironic laugh)
                    I don't think he'd believe it...
                    But I guess things don't always go
                    the way you think they will.
          
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  131.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Ah, the Force'll treat you good.
                       I'm sure you do very well.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       You definitely gonna leave? Ain't
                       no way you change your mind?
          
                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                              (shakes head; then:)
                       It's the right thing. It's over
                       for me--I'm out.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Listen, we'll spend some more time
                       together from now on. Okay? I'll
                       come over next week.
          
                                        JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                       Arright, yeah.    Sounds good.
          
          Bobby approaches the POLICE CHAPLAIN, hands him a note.
          
                                      BOBBY GREEN
                       Chaplain? I'd like you to
                       introduce me this way. If you
                       don't mind.
          
          The CHAPLAIN looks at the paper, nods. He then walks to
          the podium. Bobby sits as the Chaplain begins:
          
                                      POLICE CHAPLAIN
                       Ladies and gentlemen: we shall
                       begin today's ceremony with the
                       traditional invocation, moving then
                       to the valedictorian address to be
                       given by...Robert Grusinsky. Son
                       of the late Deputy Chief Albert
                       Grusinsky, brother of Captain
                       Joseph Grusinsky.
          
          ANGLE ON BOBBY as his REAL NAME is SPOKEN:
          
                                       POLICE CHAPLAIN (CONT'D)
                       You know, as I look at this fine
                       young man seated here, I can't help
                       but think about all the young
                       members of our department. I get
                       filled with such pride.
                              (BEAT)
                       Men like him are the great future
                       of our Force...
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                               132.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
          As the man speaks, Bobby SCANS the room. HE SEES ROSARIO,
          standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face
          is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF
          EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon
          catching a glimpse of her.
          
          But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears
          when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that
          IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a
          faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over:
          
                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
                    I love you, Bobby.
          
                                    BOBBY GREEN
                           (back to reality)
                    Love you too, Joe.
          
          Police line up on the stage. Everyone's seated, Bobby and
          Joseph in front. The POLICE BAND begins to play the drums.
          Bobby straightens up, raises his hand--along with the sea
          of blue--in a SALUTE as the flag is carried to the front.
          

                                     THE END
WHAT LIES BENEATH

FADE IN:

Moving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts
of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance.
Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.
We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens
into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,
arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by
flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING
GREEN EYES, which blink closed...

                                                    MORPH TO:

...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from
water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in
her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the
kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,
reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being
pulled.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.

A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire
starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the
red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark
shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer
starts whirring again.

She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She
regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-
looking woman around forty.

Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR
above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,
as if confirming her existence.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door,
listening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence.
She quietly pushes open the door.

INT.  ROOM - DAY

Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:

A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A
24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE
LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.

The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE
still shrouded by covers.

Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room
briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a
tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.

She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped
hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the
sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her
hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly.

                     CLAIRE
          Morning, beauty.

Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.

                     CLAIRE
          Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time.

From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.

                     CAITLIN
               (muffled)
          I'm totally ready.

Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on, I'll make you some waffles,
          maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the
          mall.
               (beat)
          Caitlin...

Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's
behind.

                     CAITLIN
          Mother...

Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from
the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.
Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.

                     CAITLIN
          You're such a morning person.

Claire turns at the door.

                     CLAIRE
          It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the
          plastic.

She starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out.

                     CAITLIN (O.S.)
          Blueberries!

Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  When
she stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She
gazes down, transfixed.

ANGLE

Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG
COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.
Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an
unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood
of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the
woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.

A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a
small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's
husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.
He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks
beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him
look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the
prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take
her eyes off the scene below.

                     NORMAN
          They at it again?

Claire nods.

                     NORMAN
          Christ, that's twice in...When did they
          move in?

                     CLAIRE
          I think three...

                     NORMAN
          Three weeks.

She continues to gaze downward.  The man leans over the hood,
murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman
the scene is entirely silent.

                     CLAIRE
          What's their name?

                     NORMAN
          Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures.
          They're all psychotic.

Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house.  Norman
begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire.  Her eyes close, but
then she gently demurs.

                     CLAIRE
          She's awake.

                     NORMAN
          We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.

She turns to him.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't want to be either.

He smiles.  A really good smile.  The lips and tongue on his
faded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.

                     NORMAN
          When's she out of here?

                     CLAIRE
          Norman Spencer.

Norman gives up.  He busses her cheek.

                     NORMAN
               (moving toward the stairs)
          Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm
          going to class.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, I have to show up for the--

                     CLAIRE
          It's Saturday.

Norman stops.

                     NORMAN
          I knew that.  You think I didn't know
          that?

She smiles at him.  After a beat:

                     NORMAN
          It's today?

                     CLAIRE
               (wistfully)
          Yep.

They share a warm, poignant look.  He turns and moves down
the stairs.

                     NORMAN
               (calling over his shoulder)
          We're going to have to leave by three if
          we want to beat the traffic.

Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr. Feur says
something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
               (absently)
          Three o'clock.

Mrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.

EXT.  SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

Claire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and I still think we should get you
          some mittens.

Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.
The bond between them is palpable.

                     CLAIRE
          Do you have a scarf?

                     CAITLIN
          Hey.

Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes?

                     CAITLIN
          It's only two hours away.

                     CLAIRE
          I know that.

                     CAITLIN
          I'll come back all the time.

                     CLAIRE
          Of course you will.

                     CAITLIN
          I'm just saying, you're going to be
          fine.

Claire smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          Sweetheart, I've known this day was
          coming for a long time.  I've got your
          father and the garden and the new house.
          You really don't have to worry.

Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some
concern.  Claire takes her hand.

                     CLAIRE
          Really.

She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Her
eyes close.

                     CAITLIN (V.O.)
          Mother...

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

Claire's frozen in the hug.

                     CAITLIN
               (beat)
          Mom.

Her eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on
the college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the
background.

                     CAITLIN
          I have'ta go.

After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlin
glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed
this overt display of maternal affection.

                     CAITLIN
          I'll call you.

Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her
daughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.

                     CLAIRE
          Come home anytime.

Caitlin looks at Norman.

                     NORMAN
          Really gonna leave me, huh?

She nods.  They share a tender look.

                     NORMAN
          Be good.

She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bit
overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of
Caitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back...

                     CAITLIN
          Bye.

...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old
Columbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals which
reads:

                  "WELCOME CLASS OF '04."

Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Her
eyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist as
she daps at a tear with a Kleenex.

                     CLAIRE
               (smiling)
          I almost made it.

They turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last look
over her shoulder.

ANGLE

Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton
nightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.

She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him
and starts reading.  After a moment:

                     NORMAN
          Whatcha reading?

                     CLAIRE
               (reading the cover, sexy voice)
          Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic
          organisms.

                     NORMAN
               (slight smile)
          How is it?

Claire snuggles up.

                     CLAIRE
          Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells
          just gang divided a virginal cheerleader
          cell.

                     NORMAN
               (lost in his book)
          Nice.
               (beat)
          Almost done.

She pulls slightly away.

                     CLAIRE
          If you have to work...

                     NORMAN
          No, no.  I'm just about...
               (beat)
          There.

He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her.

                     NORMAN
          How are you?

                     CLAIRE
          Fine.

                     NORMAN
          It's okay if you're not.

                     CLAIRE
          I am, really.

                     NORMAN
          It's just she's been the focus for a
          while.

                     CLAIRE
          Not the focus.

                     NORMAN
          You know what I mean.

Claire thinks for a moment.

                     CLAIRE
          To tell you the truth...I'm
          excited.

                     NORMAN
          You are...

                     CLAIRE
          To get my life back.  To have some time
          for myself.  Some time for us.

He caresses her.

                     NORMAN
          You did a great job.  She's a good kid.

                     CLAIRE
          We did.

There's a weighty pause.

                     NORMAN
          It's just us now.

                     CLAIRE
          I know.

He kisses her.

                     NORMAN
          Tired?

                     CLAIRE
          Nope.

                     NORMAN
          Wanna fool around?

                     CLAIRE
          Yup.

They start to kiss.  It's slow and a bit methodical in the
manner of long time lovers.  Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN
WAILING can be heard.  They stop.

                     NORMAN
          Did you...

                     CLAIRE
          Shhh.

They listen.  The sounds start to become louder.  It is
clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and
savage love making.

                     NORMAN
          Jesus.

He walks over and closes the window.  It doesn't help.

                     NORMAN
          I guess they're making up.

The woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.

                     CLAIRE
          What is he doing to her?

They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.

                     NORMAN
          And we moved out here for the quiet.

                     CLAIRE
          Mmm.

Beat.  The mood has passed.

                     NORMAN
          Maybe we should just...

                     CLAIRE
          Tomorrow.

                     NORMAN
          I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with
          Stan.

                     CLAIRE
          After that.

                     NORMAN
          I'll be there.

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Love you.

She smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          Night.

They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally
climax.

INT.  CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAY

Claire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an
armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY.  She moves quickly to the bureau,
not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY
BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She's
just about to close it, when something catches her eye.

CLAIRE'S POV

She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old
JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.
Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of
Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,
STUFFED ANIMALS.

She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in
the smells.  She stares down at the word "Juilliard."

                                                MATCH CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - DAY

"JUILLIARD"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's
wearing it and she's much younger.  It's an old photograph in
an album.  Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his
arm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her.

Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and
sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at
other photos.

-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux
   with a very wide bow-tie.

-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.  A
   tiny Caitlin rests on her hip.

Claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - DAY

Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the
immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.

The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly,
she hears something coming from next door.

She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It
is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes
her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered.

She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is
A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers
her nerve and calls out...

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...

There's no reaction.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur?

The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blue
shape vanishes from view.

                     CLAIRE
          Wait a minute.  I just want--

Something bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  She
hears heavy breathing.

                     MRS. FEUR
               (sniffling)
          Who are you?

                     CLAIRE
          It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From
          next door.  Is everything--

                     MRS. FEUR
          You're the flower lady.

                     CLAIRE
          Um...yes.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I've seen you.  From the window.

                     CLAIRE
          Is everything alright?

Claire leans closer to the tiny crack.  She sees a fleshy
blur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response,
just the breathing.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?

                     MRS. FEUR
          I'm not...

She seems on the verge of losing it again.

                     MRS. FEUR
          He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I
          can't breath...

                     CLAIRE
          Who?  Your husband?

                     MRS. FEUR
          And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid
          of...

She trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          What?  What are you afraid of?

                     MRS. FEUR
          I can't, no, no, I can't...

Claire edges closer to the crack.

                     CLAIRE
          Tell me.  Please.

                     MRS. FEUR
          That I'll just...that one day I'll
          just...disappear.

Beat.  Claire's taken aback by this admission.

                     CLAIRE
          Tell me.  I can help you.

                     MRS. FEUR
          How?  How can you help me?  With your
          flowers and your perfect life...

                     CLAIRE
          That's not...It's not like that.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I've never even met you.

                     CLAIRE
          I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed
          with...my daughter left...for school.

                     MRS. FEUR
          This fence...it's so...

                     CLAIRE
          I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why
          don't you...

Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
the Feur's driveway.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please
          forget that I...I don't know what I'm
          saying.  Please...

                     CLAIRE
          Wait!  Don't go...

Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by a
LARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut.  A CAR DOOR swings open and a
MAN'S SHOES follow down the path.

Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
as the door closes a second time.  She sits there for a
moment listening, but all is quiet.

                     CLAIRE (V.O.)
          She sounded terrified.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Claire and Norman eat dinner.  A rainstorm pelts the windows.

                     NORMAN
          Of what?

                     CLAIRE
          Of him I think.

                     NORMAN
          Did she say that?

                     CLAIRE
          More or less.

Norman chews.

                     NORMAN
          Honey, they're young.  They're probably
          newlyweds.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm telling you.  There was something in
          her voice...

                     NORMAN
          Remember how we were?

                     CLAIRE
          Not like this.  We were never like this.
               (beat)
          I want to go over there.  After dinner, we
          can--

                     NORMAN
          Why?

                     CLAIRE
          To make sure she's all right.

Norman puts down his fork.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, honey, we are not going to march
          next door and accuse our new neighbor of--

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          That's not what I'm sug--

                     NORMAN
          ...when tonight they'll probably be
          keeping us awake.

                     CLAIRE
          But what if something happens?

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
          I'd never be able to live with mysel--

                     NORMAN
               (reassuring)
          Nothing's going to happen.
               (beat)
          Besides, I have to work tonight.  The
          conference is in less than two weeks.
          I've got to stay focused on that for just
          a little longer.
               (beat)
          This is...

                     CLAIRE
          I know.

                     NORMAN
          It's what I've been working for.

She glances down at her untouched plate.

                     CLAIRE
          I just wish you could have heard her.

                     NORMAN
          Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych
          department, see what I can find out.

                     CLAIRE
          Promise?

He gives her a "Didn't I just say so" look.  She smiles.

                     CLAIRE
          I'll make you some coffee.

She reaches for his plate to clear it.  Norman grabs her hand
and kisses it.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Norman snores softly.  Claire is awakened by the continuing
STORM.  She pads out to Norman's turreted library.  Rain
pelts the glass.  Her face is briefly illuminated by the
LIGHTHOUSE BEAM.

She hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get a
better view of the Feur's.  Nothing but blackness.  Just as
she's turning to go back to bed.  A LIGHTNING FLASH lights up
the night.  Claire's eyes go wide.

CLAIRE'S POV

In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in
shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the
open trunk of his car.

                     CLAIRE
               (in a hoarse whisper)
          Norman!

He's dead to the world.  She calls to him again.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman, you have to look at this!

                     NORMAN
          Mmnph.

                     CLAIRE
          Hurry...

Another flash illuminates...Norman at her side.

                     CLAIRE
          Look!

...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness.

                     NORMAN
          What is it?  What's the matter?

She stares down into the darkness.

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw
          something.

                     NORMAN
          Is it gone?

THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods.

                     NORMAN
          Come on, let's go back to bed.

Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the
window.

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Claire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aims
her camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at the
FEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulled
open, but no one's there.

Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  The
morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL
PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.

She glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOW
CLOSED.

She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.
When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers
across the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses:

A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a car
pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her
perch.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

Claire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in
her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.

                     CLAIRE
          Hey there.

Jody hugs her.

                     JODY
          How you holding up?

                     CLAIRE
          Good.  I'm good.

                     JODY
          You are?

                     CLAIRE
          Why does everyone find that so
          surprising?

                     JODY
               (are you kidding?)
          Cause...your...only daughter just went
          away to school...who you were incredibly
          close with aaand I'd be tripping...

                     CLAIRE
          Okay, I'm a little tender.

                     JODY
          Well good.  So you're human.

                     CLAIRE
          And so far my day has consisted of taking
          pictures of my roses for the garden club.

                     JODY
          Wow.  Got here just in time.
               (reaching into her bag)
          I brought you this.

She proffers several homemade tea bags.

                     CLAIRE
          What is it?

                     JODY
          Kambucha mushroom tea...

                     CLAIRE
          Jody--

                     JODY
          It soothes heart-ache and promotes
          psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--

                     CLAIRE
          You're discussing me with your psychic?

                     JODY
          She's not a psychic.  Just a very
          enlightened spirit.

                     CLAIRE
          Thanks, but I'm fine.

                     JODY
               (pressing it into her hand)
          So you'll have some later.
               (beat)
          Notice anything...different?

Claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint
Karman-Ghia behind her.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh my god.  You bought it.

                     JODY
          Yep.

                     CLAIRE
          It's niiice.

                     JODY
          Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband,
          get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up
          dudes?

                     CLAIRE
          Absolutely.

                     JODY
          Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought
          I'd stop by and see if you want to take
          the boat out, say Thursday morning?

                     CLAIRE
          You got it.

Jody grins.

                     JODY
          See you then.

Jody drives off.  Claire walks down the driveway to her front
door and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.  She
starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.

Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
doorknob.  She stops.  A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from
within.  Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:

INT.  FOYER - DAY

Claire stops inside the door.  Now it sounds like WHISPERING.
Two voices, tense, impassioned.  It seems to be coming from
Norman's study.  She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the
room.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

But the whispering has suddenly stopped.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?

The lovely circular room is completely empty.  She looks
around, puzzled.  Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually
ambles over.

                     CLAIRE
               (to Cooper)
          Please tell me you heard that.

EXT.  LAKE - DAY

Claire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at
the water's edge.  Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who
bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.  Claire gazes at the
LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.
Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.

Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark
water.

                     CLAIRE
          Cooper...what do you see?

She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.
After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in
the reflection of her face.  Cooper rumbles a low growl.  The
shape seems to be gaining definition.

RRRING!

Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her
sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (into phone)
          Hi.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
               (on the other end)
          I'm stuck here for another couple of
          hours.

Claire's smile fades.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Unless you need me to come home...

                     CLAIRE
          No, no.  It's fine.

Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection...

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          You sure?

...but the shape is gone.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses
intently on the screen.

ANGLE

It's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and
an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of
musical notes, parades across the screen.

                     QUEEN OF HEARTS
               (on computer)
          You lost!  Off with your head!

Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
solitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and
disappears into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of
red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
into:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through
the phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (straining to be heard)
          Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer.
          She's in 314...Well, could you check?

She plugs one ear.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother
          called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse
          me, how can you study with that?

The noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a
classical music station.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then
hears a different set of musical notes from the computer.
She stares at the screen, stunned.

ANGLE

The game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm
chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Kay.

Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past
several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish
rock and roll.

                     CLAIRE
          Jesus...

She bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is
chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no
one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down
the hall.  She follows him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

The foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire
nervously walks out and looks around.

                     CLAIRE
          Cooper!

POV - THE GARDEN

No sign of the dog.

Claire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the
doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow
draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly
into the study.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...?!

The whispering stops.

INT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT

Claire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD
STUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt
and tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming some
unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.
She stops by the door to watch him.

                     NORMAN
          ...and then what...Courtney?

An intense ASIAN GIRL answers.

                     COURTNEY
          We administer the Halothane.

                     NORMAN
          Dosage?

She glances at her notes.

                     COURTNEY
          Three point five cc's.

                     NORMAN
          Excellent.  Properties?  Andrew from
          downtown...

Andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.

                     ANDREW
          An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,
          which when administered in aerosol form
          temporarily renders the subject immobile.

                     NORMAN
          Nothing but net.

He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an
apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.

                     NORMAN
          Prudence here's an old friend.

He moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to
Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheep
suddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around and
begins a brief procedure.

                     NORMAN
          I try to stay on her good side because I
          owe her my career and most of our grant
          money.  Why else?

He completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly.

                     NORMAN
          Always do unto others as you'd have
          others do unto your ewe.

Groans, laughter.  He stops Claire.

                     NORMAN
          That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday!

Andrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave.  Claire
moves over to him.  They kiss.  Norman packs notes and some
of the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE.

                     NORMAN
               (warm)
          What are you doing here?

                     CLAIRE
          There were some noises.  I didn't want to
          disturb you.

She watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led
out of the room.

                     NORMAN
          What do you mean?  Some noises where?

                     CLAIRE
          In the house.  I was scared.

                     NORMAN
          Did you call the police?

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you
          back in the morning.

                     NORMAN
          Of course.

He takes her arm.

INT.  THE FOYER - NIGHT

Norman pushes open the front door.  Cooper pads over, wagging
his tail.  They walk together past the stereo into...

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

...the living room.  All is quiet.  They move into...

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

It's undisturbed.  Norman checks the window locks.

                     CLAIRE
          It was there.  This angry music all by
          itself.  And I heard whispering.

                     NORMAN
          What kind of whispering?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.  Just...whispering.

He nods as Cooper appears.

                     NORMAN
          What'd you see, Coop?

The dog stares blankly.

                     CLAIRE
               (to Cooper)
          Tell him!

Norman smiles.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes.

                     NORMAN
          I'm gonna have the police check on the
          house.

Claire leans against the window sill.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh great, "Can you look in on my wife,
          she's hearing voices?"  Wait'll that gets
          around.

He walks over to her.

                     NORMAN
          I've got the conference next week.  I want
          you to feel safe.

                     CLAIRE
          I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how
          was your day?

He goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box
in his dresser.

                     NORMAN
          Think I may have cracked it.

                     CLAIRE
          Really?

She produces a match and lights it.  They sit on the bed.

                     NORMAN
          I think so.  Maybe.

                     CLAIRE
          You are so brilliant.

                     NORMAN
          Yep.

                     CLAIRE
          Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman
          Spencer...

                     NORMAN
               (smiling)
          You know what that does to me.

She takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck.

                     NORMAN
               (stopping)
          Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw
          Schumway...

                     CLAIRE
          You're kidding.

                     NORMAN
          He's here giving some arcane spiel for
          the physics department, so Bob Shine
          introduces us...

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.

He nods, Claire passes the joint back.

                     NORMAN
          And he says...you'll fucking love this,
          he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great
          admirer of your work..."

                     CLAIRE
          Well, that's nice.

                     NORMAN
          "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          Oh, no...

                     NORMAN
          "...of Perpetual Distances."
               (beat)
          Everybody's checking their shoelaces.
          Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken
          me,"  I say...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          That's...

                     NORMAN
          "...for my father."

                     CLAIRE
          I'm so sorry.

                     NORMAN
          Didn't know he was dead, every stinking
          paper on the globe.

                     CLAIRE
          That's just mean.
               (indicating joint)
          Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get
          her some.

                     NORMAN
               (quickly glancing over)
          Did you tell her?

                     CLAIRE
          What?  No.  No.

                     NORMAN
          You didn't?

                     CLAIRE
               (with a smile)
          Norman, you are so funny about that.  No,
          I didn't.

He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Cause that would be really--

She lays back on the bed.  Sounds of flushing.

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't.

He reappears without the joint.

                     NORMAN
          Sorry.  You understand.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you call about the Feurs?

                     NORMAN
          Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a
          sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.

                     CLAIRE
          Huh.

Claire ponders this.  Norman turns off the light and joins
her on the bed.  He kisses her knee.

                     NORMAN
          Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.

Then starts working his way up her thigh.

                     NORMAN
          And speak up.

Claire smiles.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in
position.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow
to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.

Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a
beautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, very
good.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as her
left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.

She reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seems
almost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, and
again falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet
again, this time failing completely.

She sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as an
afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At the
end of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can just
make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.

She sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Each
time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finally
she plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoes
with a distinct, unsettling shriek.

CRASH!

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK

Claire walks in and sees:

INSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH
OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE.

The caption announces that he's being promoted to the
"distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS."  Through the
spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an
older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side.

Claire kneels down to gather the picture.  A single shard of
glass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctive
knot in the wood floor.

She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when
she moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of broken
glass on the frame and stands.

Out of the window directly in front of her sees:  Mr. Feur,
removing a DIRT COVERED SHOVEL from his trunk.  She glances
down at the picture, then back up at Mr. Feur, who carries
the shovel around back.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh no...

Claire wraps up the broken picture.  She hears a car door
slam and glances out the window in time to see Mr. Feur
driving off.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

A stiff autumn breeze.  Claire stands at the fence.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur?

She looks through the tiny crack.  Nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello?
               (beat)
          Are you there?

Silence.

EXT.  THE FEUR'S - DAY

Claire glances down as she walks past THE FURROW.  She looks
up at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads
around back.

EXT.  FEUR'S BACK PORCH - DAY

She takes in the lake view from the large porch.  The wind is
really blowing.  Her eye catches on something.  Propped
against the back door...

THE SOIL COVERED SHOVEL

Claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,
then knocks at the back door.  There's no answer.  She knocks
again.  Nothing.  She's turning to go, then the door swings
open.  The smile fades from Claire's face.

CLAIRE'S POV

The immense MR. FEUR filling the doorway.

                     MR. FEUR
          Yes?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...

                     MR. FEUR
          I'm running late here.  I just came back
          for my briefcase.

                     CLAIRE
          Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to
          welcome you to the uh, to the
          neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From
          next door.

                     MR. FEUR
          This really isn't a good time.

He starts to close the door.

                     CLAIRE
          Well maybe your wife...

                     MR. FEUR
               (growing cold)
          She isn't here.

                     CLAIRE
          When...when will she be back?

                     MR. FEUR
          I don't know.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh-kay...

                     MR. FEUR
          I have to go.

Slam.  And Claire is staring at a closed door.

                     JODY (V.O.)
          What do you mean she's gone?

EXT.  LAKE - DAY

Claire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the
Spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the OLD
LIGHTHOUSE, the BRIDE in the background.

                     CLAIRE
          She's not there.  I haven't seen her since
          that morning.  Well, I mean, I've never
          actually seen her, but I'm telling you,
          she's disappeared.

Jody finishes securing a line.  The breeze is mild, so they
just cruise with the wind.

                     JODY
          What are you saying?

Claire just looks at her.

                     JODY
          You think he killed her?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds
          crazy.  But what else could it all be?

Jody shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I mean, he's so kind of grim and
          daunting, and she sounded terrified of
          something.

Claire glances over at Jody.

                     CLAIRE
               (laughing to herself)
          Listen to me.  I sound like some middle-
          aged Nancy Drew.

Jody regards her.  After a beat:

                     JODY
          Know what I think?

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     JODY
          Seance.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, no...

                     JODY
          Telling you...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          ...no...no...no...

                     JODY
          Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.

                     CLAIRE
          Please.  That's all I need.

Jody shrugs, "Have it your way."  Beat.

                     JODY
          Hey, look.

CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake.

                     JODY
          So pretty.

CLAIRE'S POV

A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study.

                     CLAIRE
          Someone's there.

                     JODY
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          In the window.  Norman's at work.

                     JODY
          I don't...

Claire looks over at Jody.

                     CLAIRE
               (pointing)
          There.  In the study.  Don't you see--

She looks again-- nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.  I'm losing it.

                     JODY
          No, you're not.
               (beat)
          But a presence in your house is not
          something to be taken lightly.

Claire stares back at the house.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Claire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one
and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind
your pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them,
then freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh boy...

INT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

Claire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a
pair of BINOCULARS.

POV - BINOCULARS

Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past
their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON
DOWNSTAIRS.

The tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and
sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for
one.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring
straight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer.

Just then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a
screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her.

                     NORMAN
          What are you doing?

She glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing
at the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling
Norman with her.

                     CLAIRE
               (shrill whisper)
          Get down!  He'll see.

                     NORMAN
               (also whispers)
          What's going on, Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Shhhh.

She peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away
from the window.  She takes Norman by the hand and leads him
downstairs.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

She leads Norman in.

                     NORMAN
               (still whispering)
          Why am I...
               (full voice)
          Why am I whispering in my own house?

Claire turns.

                     CLAIRE
          He killed her.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          He did.  She's in the picture.  I went
          over to look and she's gone.  The table
          was set for one.

                     NORMAN
          And that means he murdered his wife?
          This is getting ridic--

                     CLAIRE
          No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel,
          his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from
          here, believe me, I...
               (frustrated, she grabs the
                photos)
          All right, look at this.

She triumphantly thrusts one before him.  Norman looks at it.

                     NORMAN
          Our house.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Look!  In the window.

The ROSES.  She points out a HAZY FIGURE in the TURRETED
WINDOW of the study.  Norman takes it over to the light.

                     NORMAN
          It's a flare.

                     CLAIRE
          A flare?

                     NORMAN
          From the sun.  It's a reflection on the
          glass.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered
          and turned on the music.  She's trying to
          contact me!

                     NORMAN
               (making sure he's got it)
          It's a ghost.

Norman shakes his head.  He looks again at the picture, does
a quick calculation.

                     NORMAN
          You took this in the morning, didn't you?

She nods slightly.

                     NORMAN
          When the sun would be exactly right.

She's got him.

                     CLAIRE
          Then why isn't it in any of the other
          pictures?

She thrusts the batch at him.  He peruses the other few shots
of the garden.

                     NORMAN
          A cloud passed.  Or it's a bounce off the
          lake.  See?

She looks.  He might not be wrong.

                     CLAIRE
          Where is she then?

                     NORMAN
          She could be out.  She could be sick in
          bed for all we know.

                     CLAIRE
          Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at
          this.

She leads him out of the room.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly.

                     CLAIRE
          See?

                     NORMAN
          What am I looking at?

                     CLAIRE
               (indicating completed solitaire
                game)
          I didn't do that.

                     NORMAN
          Who did?  Mrs. Feur?

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe.  Point is...not me.

                     NORMAN
          Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed
          her, why doesn't she haunt him?

                     CLAIRE
          She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman,
          I know how it looks, but--

                     NORMAN
          Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under
          some strain.  But there's no such thing as
          ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor
          did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why
          aren't you dressed?

                     CLAIRE
          Dressed?

                     NORMAN
          Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.

                     CLAIRE
          When?

                     NORMAN
          What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about
          it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our
          first date since...

                     CLAIRE
               (she seems confused)
          Oh.

                     NORMAN
          ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember
          this?

                     CLAIRE
          Tonight?

                     NORMAN
          Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--

She looks at his watch.

                     CLAIRE
          Fashionably five minutes late.

She bolts up the stairs.

INT.  NORMAN'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

They drive across the bridge.

                     NORMAN
               (concerned, exasperated)
          When you do this, I swear...

                     CLAIRE
               (overlapping)
          ...Don't get all...

                     NORMAN
          ...like it never even happened...

                     CLAIRE
          Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...

He pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number.

                     CLAIRE
          What are you doing?

                     NORMAN
          Restaurant.  Let them know we're running
          late.

                     CLAIRE
          Five minutes?

The phone flashes..."NO SERVICE."

                     CLAIRE
          You're not at the center.

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          I know I'm not at the center of the
          bridge.

                     CLAIRE
          We're going to be fine.

They near the far side of the bridge.  Norman looks down at
the cell phone, which now reads, "ROAM."  He presses a
button.

                     NORMAN
          There we go.

                     CLAIRE
          Well, that's a relief.

He shoots her a look.

INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A cozy, candlelit Italian place in town.  Claire and Norman
arrive at the table.  STAN rises.  The chair next to him is
empty.  He kisses her cheek.

                     CLAIRE
          Hi Stan.  Sorry we're late.
               (too earnest)
          It was my fault.

She greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties.

                     STAN
          We just got here.

Claire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          Where's the new squeeze?

A VOICE speaks out from behind her.

                     VOICE
          Here I am.

Claire turns to find A TALL, ELEGANT BRUNETTE standing behind
her.  The woman's face registers some shock.

                     STAN
          I'd like you to meet...

                     CLAIRE
          Elena?

                     ELENA
          Ohmigod...

The two women embrace, then beam at each other.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow.

                     ELENA
          This is...

                     CLAIRE
               (to Norman)
          We know each other.

                     NORMAN
          Hope so.

LATER

Post meal.  Several empty wine bottle decorate the table.

                     ELENA
          We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki,
          something.  He had these ridiculous bangs.
          And he'd sweep them off with his baton
          every minute or so, and it drove us
          insane, remember?

Claire nods.

                     CLAIRE
          He looked like one of the Monkees.

                     ELENA
          Anyway, Claire slept with him...

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't sleep with him.

                     ELENA
          ...just so she could cut them off.

                     CLAIRE
          He was so pissed.

                     ELENA
          I came in from my room...

                     CLAIRE
               (interjecting)
          We were suite mates.

                     ELENA
          And there's this brilliant conductor in
          purple briefs with no bangs cursing his
          ass off in Finnish.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...

They dissolve into giggles.  Norman and Stan smile.

                     STAN
          Well...

                     NORMAN
               (to Stan)
          I made an honest woman out of her.

Elena puts her hand on Claire's.

                     ELENA
               (to Stan)
          You should have heard her play.

                     CLAIRE
          Stop.

                     ELENA
          We both auditioned for the Philharmonic.
          One cello position open.

                     CLAIRE
          Do we have to?

                     ELENA
          And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I
          stood in the hallway and listened to her
          audition...and I cried.

                     CLAIRE
          She's making this up.

                     ELENA
          I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for
          weeks.

                     STAN
          What happened?

Elena looks at Claire, then smiles.

                     ELENA
          She got it.
               (beat)
          Turned it down.

                     CLAIRE
          I met a dashing young grad student after a
          recital one night...

Claire puts her arm around Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and three months later I was married.

He squeezes her hand.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to
her ear and a cup of Jody's special tea.  She sniffs it and
makes a face as she turns on the computer.  After several
rings a GIRL picks up on the other end.

                     CLAIRE
               (on phone)
          Caitlin?

                     GIRL'S VOICE
               (overlapping)
          Can you hang up?  I'm trying to make a
          call.

The line goes dead.  Claire hits redial and gets...a BUSY
SIGNAL.  She clicks the phone off as the computer boots up.
Claire puts the phone down and starts a game of Alice's
Solitaire.  She turns a card and waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Gee, that's tricky.  Sure could use some
          help.

She waits, the cursor blinks benignly.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...

Nothing happens.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAY

She walks into the room and notices STEAM wafting from the
cracked bathroom door.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

Claire enters the steamy bathroom.  The tub is nearly
overflowing with water.  She squats down to drain the tub.

She stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her...no
one's there.  Claire reaches toward the water to yank the
plug's chain, then freezes.  In the bathwater's still
reflection she see:

A PRETTY YOUNG BLOND standing beside her.  Startled, she pops
up and slams into the SHOWER HEAD.

Claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping
underwater.  A small cloud of red surrounds her.  Moments
later, an arm wraps around her.

                                                      CUT TO:

Blurry shapes.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Claire...

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

CLAIRE'S POV - A FACE sharpens into focus hovering above
her...Norman.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Claire sits on the bed.  Norman dabs the blood from a tiny
cut on the back of her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't need a shrink.

                     NORMAN
               (gently)
          Harvey says he's amazing.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman...

                     NORMAN
          What can it hurt to talk to someone?

She goes to her dresser and gets a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and
starts to open it.  Norman gently places a hand on her arm.

                     NORMAN
          Please.

She shoots him a look...

                     NORMAN
          You promised.

...and puts the pills down.

                     NORMAN
               (gently)
          Claire, she's been a huge part of your
          life for seventeen years.  If you weren't
          thrown off balance by this, then
          something would be wrong.

                     CLAIRE
          I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course
          I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I
          know what I saw and what I heard...and it
          wasn't some "symptom" of something...

                     NORMAN
          I never said...

                     CLAIRE
          ...and I don't think I'm some lonely,
          middle-aged woman cracking up.

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Are you lonely?

                     CLAIRE
          No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!

INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in
her lap, arms crossed.

                     DR. DRAYTON (O.S.)
               (a smooth, mellifluous
                baritone)
          Who's idea was it?

                     CLAIRE
          Mine.  His.  We both...thought...

She trails off.  Camera slowly pulls back to reveal, DR.
TIMOTHY DRAYTON, a stocky, light skinned black man in his
late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          I didn't want to come.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Then why did you?

                     CLAIRE
          Because he was worried about me.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Your husband?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.
               (beat)
          I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full
          of prozac so he can live out his life in
          peace.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you really think so?

                     CLAIRE
          No.

There's a pause.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Why is he worried?

                     CLAIRE
          Because, I don't know, because
          sometimes...sometimes I forget
          things...and ever since Caitlin left,
          ever since my daughter left for school,
          there've been...I fainted and...
               (beat)
          Why is this so hard?

Dr. Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red
FIREBALLS next to his chair.  He proffers it to Claire.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fireball?

                     CLAIRE
          You're joking.

He shakes his head.  She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it
into her mouth.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          It's hard because I'm a complete stranger
          and what we're talking about is
          incredibly personal.  Besides, the first
          time most people come here, a part of
          them is wondering if I'm gonna think
          they're crazy.

She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Don't worry, I'm required to have at
          least three sessions in order to commit.

Her eyes get a little wider.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Now that's a joke.

She manages an unsteady smile.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          I have some training at helping people
          through the stressful moments in life,
          one of which you may or may not be
          experiencing.  If you want to get some
          stuff off your chest, great.  If not...

He smiles and shrugs, "no problem."  She stares at him for a
moment.

                     CLAIRE
               (re: fireball)
          These are good.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Mm-hmm.

She studies him for a moment.

                     CLAIRE
          There's a ghost in my house.

He nods slightly, as if she's told him, "I have some
anxiety."  Claire goes on.

                     CLAIRE
          She finished my solitaire game and turned
          on the radio...she likes rock and roll.
          Angry rock and roll.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          How do you know it's a she?

                     CLAIRE
          I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She
          was filling the bathtub.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What does she look like?

                     CLAIRE
          Pretty.  She's a blond.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you have any idea who she is?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fine.

                     CLAIRE
          What do you think I should do?

He thinks for a moment, then:

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Try to contact her.

Claire nearly swallows her fireball.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Try to communicate with her somehow.

                     CLAIRE
          You think that'll help?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Can't hurt.  And I think it's important
          you find out what she wants.

Claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.

                     CLAIRE
          Are you humoring me?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Nope.

She seems satisfied by his sincerity.

                     CLAIRE
          How?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          I don't know.  My aunt used to use my
          uncle's old pajamas and a candle.

He stands.  Claire nods, then stands.  She smiles too.

                     CLAIRE
          Is this time okay?

He nods.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks in carrying a half-empty bottle of wine.  She
looks over at Jody, who turns off the lights.  Jody then
strikes a match and lights a LARGE CANDLE.  She unveils her
carved ANTIQUE OUIJA BOARD.

                     JODY
          Sit down here.

                     CLAIRE
               (nervous, jokey)
          Are we hoping the ghost is going to
          have to pee?

Jody turns to her, deadly serious.

                     JODY
          Isn't this where you saw her?

Claire's smile fades.  She nods.

                     JODY
          Then this is where she'll be.

They sit cross legged, the board between them.

                     JODY
          Place your fingers on the planchette.

                     CLAIRE
          The planchette?

                     JODY
          This.

Jody indicates the wooden pointing device.  Each woman grasps
an edge.

                     JODY
               (in a low voice)
          We wish to commune with the spirit of
          Mrs. Feur.
               (to Claire)
          What's her first name?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

Jody closes her eyes.  Claire follows suit.

                     JODY
          I call forth the entity that is haunting
          this house.

They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved.

                     JODY
          Mrs. Feur?

There's still no movement.

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing's happening.

                     JODY
          Shhh.

Jody focuses intently.
                     JODY
          Reveal yourself to us.

A long moment passes.  It's starting to seem like a bust.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.  Even Jody seems startled.

                     JODY
               (to the spirit)
          Who...who are you?

At first, nothing happens.  Then, slowly, the planchette
starts to move across the board.

                     CLAIRE
          Are you doing that?

Jody shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not doing that.

The planchette comes to rest on the letter "M."  Moments
later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on
"E."

                     CLAIRE
          Oh...

                     JODY
          M-E...

It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space
between "E" and "F."  The planchette stops on "F."  Jody
removes her fingers from the device.

                     JODY
          Mef?  What's Mef?

                     CLAIRE
          It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.

Suddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE
PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F...

                     JODY
          Shit...

Jody stumbles backwards, gasping.

                     JODY
          Did you see that?

Claire leans in.

                     CLAIRE
               (to ghost)
          What happened to you?

The CANDLE GOES OUT.

                     JODY
          Oh God...

Jody bolts.  Claire follows.

EXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the
work room.  She holds onto her arm.

                     JODY
          I have to go.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, wait.

Cooper's growling in the work room.  They look in.

                     JODY
          Claire, this is...this is...

Claire, transfixed, walks in.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with
letters at an amazing speed.

MEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF...

She hears the front door swing open.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody!

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the
Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway.  She turns and goes
back into the house.

CRASH!

She edges into...

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  She
drops to her knees over the picture.  This time THE GLASS IS
SHATTERED.  When she picks out the remaining shards, the
newspaper photo slides out.  Claire glances at the benign
news stories on the back.

She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack
in the floor boards by the knot.

CLAIRE'S POV

The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER
COIN in the crack.  It's too big to be a penny.

She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but
recoils.  A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which
she pops into her mouth.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Still sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to
clean up the remains of the seance.  She bends down to pick
up the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub
is again full to the brink of overflowing.

                     CLAIRE
          What do you want?!

Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.
There is only silence.  She reaches in to pull the plug,
nearly scalding her hand.  When she turns for a hand towel
she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:

                      "YOU KNOW"

She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.

EXT.  LAB BUILDING - NIGHT

Norman nods to a SECURITY GUARD as he leaves a darkened
university building.  He sees Claire standing at the foot of
the steps.

                     NORMAN
          What are you doing out here?

                     CLAIRE
          He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed
          her and--

                     NORMAN
          This is the Feur thing?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.

Norman's momentarily speechless.

                     NORMAN
          How do you know this?

                     CLAIRE
          We had a seance.

                     NORMAN
          Who did?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman,
          she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to
          leave.

                     NORMAN
          How did you--

                     CLAIRE
          Jody brought a Ouija board and we
          summoned her.

He regards her for a moment.

                     NORMAN
          Are you angry at me?

This stops Claire in her tracks.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     NORMAN
          Maybe you resent how busy I've been.

                     CLAIRE
          What are you...?  No.

                     NORMAN
          You know what I've got at stake with this
          paper.  You know that.  I can't help but
          think that you're doing this now to hurt
          me, or to sabotage me somehow.

                     CLAIRE
          Sabotage?

                     NORMAN
          Ever since the accident I've been
          worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

                     CLAIRE
          The accident...?

                     NORMAN
          But then you've been so much better...

                     CLAIRE
          Norman, this isn't about you.  This is
          something that's happening to me.  It's
          not to get even...and it's not some
          warped bid for attention.  Some strange
          things are happening in our house,
          whether you believe in them or not...

                     NORMAN
          Sweetheart--

                     CLAIRE
          No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in
          what's happening.  I don't want to, but I
          do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think
          that would be enough for you.

She turns on a heel and walks toward her car.

EXT.  CAMPUS - NIGHT

Norman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of
the concert hall next door.

                     NORMAN
          You're overreacting.

She turns on him.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't tell me how to react!

Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk.

                     NORMAN
          Keep your voice down.

                     CLAIRE
          I will NOT.

Some of the bystanders stop to watch.

                     CLAIRE
               (still loud)
          Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my
          mind...

                     NORMAN
               (looking around)
          Claire, please...

Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her
intensity.

                     CLAIRE
          ...But what if I'm not?  What if she died
          in terror and betrayal and some part of
          her can't move on while that's
          unresolved.  Can't you just...

Something behind him catches her eye.  She trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          Wow...

Claire walks past him toward the parking lot.

                     NORMAN
          Claire, please...

There's a dangerous energy to her walk.  People step out of
the way.

EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's
after.  MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his
old Buick.

                     CLAIRE
               (walking up)
          You!

He looks up at her.

                     CLAIRE
          You think you're smart, don't you?  You
          think you got away clean.  Well, I know
          you killed her.  You drowned her in the
          bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and
          I'm gonna find her, you murdering
          sonofabitch.

Mr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.  Norman arrives
at her side.

                     MR. FEUR
          Who?

                     CLAIRE
               (scoffing)
          Give me that shit.  Your wife.

                     MR. FEUR
          I didn't kill my wife.

                     NORMAN
               (to Mr. Feur)
          I'm sorry...

                     CLAIRE
               (over Norman)
          Then where is she?

He stares at both Spencers for a moment.  Then calls past
them.

                     MR. FEUR
          Honey...

Claire and Norman turn.  A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the
passenger seat.  She turns.  IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS
SEEN.  Claire looks sucker punched.

INT.  DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Claire sits back in the chair.  She looks drained.  A soft
rain taps against the windows.

                     CLAIRE
          And his face...it seemed so gentle, and I
          knew...in that second I knew that I'd
          imagined the whole thing.

Dr. Drayton takes this in.  She seems genuinely frightened.

                     CLAIRE
          What's happening to me?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Well, that's what we're here for.

He watches her calmly, some empathy on his face.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Whether you imagined it or not, you
          actually saw and heard things that
          frightened you...that gave you reason for
          concern.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes, but...

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Your friend saw them.

                     CLAIRE
          Isn't there something called group
          hysteria?

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You think you influenced her?

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that
          when all this was happening, I felt, some
          part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody
          needed me.  And the more I reached out to,
          it, the fuller it became.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You're saying you willed these events to
          happen?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know, I'm very confused right
          now.

Beat.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Did you ever find out what it wanted?

Claire remembers.

                     CLAIRE
          She said, "You know."  That I know.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Do you?

                     CLAIRE
          No.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What do you think?
               (beat)
          Guess.

Claire ponders this.

                     CLAIRE
          I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by
          someone.
               (beat)
          This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the
          emotions of a figment of my--

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Have you been hurt?

                     CLAIRE
          Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was
          injured, but...

                     DR. DRAYTON
          You were in an accident?

                     CLAIRE
          Last year.  I drove my car up a tree.
          Nothing serious, this...
               (she indicates her scar)
          ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked
          bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it
          scared the hell out of Norman.

Beat.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          How's your marriage?

Claire's eyes widen.

                     CLAIRE
          Listen, don't hold back.

Dr. Drayton smiles kindly.

                     CLAIRE
          Well, he's been amazing throughout this
          whole thing.  Patient and caring...
               (beat)
          I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his
          work, and...it's a very important time
          right now with all that.  But,
          sometimes...I mean with everybody, right?
          Sometimes it's like...

She trails off.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          That he doesn't...see me, or, you know,
          that I'm...that's something's wrong...with
          me.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          That can't feel good.

                     CLAIRE
          No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what
          you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry,
          but that's not it.  My marriage is fine.
          I've had some kind of "empty-nest"
          episode where I saw some things that
          weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm
          willing to deal with that.
               (beat)
          I just don't want to go conjuring
          problems where none exist.

Claire finishes her tirade.  Dr. Drayton lets her settle for
a moment.

                     DR. DRAYTON
          Fair enough.  But you should know that I'm
          far less concerned with whether things
          you saw "existed," than I am with why you
          saw them.

She takes in the ramifications of that.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire's carrying some cuttings into the house.  She hears a
knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...Mrs.
Feur.  The real one.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I wanted to apologize.

                     CLAIRE
          You do?

                     MRS. FEUR
          For scaring you like I did.  When I
          thought about what that must have seemed
          like that day...

                     CLAIRE
          And then you weren't there.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Right.  I'm sorry.

There's an awkward pause.

                     CLAIRE
          Would you like some iced tea?

                     MRS. FEUR
          Very much.

Claire leads her toward the house.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher.
She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Your house is so beautiful.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

                     MRS. FEUR
          And these roses.  They're much prettier
          up close.

She regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.  She seems skittish and
shy.

                     CLAIRE
          I...there's something I have to ask
          you.

Mrs. Feur waits.

                     CLAIRE
          That day...at the fence.  You seemed
          terrified.  I don't think I was imagining
          that.

There's a pause.  Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap.

                     MRS. FEUR
          No.

                     CLAIRE
          Of what?  What were you so afraid of?

                     MRS. FEUR
          You're going to think I'm crazy or
          something.

A tiny smile.

                     CLAIRE
          Not this week.

She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire.

                     MRS. FEUR
          Love.

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     MRS. FEUR
          Have you ever felt so completely consumed
          by a feeling for someone that you
          couldn't breathe?  That the time together
          is so passionate and consuming that you
          felt physical pain when they would leave?

                     CLAIRE
          Um...sure.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a
          metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I
          never dreamed anyone would hear me back
          there...
               (beat)
          I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's
          in Boston.  He brought my things up and
          pleaded with me to come home.

Claire is mesmerized.

                     MRS. FEUR
          You must think I'm pathetic.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  No, I don't.

                     MRS. FEUR
          I'm sorry that I frightened you like
          that.  But I was so touched by your
          concern.  I've been lonely here.
               (beat)
          Perhaps we could be friends.

Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman.

                     CLAIRE
          I would like that.

Mrs. Feur smiles at her.

INT.  VOLVO - NIGHT

Claire pulls up in front of a large NEW YORK HOTEL.

                     NORMAN
               (on a cell phone)
          ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for
          dinner.
               (to Claire)
          Sure you won't stay?

                     CLAIRE
          No, it's fine.  I'm fine.

                     NORMAN
               (tempting her)
          Really big bed.

She smiles and shakes her head.  Norman kisses her goodbye,
then grabs his bag from the backseat.

                     NORMAN
          Do I have everything?

                     CLAIRE
          Yep.

                     NORMAN
          Call ya later.

He starts to walk into the hotel.

                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
          And you glad you married me?

He turns.  She's standing next to the car.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Are you glad?  I'm glad.

Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (softly)
          You know I am.

                     CLAIRE
          Good.
               (She gazes at him, then
                softly)
          You sat in front...I saw you there...

Norman takes his cue.

                     NORMAN
          You were lost in the music...eyes
          closed...your chest heaving...

                     CLAIRE
          I felt you...looking through me...

                     NORMAN
          We walked all night...

                     CLAIRE
          You told me that I was...

He gently cups her chin in his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          ...that you were everything I'd ever
          dreamed of.

She smiles, kisses him warmly, then gets in the car.

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young
lives in motion.

INT.  DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire walks past a number of doors.  Music booms out of one,
shards of a conversation out of another.  Finally, she
arrives at a door that says "Fur is murder."  She smiles to
herself and knocks.  There's no answer.

                     DIFFERENT VOICE (O.S.)
          She's out.

Claire turns to find an attractive YOUNG MAN standing at her
elbow.

                     YOUNG MAN
          They're playing at CBGB's down on Bowery.
          Probably won't be back for awhile.  You
          her mom?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Who was playing?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Bitch.  Caitlin's band.

                     CLAIRE
               (stunned)
          Caitlin's band?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Yeah.  They're really good.  I would have
          gone, but I have a paper.
               (beat)
          And I'm not just saying that because
          you're a mother.

Claire nods slightly.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

She walks down the hall.

INT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

Claire moves past a huge, BLACK SKINHEAD DOORMAN into an
entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club.  She looks out
over the MOB OF SEETHING YOUNG PEOPLE, swaying to a pulsing
power-pop band.  PUNKS and CLUB KIDS push past her as they
move into the throng.  She looks up and her face changes.

CLAIRE'S POV

A shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a
jangly, but surprisingly melodic song.  Her eyes race across
the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated
GUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER...Caitlin.  She
rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES
CLOSED, SWAYING TO THE MUSIC.

Claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.
The song ends and Caitlin's eyes open.  She smiles for a
moment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire.  Panicked,
Claire ducks behind a pillar.

EXT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

The last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club.  A
couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place
standing on the Bowery late at night.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Mom?

She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
case on a strap over her shoulder.  There's an awkward pause.

                     CLAIRE
          That was very good.

                     CAITLIN
          Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you.
          But it never felt right.

                     CLAIRE
          Why?

Caitlin stares at the ground.

                     CAITLIN
          I didn't want to bring up memories.  I
          didn't want to do anything that might
          make you regret your choices.

Claire winces silently.

                     CAITLIN
          Besides, Dad would have freaked.

                     CLAIRE
          No, he wouldn't.

                     CAITLIN
          I think playing in a band called "Bitch"
          might put a dent in the whole "perfect
          family" thing.

                     CLAIRE
          That's not true.

                     CAITLIN
          Yes it is.  Can we please not do that?
          Please?  Cause it is.

Claire doesn't disagree.

                     CLAIRE
          He loves you very much.  He just--

                     CAITLIN
          I know he does.

Beat.  Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter.

                     CAITLIN
          Are you mad at me?

                     CLAIRE
          Listen to me.  The one thing in life that
          I definitely don't regret...is the choice.
          I made to be your mother.

They hug.  For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back.
Her eyes well up.

                     CLAIRE
          I miss you.

                     CAITLIN
          So much.

                     CLAIRE
               (laughing)
          It got so bad your father almost had to
          put me away.

                     CAITLIN
          What do you mean?

                     CLAIRE
          I started seeing things.

                     CAITLIN
          A ghost?

Beat.  Claire stares at her daughter.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you?

                     CAITLIN
          No.  But once I heard...

                     CLAIRE
          What?

                     CAITLIN
          Someone crying.  A girl.
               (beat)
          I thought I was crazy.

                     CLAIRE
               (quietly)
          Then we both are.

Caitlin nods.

INT.  PRESIDENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

...a large cocktail party.  The house is crowded with
PROFESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, and their SPOUSES.  PRESIDENT
TEMPLETON, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with
his WIFE, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties.

                     TEMPLETON
          There they are.

                     NORMAN
          You remember my wife, Claire.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
               (shaking hands)
          Of course.  You must be so proud.

                     CLAIRE
          I am.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
               (to Norman)
          Everyone's very anxious to shake hands
          with our newest academic celebrity.

She takes their coats.  Dean Templeton leads them in.

                     TEMPLETON
          Must've been some paper.  Your father
          would be very proud.

This seems to strike a nerve.

                     NORMAN
          Uh-huh.

Claire notices this and squeezes his hand.  Templeton leads
Norman into a large living room which is filled with
colleagues.  Several of them turn and begin clapping.  Others
follow suit.

EXT.  PATIO - NIGHT

Claire stands at a small bar.

                     CLAIRE
               (to bartender)
          White wine please.

She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate
conversation with each other.  She's speaking about something
astonishing.  He's rapt.

Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED
ALUMNUS holds forth.  He sees her and mouths, "I'm sorry."
He points to his watch and flashes five fingers.  She smiles
and nods.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Guess I'm not much of a medium.

She turns to see Jody.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody...

They hug.

                     JODY
          Are you okay?

                     CLAIRE
          I think so

                     JODY
          I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus,
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
          It's alright.

                     JODY
          I mess around with this stuff, but I
          never thought anything would happen.

Claire looks uncomfortable.

                     JODY
          Does Norman know?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, she's alive.

                     JODY
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her.
          She's really sweet.

                     JODY
          Then what was it?

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been
          on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident.
          And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--

                     JODY
          Something was there.  You saw it.

                     CLAIRE
          Did I?

                     JODY
          Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a
          guy, this Pakistani guy down in
          Hartford...

                     CLAIRE
          Hartford?

                     JODY
          And he's the real thing.  Specializes in
          cases like this, like yours.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to
          listen to me.  This is not something that
          I can do right now.  Whatever it was,
          it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.

                     JODY
          But Claire--

                     CLAIRE
          Please.

Jody recognizes her fragility.

                     JODY
          Okay.  Okay.

                     CLAIRE
          I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call
          you.

Jody nods as Claire walks off.

INT.  POWDER ROOM - NIGHT

Claire stands in the spacious powder room, checking her
makeup in the mirror.  Mrs. Templeton enters from the
bathroom.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          How're you holding up?

                     CLAIRE
          Just fine.  It's a lovely party.

The two women fix their makeup side-by-side in the mirror.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Norman was telling me the dream house is
          finally finished.

                     CLAIRE
               (nodding)
          Almost.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing
          so well.

Claire looks confused.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm sorry?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          I know how hard it can be sometimes.

Claire turns to her.

                     CLAIRE
          Uh-huh.  What can be?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Well, I don't think I've seen you since
          the reception at Dean Ackerman's last
          year.

Claire's still in the dark.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          For the Dupont Chair.
               (off Claire's look)
          I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I
          used to run from at Amherst.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          There was just...some tension.  You were
          upset.  I remember being concerned.

                     CLAIRE
          At the party.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Toward the end.  You remember?

                     CLAIRE
               (recovering)
          Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you
          know...We're fine.

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness,
          but we do have to stick together you
          know.

                     CLAIRE
          Who's that?

                     MRS. TEMPLETON
          The wives.

Beat.

                     CLAIRE
          Right.

Mrs. Templeton leaves.  Claire looks into the mirror.

                     CLAIRE (V.O.)
          What was it about?

EXT.  TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Claire and Norman walk toward the car.

                     NORMAN
          You don't remember?

                     CLAIRE
          When she said it, there was something
          familiar...but no.

He looks at her for a moment.

                     NORMAN
          You dropped a glass.

                     CLAIRE
          I...

                     NORMAN
          A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You
          started crying.  I tried to comfort you...

                     CLAIRE
               (something's triggered)
          In the living room...

                     NORMAN
          You shoved me away and ran out to the
          patio.  I took you home.

                     CLAIRE
          But why?  I can't understand how I could
          just completely--

                     NORMAN
          It was maybe a week after the accident.
          We were moving.  It was a hard time.

                     CLAIRE
          But I don't remember.

                     NORMAN
          Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

                     CLAIRE
          What's wrong with me?

He stops, takes her shoulders gently.

                     NORMAN
               (reassuring)
          Nothing.  Nothing at all.  It's been a
          hard year.  But you're better now.  And
          things are really looking up for us.  So
          let's try to enjoy that.
               (gently)
          Please?

She thinks for a beat.

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Yes.  That's what I want.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire walks up to the door.  When she touches the knob she
hears...the WHISPERING.  She opens the door and moves into:

INT.  FOYER - DAY

The same intense whispered exchange.  She glances into the
mirror and sees...SHAPES MOVING, BODIES, A FLASH OF SILVER.
She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

She walks in and stands before:

The repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party
for the DUPONT CHAIR.

She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then
SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the
picture from the broken glass.  The caption reads:

"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont
Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman."

She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over
and scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly
contested city council race, another contains details of a
large alumni donation to the university.

She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't
noticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but
it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  She
narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND.  A screen pops up with a
list of names.  She scrolls down the list until she
finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH.

                     CLAIRE
          M-E-F...

Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a
blurry cyber photo fills the screen.  Slowly, higher
resolution moves down the image.

IT'S THE GHOST.

Under the photo is the legend:

             "DISAPPEARED - OCTOBER 22, 1998"

Claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits PRINT.

LATER

Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out.

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          ...she was practically a townie.  Grew up
          in Bradford.

                     CLAIRE
          And she was never found?

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          Nah.  She was a live wire.  Had this old
          Mustang Fastback.  It's gone too.  Most of
          her friends think she's tooling around
          Mexico somewhere.  Police downgraded her
          to a runaway.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you, Mr...

She glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo.

INSERT

"by Neil McCann"

                     CLAIRE
          ...McCann.

She hangs up.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

Norman is unpacking NOTES and CHEMICALS from his LEATHER BAG.
Claire walks in.

                     CLAIRE
          Remember this?

She places the printout on his desk.  He takes a long look at
it.

                     NORMAN
          Is this that girl from last year?

Claire nods.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you know her?

Norman looks again.

                     NORMAN
          I may have seen her on campus.

                     CLAIRE
          Not personally.

                     NORMAN
          No.
               (beat)
          I'm afraid to ask what this is about.

                     CLAIRE
               (solemnly)
          It's her.  This is the woman who I've
          seen.

                     NORMAN
          The...

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  The ghost.

Norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window.

                     CLAIRE
          I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's
          not...

                     NORMAN
               (quietly overlapping)
          Stop...

                     CLAIRE
          ...I'm positive this time...

                     NORMAN
               (overlapping)
          ...Please stop...

                     CLAIRE
          It's Madison Fra--

                     NORMAN
          STOP IT!

Claire falls silent, Norman turns from the window.

                     NORMAN
               (calmly)
          Claire, I've tried to be there.  I know
          you're going through something that I
          can't understand...but it's enough.

Claire looks down.

                     NORMAN
          Do you want to go see someone?  Together?
          Should we call Dr. Drayton?

She shakes her head.

                     NORMAN
          Well then what?  Claire, what?  Tell me
          what I can do.

Long pause.  Claire looks up, then timidly holds out the
printout.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her.

Norman's jaw tightens.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't want to make you angry.  But she's
          here.  And I don't know why...

He silently walks out of the room.  Claire stares down at the
face in the photo.

EXT.  MADISON FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire parks in front of a small, clapboard house in a
neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own.
She gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Claire rings the bell.  A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early
fifties answers the door.

                     CLAIRE
          Mrs. Frank?

                     MRS. FRANK
          Yeah.

                     CLAIRE
          I'd like to talk to you about Madison.

                     MRS. FRANK
          You know where she is?

                     CLAIRE
          No, I don't.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Please leave me alone.

She starts to close the door.  Claire leans forward.

                     CLAIRE
          She's my friend.

The woman stops.

                     CLAIRE
          Was.  We were...acquainted.  I've been
          away for awhile.  When I came back...

She studies Claire.

                     MRS. FRANK
          What's your name?

                     CLAIRE
          Claire.

                     MRS. FRANK
          She never mentioned you.

Claire doesn't know what to say to this.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Then again, she didn't say much about her
          college friends.

She gives Claire the once over.

                     MRS. FRANK
          I'm watchin' my shows.

She motions Claire in.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

Claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room.  Mrs.
Frank serves up a mug of coffee.  A soap plays silently on an
old 19" RCA.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha
          nonsense.

                     CLAIRE
          It's fine.

She sizes Claire up.

                     MRS. FRANK
          You look a little old for a student.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not.  We...we met at a party.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Sounds about right.  Never understood how
          a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't
          get it from me.  They wanted to put her in
          a special school for the gifted when she
          was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.

                     CLAIRE
          She never mentioned her father.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was
          twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.

There's a silence.  Mrs. Frank stares at the TV.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Don't need the sound.  You can pretty much
          tell what's happening by the faces.  Turn
          it up sometimes, though.  Feels like
          someone's here.

Claire doesn't know what to say.  Mrs. Frank turns to her.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Why are you here?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

                     MRS. FRANK
          It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No
          note.  Nothing.
               (beat)
          Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna
          know what happened.

Claire stares at this tough, tragic woman.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Wanna see her room?

Claire nods.

INT.  MADISON'S ROOM - DAY

Claire enters the room.  Her face freezes.

SEVERAL POSTERS FOR ALTERNATIVE AND METAL BANDS, side by side
with ACADEMIC PLAQUES AND AWARDS.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She
          wanted to stay close.

                     CLAIRE
          You must have been very proud.

She nods.  Claire moves along looking at pictures.  Some with
different men, others with rough looking friends.  Claire
stops at a picture tucked into a mirror.

INSERT

Madison singing at a recital of some kind.  She's lovely,
with striking GREEN EYES.  Around her neck is a distinctive
SILVER NECKLACE, with a perfectly wrought, SILVER ROSEBUD.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Such a pretty voice.  Surprised she didn't
          major in music.
               (beat)
          That's the last picture.

A phone rings in the hallway.

                     MRS. FRANK
          S'cuse me.

Claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the
reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin
board.  She turns and moves over to:

A SHORT BLOND BRAID.  She reaches out to touch it.  Claire
hears footsteps.  Mrs. Frank leans back into the room.

                     MRS. FRANK
          They're calling me in to work.

                     CLAIRE
          I should be going anyway.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Mrs. Frank walks Claire out.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Y'hear anything you'll let me know?

                     CLAIRE
          Of course.

Claire walks to her car.  She turns and calls out:

                     CLAIRE
          What was her major?

                     MRS. FRANK
          Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.

Claire stands, frozen, as Mrs. Frank disappears into the
little house.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

Claire shuts the blinds, then places the large candle on the
floor, then places the MISSING GIRL PRINTOUT at the base of
the candle.  On top if it, she places THE BRAID.

Then Claire lights the candle, puts the braid on the picture,
and hunches over it, whispering intensely:

                     CLAIRE
          I need to know the truth.

She waits a beat.  Nothing.

                     CLAIRE
          Madison, please...help me.

Nothing happens.  She looks around at the seance props.

She stands and places her hands on the sink.  She glances at
herself in the mirror.

                     CLAIRE
          What am I doing?

Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.  When
she looks back into the mirror, her eyes are a DEEP GREEN.
She hears the front door open downstairs.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Hello...Anybody home?!

A strange smile creeps across her face.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

POV - Gliding down the stairs and into...

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

The refrigerator door is open.  Norman is leaning over.  Only
his ass protrudes.

REVERSE

Norman closes the refrigerator door and sees Claire standing
before him, stripped down to a skirt and slip top.  There's a
different physicality to her movements...a different rhythm
to her speech.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello, Dr. Spencer.

Norman smiles.

                     NORMAN
          Mrs. Spencer.

She shakes her head.

                     CLAIRE
          Forbidden fruit...

She takes the apple...

                     CLAIRE
          Got a problem with that...

...then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

Norman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread.

                     NORMAN
          I take it your not mad at me.

                     CLAIRE
          Wouldn't go that far.

She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the
apple to his mouth.  Norman tentatively takes a bite.  She
mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly.

                     NORMAN
               (mouth full)
          Okay...

When he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs
down his chin.  Claire leans forward and licks it off.

                     NORMAN
          What's gotten into you?

She just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him.  It
looks like she's eating his lips.  Norman's getting hot.  She
bites down on a lip.

                     NORMAN
          Ow!

                     CLAIRE
          What's the matter?

                     NORMAN
          It's too rough.

                     CLAIRE
          Since when?

Something about this response frightens him.  Claire yanks
Norman's belt open.  He steps back, tripping over his
castered desk chair.  She's on top of him in a flash, sitting
astride him.  She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper.

                     NORMAN
          I don't like this, this...

                     CLAIRE
               (pinning his hands above his
                head)
          Why don't you shut up and fuck me,
          Professor.

She grinds up against him.  Suddenly, something pulls her eye
to the hallway.

POV - The COAT RACK MIRROR, now from inside the study.  In
it's reflection:  ANOTHER CLAIRE, shorter hair, stunned
expression.  Where she's standing...it's DAYTIME.

Claire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose.

                     CLAIRE
               (tense whisper)
          I think she's starting to suspect
          something.

                     NORMAN
               (through clenched teeth)
          Who?

                     CLAIRE
               (leaning down)
          Your wife...

                     NORMAN
          STOP IT!

Norman shoves her off of him onto the floor.  He stands,
breathless.

                     NORMAN
          What the hell are you doing?!

In a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against
the wall.

                     CLAIRE
               (to herself, remembering)
          "You know..."

                     NORMAN
               (rattled)
          What?

She looks up.

                     CLAIRE
          I was there.

                     NORMAN
          Claire--

                     CLAIRE
               (flooding back to her)
          I came to work in the garden and I saw
          you with her...in my house.

                     NORMAN
          Oh God...

                     CLAIRE
          I snuck back to my car, trying to
          convince myself it never happened.  And
          when I woke up in the hospital...somehow
          it hadn't.  Until now.

He just stares at her, his face anguished.

                     NORMAN
          It was last year.  We were having
          troubles.

                     CLAIRE
          So you fucked a student?!

                     NORMAN
               (reaching for her)
          That's not what I'm sayi--

                     CLAIRE
               (pulling back)
          DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me.
          Go!

He's frozen.

                     CLAIRE
          I SAID GET OUT!

Norman doesn't move.  He's never seen her like this.

                     CLAIRE
          Fine...

She bolts toward the living room.  He follows her.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She grabs her coat.

                     NORMAN
               (welling up)
          Claire, please don't...

                     CLAIRE
          What did you think I would do?  Jesus
          Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...

                     NORMAN
          I never asked you to quit!

                     CLAIRE
          ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect
          Daddy and that meant perfect wife,
          perfect family...

He follows her as she searches for her purse and keys.

                     NORMAN
          THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And
          then when you did, you hated me for it...
          so you gave it all to her.

                     CLAIRE
          Who?

                     NORMAN
          To Caitlin!!

She wheels on him with fury.

                     CLAIRE
          Leave her out of this!

                     NORMAN
          And then out of nowhere, some bright
          young woman found me attractive...

                     CLAIRE
          Stop...

                     NORMAN
          ...would do anything just to be around
          me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I
          slipped.

                     CLAIRE
          I'm not going to listen to this.

Claire goes to leave, Norman blocks her path.

                     NORMAN
          I tried to break it off!

                     CLAIRE
          You should have tried harder.

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

                     CLAIRE
               (seething)
          Get out of my way.

She brushes past him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

He catches up, beside himself.

                     NORMAN
          PLEASE DON'T GO!

Claire's nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst.
She turns at the door and looks back.

                     CLAIRE
          You made it impossible for me to be
          someone you could be in love with.

She leaves.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Norman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a
half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table.  He
awakens to find Claire sitting across from him.

                     CLAIRE
          I want you to answer one question.

He waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Did you have anything to do with her
          disappearance?

Beat.

                     NORMAN
          Yes.

Claire goes pale.

                     NORMAN
          She was damaged and unstable.  The more I
          tried to distance myself, the more
          desperate she became.  Finally, she showed
          up at the new house...

                     CLAIRE
          How did she know where it was?

He stares off.  The reality sinks in for Claire.

                     CLAIRE
               (softly)
          Our dream house.

Norman can hardly look at her.

                     NORMAN
          She was out of control.  She said she was
          going to kill herself...or you.  I never
          thought she'd go through with any of it,
          but then she was gone...

He trails off.

                     CLAIRE
          She did it.

                     NORMAN
          We don't know that for sure.

                     CLAIRE
          Of course she did, Norman.  What else
          could it be?

The enormity of this hits Norman.  His head drops into his
hands.

                     NORMAN
          Oh God, what have I done?  How could I
          have let this into our lives?

He looks up at her, teary.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

She gets up and walks out of the room.

EXT.  JODY'S STUDIO - DAY

An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished
oil paintings.  Jody brings Claire some tea.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and everything I have, everything I
          thought my life was...Christ when I think
          of all the lies...

Jody looks down.

                     CLAIRE
          What?
               (beat)
          Jody what?

Jody looks up, tears in her eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...you knew.

                     JODY
          I was down in Adamant...

                     CLAIRE
          Adamant?

                     JODY
          Artsy little village down seven.  There's
          a guy there who sells my work.  I had just
          dropped off some paintings and as I got
          in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this
          little cafe.

Claire waits for her to continue.

                     JODY
          I started to walk over...but he wasn't
          alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse.
          She was young.
               (beat)
          I should have said something right away.
          But I didn't.

                     CLAIRE
          Why?

                     JODY
          Partly because I didn't want to hurt
          you...but partly...partly because I was
          relieved.

                     CLAIRE
          Relieved?

                     JODY
          I had just been left by Richard.  I was
          bitter and miserable and for some fucked
          up reason, it made me feel better that
          your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.

Claire nods.

                     JODY
          By the time I finally got up the nerve to
          tell you, Stan called from the hospital
          and it was too late.

                     CLAIRE
          Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.

                     JODY
          Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of
          Valium in your system?

Claire walks over to a window.

                     JODY
          I got there first.  Stan covered up the
          pills and I had it out with Norman.  He
          seemed desperate not to lose you.  He
          promised to handle it.  And we all let it
          drop away.

                     CLAIRE
          All of us.

Beat.

                     JODY
          I'm a terrible friend.

                     CLAIRE
          No.

Claire turns.

                     CLAIRE
          How could I expect you to tell me
          something that I wouldn't even tell
          myself?

                     JODY
          What are you going to do?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know.

                     JODY
          If she was dangerous before--

                     CLAIRE
          She could have hurt me if she wanted to.

                     JODY
          You don't know that.
               (beat)
          If it's your belief that gives her form,
          then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow
          you have to break the connection.

                     CLAIRE
          No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now
          that I do...I think she's at peace.

Jody isn't as sure.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Claire walks in.  She notices the clock on the range is dark.
She flips on a light.  Nothing happens.  Worried, she heads
upstairs.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - MORNING

Claire enters.  The bed is empty.  The shower is running in
the bathroom.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman?

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

ANGLE - CLAIRE...her face a mask of terror.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...

CLAIRE'S POV

The BATHTUB, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the
water blasting.  Norman's limp hand pokes through the
curtain.  AN ELECTRIC CORD leads from the mirror socket into
the tub.

Claire races over and rips the plug from the wall.  She tears
the SHOWER CURTAIN AWAY to find A BLUISH NORMAN lying,
unconscious in the tub.

                     CLAIRE
          No, no.  Please no...

She hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a
heartbeat.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman!!  Wake up!  Please!

Claire shakes him to no effect.

                     CLAIRE
          Oh God...NORMAN!

She slaps him on the face...once, then twice.  He suddenly
sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns
to life.

                     CLAIRE
          It's me...it's me...

Sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to
pull him upright.  She discovered HER BLOWDRYER in the tub
and hurls it across the room.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Claire sits beside Norman on the bed as two E.M.T.'s, an OLD
GUY and a HEAVY WOMAN pack up.  Stan's on the phone, Jody off
to one side.

                     HEAVY WOMAN
          Vitals are good.  I'd take it easy for a
          couple of days.

                     NORMAN
          Thanks.

The E.M.T.'s leave as Stan hangs up.

                     STAN
          They'll take you for a CAT scan tomorrow
          if you're feeling dizzy at all.

                     NORMAN
          That won't be necessary.   

He glances at Claire as he walks Stan out.

                     NORMAN
          Not unless there's a miracle drug for
          clumsiness.

They leave.

                     CLAIRE
          Jody, she tried to kill him.

                     JODY
          I know.

                     CLAIRE
          I can't believe this is happening.

                     JODY
          We need help.  Please let me call the
          medium.

                     CLAIRE
          That could take days.  I need to do
          something now.  Don't you see?  She wants
          us dead.

Jody thinks for a moment.

                     JODY
          Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened
          this door.  There's got to be a way that
          you can close it.

                     CLAIRE
          Like what?

                     JODY
          I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just
          making this up...

                     CLAIRE
          What is it?

                                                      CUT TO:

MADISON'S SMILING FACE

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Claire's staring down at the PRINTOUT.  She's kneeling at the
edge of the dock.  From her pocket she produces THE BLOND
BRAID and a piece of TWINE.  She wraps the braid up in the
printout with a rock and secures it with the twine.

                     CLAIRE
          Sorry.  Better or worse, he's mine.

She tosses the little parcel into the dark water.  Bubbles
stream up.  In the bubbles, Claire sees...THE PALE SHAPE,
which slowly becomes THE DROWNED GIRL, staring up from
beneath the dark water.

Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.  Madison
reaches up toward the surface.  As the bubble diminish, she
seems to be FADING AWAY.  When she's gone, Claire reaches out
toward the water.  When her finger touches the surface...

WHOOSH!  She's sucked down into the water.

INT.  UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM - DAY

Norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off
the dock.  He races out of the room.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her
deeper into the murky depths.

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Norman sprints toward the dock.

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as
her hand plunges into the muddy bottom.

Suddenly, she's released.  She yanks her hand free, the silt
swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud.

NORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards.

EXT.  DOCK - DAY

Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock.  They hold each
other.

                     NORMAN
          Are you okay?

She nods, catching her breath.

                     NORMAN
          We have to get out of here.

                     CLAIRE
          It's alright.

                     NORMAN
          Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.

                     CLAIRE
          She's gone.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          She can't be here without me.

                     NORMAN
          How can you be sure?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know, but I am.  She was there and
          then she was gone.  I felt it.

                     NORMAN
          Claire...

She stares into the still water.

                     CLAIRE
          It's over.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her.  Norman
walks in with some steaming mulled cider.  He stokes the
blazing fire.  He sits on the edge of the bed.

                     NORMAN
          I know it's going to take awhile before
          things are back...until they're better
          than before.  But you've given us a chance
          to make a fresh start.  And I'm going to
          spend the rest of my life making you glad
          that you did.

The gaze at each other.  Tentatively, she places a hand on
his.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her
rosebushes for the winter.  She picks up a basket of clipped
flowers and heads inside.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering.  All
is quiet.

INT.  FOYER - DAY

She looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the
lake behind it.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in
doing so, accidentally knocks it over.

With a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the
wooden floor.  The stream has flowed over to the knot and
dripped into the crack.  Claire stares down at THE STRANGE
COPPER COIN.

She grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the
coin out.  It's actually a SMALL BRASS KEY, the head of which
is THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES.  She stares at it for a
moment, then places it in her pocket.

EXT.  SAILBOAT - DUSK

Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.  The leaves
on the surrounding hills are stunning.  Norman appears beside
her.

                     NORMAN
          Last sail of the year.

She gazes out.

                     CLAIRE
          The leaves...

                     NORMAN
          Incredible.  We should take a drive before
          they're gone.  Spend the night at some
          cozy little bed and breakfast.

                     CLAIRE
          Look for antiques...

                     NORMAN
          Yep.  There's some great places nearby.

                     CLAIRE
               (a reflex)
          Adamant.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          Little village down seven.  Supposed to be
          charming.

                     NORMAN
          Huh.

                     CLAIRE
          Do you know it?

                     NORMAN
          Don't think so.

                     CLAIRE
          Maybe we can stop there for lunch.

He wraps an arm around her.

                     NORMAN
          Whatever you'd like.

She leans against him, staring out.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

Jody and Claire return from a walk.  Norman has the boat on
the trailer and is securing a tarp over it.  They stop under
a tree.

                     CLAIRE
          But he acted like he'd never heard of it.

                     JODY
          Did he say that?

                     CLAIRE
          Jody he was lying.

                     JODY
          What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to
          bring that up again just when you're
          trying to make a new start?

                     CLAIRE
          I guess not.

                     JODY
          He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.
          You should too.

Norman smiles and waves.  They wave back as they arrive at
the Karman-Ghia.

                     JODY
          You've got a beautiful life.  And even
          with this, it's always been clear that he
          loves you.
               (beat)
          I've come to think that's all that really
          matters.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know...

                     JODY
          Trust me, Claire.  You hear something...
          change the subject.  You find something...
          get rid of it, throw it in the lake.
               (beat)
          You know what happened.  The rest is only
          details.  And no one's ever glad they got
          a hold of those.  If you want to put this
          back together...just let it go.

Jody drives off.  Claire walks over to Norman.  She hugs him
tightly.

                     NORMAN
          What's that for?

                     CLAIRE
          Nothing.

                     NORMAN
          I'm cooking you dinner.

                     CLAIRE
          You don't have to do that.

                     NORMAN
          I know.

                     CLAIRE
          Fine.  I'll do the shopping.

They kiss.  She heads to the Volvo.

INT.  VOLVO - DAY

Claire is approaching a country market.  She spots a little
sign with an arrow:

                     ADAMANT - 11 mi.

She hesitates for a moment, then take the turn.

EXT.  ADAMANT - DAY

Claire stands on a street in the quaint little village.  She
looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.  A
friendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store.  She watches
Claire gazing around.

                     HIPPIE WOMAN
          What are you looking for?

                     CLAIRE
          I don't really know.

                     HIPPIE WOMAN
          Know what you mean.

She ambles off across the street.  Claire watches her go.
Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  THREE
INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  She walks toward it.

EXT.  SHOP - DAY

Claire stands in front of the store window.  A sign in the
window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought
jewelry and gifts."  Claire tries to open the door, but sees
a closed sign.

She steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display
are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.

Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
intricate ROSEBUD.

Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display
where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.  Protruding
from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  Claire looks like
she's been punched.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman.  She
gingerly slides out of bed.

INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT

Claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album,
tracking the years of their life.  Her hands tremble.
Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches
behind the photo and produces...THE KEY.

EXT.  DOCK - NIGHT

Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the
dock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.
She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.

She holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm
lies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and
stands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her
once...then again.

Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,
then carefully places it on the dock.  She very deliberately
takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the
dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps
off the dock.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

AN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs.  Norman bolts upright in
bed.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT

Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit
room.  He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting
closed on his desk.  He looks around, sees the room is empty
and walks over to it.

The mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is
engraved:  To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F.

He pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside.

THE LIGHTS SWITCH ON.

Claire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD
NECKLACE.

                     CLAIRE
          Looking for this?

Norman stares at her dumbly.

                     CLAIRE
          She's out there isn't she?  She's in the
          lake.

                     NORMAN
          Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what
          this is.

                     CLAIRE
          Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING
          NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!

                     NORMAN
               (nearly hysterical)
          I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus.
          Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she
          was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On
          my life!  She took pills and she killed
          herself in our house to destroy me!  To
          destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here
          before school, the painters would have--

                     CLAIRE
          I don't believe you.

                     NORMAN
          IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe
          me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!
               (beat, fighting tears)
          I did what I had to, Claire.  She was
          gone.  There was nothing I could do for
          her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I
          rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.
               (beat)
          And I've lived with that image ever since.
               (beat)
          I couldn't just stand there while
          everything-- my career, us,
          everything, just washed away.  Don't you
          see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is
          exactly what she wants you to think!

Claire's lip is quivering with confusion.

                     CLAIRE
          I don't know what's true anymore.
               (beat)
          But that girl must be brought up.  Now do
          you want to call the police?  Or should I?

Norman stares at the phone.  He's a wreck.

                     NORMAN
          Fine.  I can't live with it anymore.

He takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits.

                     NORMAN
          This is Dr. Norman Spencer.  No, it's not
          an emergency.

He looks at Claire.

                     NORMAN
          I have some information about a missing
          girl, Madison Frank...Yes.  Could you send
          an officer?  Fifteen Willoughby, about a
          mile before the bridge...Thank you.

He hangs up.  Long silence.  They look at each other.

                     NORMAN
          You did the right thing.
               (beat)
          I'm going to get cleaned up.

He walks out.  Claire walks over and stands before the box.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire walks into the bedroom.  The shower can be heard
through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  Steam
drifts out through the crack.

She stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her
weary, distraught countenance in the mirror.  She glances
down.

CLAIRE'S POV

The necklace still in her hand.

She looks up again into the mirror.  Her face goes strangely
blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto
her neck.

Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the
bed for a long moment.  She walks over, picks up the phone
and looks at it.

CLAIRE'S POV

The redial button.

She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button.  Two
rings, then:

                     VOICE
               (on phone)
          Directory assistance...

Claire's eyes widen in terror.  She clicks off the phone,
and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the
hall.  She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom.  She
quietly pulls open the hallway door.

Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.

Claire shoves Norman's hand away and runs past him down the
hall.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

She's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to
falter.  She tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters
down the stairs before her.

Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
Norman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the
Halothane to take its full effect.  Finally, she freezes.
Norman picks up the phone and stands over her.

                     NORMAN
          God, how did we come to this?

He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her
slowly up the stairs.

                     NORMAN
          The ghost stuff, that was impressive.

CLAIRE'S POV

Ceiling, shapes...

                     NORMAN
          I figure you saw her that day in the
          house and just gradually intuited the
          whole damn thing.  That would be pretty
          astonishing.  A passive-aggressive
          masterpiece.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

And into the bathroom.

                     NORMAN
          Wasn't until the shower that I realized
          you actually believed it.  Nearly froze to
          death waiting for you.  Thought the
          circuit breaker would kick back over and
          I'd be toast.

...then she's lowered into the tub.

                     NORMAN
          The crazy thing is...I have never for one
          moment stopped loving you.

He actually wipes a tear from his eye.  He kisses her lips.
We can feel her revulsion.  His face over her.

                     NORMAN
          Don't worry about Caitlin.  I'm sure in
          some tragic way this'll bring us closer
          together.

He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of
vision.  Sound of a number being dialed.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          Hey, it's Norman.  Listen, we had a huge
          blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at
          the lab.  I guess you're out, but...
          maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by
          to check on her in the morning?

She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a
prescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label.
Her eyes go wide.

                     NORMAN (O.S.)
          It's just...Jody, it's bad.  I've never
          seen her like this...
               (he trails off, choking up)
          I don't really know what to do anymore.

Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house
beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.

                     NORMAN
          If anything ever happened to her, I'd...
               (beat)
          Anyway, thanks.

Claire, mute, glances frantically around.  One of her fingers
begins to flutter.

                     NORMAN
               (tearfully)
          I'm so sorry.

The tub is rapidly filling.  He checks his watch, then
reaches for the Valium.  As much from will as the drug
beginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry.

                     CLAIRE
               (sloppy, guttural)
          Mmmuh...

                     NORMAN
          Shhhh.

                     CLAIRE
               (slurry)
          Mauduh...

Norman stops.

                     NORMAN
          What?

                     CLAIRE
          MADISON!

Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief
in the ghost.

                     NORMAN
          That's a little much, don't you think?

He sees the necklace on her neck.

                     NORMAN
          Oops.  Can't have that.

He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around
Claire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close
on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.

NORMAN'S POV

His arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.

Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS
SHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before
collapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above
Claire's nostrils.

Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and
yank it free.  The water slowly descends.

When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally
clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of
air.

The drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's
unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She
turns off the water and stands unsteadily.

She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little
antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls
the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's
been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out
of the room.

INT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

She fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks
at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty.

She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles
through the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open
to see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the
phone.  Then another.  It's blood.

She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring
down from the landing.

She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in
her hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself
over the banister.  THUD!

A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the
corner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last
moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles
over on Norman.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S
PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.

She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in
the bed...nobody there.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

The truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares
at the door for signs of Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...come on...

...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel
as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway,
constantly watching the door.

When she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks
into the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the
open door, then clears.  Still nothing.

EXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the
ancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge.

INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT

ANGLE

Claire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the
reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across
the windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in
911.  It blinks:  "NO SERVICE."

                     CLAIRE
          Shit.

She glances into the rear view mirror.

CLAIRE'S POV

A stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping
in the breeze.

Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again..."NO
SERVICE."  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks
again:  "ROAM."  Claire punches the talk button again.

SMASH!

A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm
follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim
visage pressed against the glass.

She squashes down the accelerator.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the
pickup.  Claire chokes, then blacks out.

EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling
over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP.

The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled
through the rear window and into the passenger side
dashboard.

INT.  PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER

Claire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of
blood runs from her nose.  Norman stirs briefly as Claire
groggily comes to.  She hears the hissing of the smashed
radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the
floor of the cab.

She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and
realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND
TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into
the water.

Before she can get the door open, the truck is half
submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window
halfway and starts to pull herself out.

Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks
onto her ankle and yanks her inside.  Norman pulls her down
until they're face to face.

                     CLAIRE
          Norman...NO...

She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the
submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp.
The truck is nearly submerged.

                     CLAIRE
               (desperately)
          Norman, please...

The water is up to the windows.  Norman shakes his head
slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes.

                     CLAIRE
          Think of Caitlin...

Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and
momentarily blinds Norman.  Claire jerks free and scrambles
out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks.

Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  She
looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand
clamped onto her ankle.

There is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurches
downward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.  The boat buoys it
like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake.

The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater
drop off.  Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not
letting go.

Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights
reveal...

MADISON'S SUBMERGED MUSTANG

SMASH!

When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car,
the Mustang's windshield shatters.  A PALE SHAPE FLOATS
UPWARD.

Norman is suddenly entangled by something.  He tries to brush
it free but comes face-to-face with MADISON'S GHASTLY,
DECOMPOSED FACE.  The last of his air bellows out of him in a
scream as he releases Claire's ankle.

His dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck
slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom.

EXT.  LAKE - DAWN

Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air.

                                                      CUT TO:

UNDERWATER - DAWN

The sound of a furious cello solo.

COLD STARING EYES

Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating.

Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered
to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle.

Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed
back.  As she twists into view...

MORPHS INTO:  MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace.

Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the
distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach.

                                                      CUT TO:

FINGERS

...filled with moist earth.  A hand tosses the clump of dirt
onto...

EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY

A CASKET

Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from
the grave.  A tiny arm snakes around her waist.  She glances
down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother
tightly.  Claire takes a last look into the grave.

                     CLAIRE
          Rest in peace.

THE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK

Mother and daughter turn and step back.  Next to them, also
in black, is MRS. FRANK.

                                                      CUT TO:

FINGERS

Racing across the neck of a cello.  The solo continues and
now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire
before.

WIDEN TO REVEAL

INT.  A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Claire, her hair short and sexy, eyes tightly shut, brow
beaded with sweat.  The piece builds to a dark, passionate
crescendo.

Her eyes remain shut for a moment, then flutter open.

CLAIRE'S POV

A New York apartment, the glimmering skyline visible through
a large window.  Cooper gazes up attentively.

Claire sips a glass of wine, her face unsmiling, but serene.

                                                    FADE OUT.

                           THE END
WHILE SHE WAS OUT

    MAP GRIDS

    From the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re-
    configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of
    American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories
    marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of
    forest and wilderness.

    Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a
    transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of
    the suburb. The name of this housing development is "Pleasant
    Valley". The transparency fades out to reveal:

1                                                                 1
    EXT.   PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING

    From a sign reading "Pleasant Valley Dream Homes", a picture
    postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity.

    Each home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same
    shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an
    indistinguishable car parked in the driveway.

    All the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees
    with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at
    the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths.

    The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer
    in the lights.

    We halt outside one house.

2                                                                 2
    EXT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

    This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas
    star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting
    itself in a puddle on the wet lawn.

    Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl
    among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the
    tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse
    from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified
    shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with
    it's prey into the woods behind.

    Curtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man
    appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He
    draws the curtains once again and disappears.

3                                                                 3
    INT. DELLA'S HOUSE/ KENNETH'S MEDIA ROOM - EVENING

    We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office
    fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer.

                                                Scene 3 Page 2
       

        KENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face,
        pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are
        glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll
        endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up
        abruptly from his chair elated.

                            KENNETH
                  Yes!

        Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His
        ebullient mood changes quickly.

                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
                  Damn! DELLA!

        The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening.
        DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her
        thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent.
        She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans.

        She sees the broken doll.

                            DELLA
                  SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's
                  favorite doll.

        She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed
        face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of
        beer.

                            KENNETH
                  You should just swear properly and
                  get it over with. Do you think the
                  kids don't know what you mean?

        Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks
        too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him,
        continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.

                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
                  Going out again? What is it
                  tonight? Auto Mechanics for
                  Dummies? The bored housewives'
                  reading group?

        He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look
        at her once more.

                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
                  I got a new one for you.

        He smiles sardonically.

                                                Scene 3 Page 3
       


                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
                  Group therapy for women who always
                  have the curse. There's a Tuesday
                  night class at the Pleasant Valley
                  Episcopalian.

        Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at
        him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping
        from her mouth.

                            DELLA
                  I'm going to the mall for wrapping
                  paper.

        A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches
        Kenneth's eye.

                            KENNETH
                  What do you do all day, Della
                  honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping
                  house. This place is an eyesore.
                  I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs
                  for this?

        His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined
        not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain
        himself, faces her.

                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
                  I mean it's not like you're at some
                  salon fancying up your hair or
                  nails like the other men's wives.

        He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop,
        looks right in her tired face.

                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
                  The last time I saw you wearing
                  something sexy was our engagement
                  party. God, Della, you used to be
                  hot!

        She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears.
        He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness.

        She walks away clutching the doll.

                            DELLA
                  Put the twins to bed by eight. Give
                  them a chocolate cookie with their
                  milk.

                                                Scene 3 Page 4
       


                            KENNETH
                  Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm
                  sorry.

        But she's already left the room. He watches her pick up a set
        of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. Her
        knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them.

        Kenneth turns back to his computer.

4                                                                     4
        INT. STAIRS - EVENING

        Della climbs the stairs. Framed photographs on the wall tell
        the public story of her life. The engagement to Kenneth,
        their wedding, the birth of the twins, Kenneth's graduation,
        Kenneth as a sixth grade football star, Della on the farm in
        Ohio with her horse, a really young Della playing baseball
        with her father. We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty
        something Della in a little black dress.

5                                                                     5
        INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING

        TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate
        blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother.

        Della stands in the doorway and watches them.

        Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons.
        Terri's toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammi's heirloom dolls
        house, starting with the furniture.

        She steps into the room.

                            TAMMI
                  Mommy can I get an American Girl
                  for Christmas?

                            TERRI
                  I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy.

                            DELLA
                  You better leave Santa a note. It's
                  only three days until Christmas.

        She gives them each a kiss, breathing in their scent she
        loves so much.

                            TAMMI
                  Where are you going, Mommy?

                                        Scene 5 Page 5
       


                             DELLA
                   The Mall. One chocolate cookie each
                   and then Daddy will read you a
                   bedtime story.

                             TAMMI
                   Daddy's stories are lame. I want
                   you to read us a story.

                             TERRI
                   Yeah Mommy, the one about the
                   pirates.

                             TAMMI
                   No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and
                   Slingshot Kitty.

                             DELLA
                   Tomorrow night I'll read you the
                   best bedtime story in the whole
                   world. I promise.

        Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave.

                              DELLA (CONT'D)
                   I'll check in on you both when I
                   get back.
                       (beat)
                   To make sure you're sleeping.

        She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs.
        Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been
        working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding
        hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a
        cloudy night sky like big stars.

                             DELLA (CONT'D)
                   Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.

        Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds
        the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi
        again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as
        she walks away.

        INT.   STAIRWAY - EVENING

        Della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs.

7                                                                     7
        INT.   HALLWAY - EVENING

        She sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots. The
        boots are well worn but polished to a gleam.

                                                  Scene 7 Page 6
       

        Behind her, an antique grandfather clock strikes seven p.m.
        The sound of gun shots fades in from the TV in Kenneth's
        office.

8                                                                     8
        INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

        Della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet. She looks
        at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks
        away.

9                                                                     9
        INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING

        Della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and
        opens the front door. The TV blares out some action flick
        from Kenneth's ajar door.


        TITLE     ---   "WHILE SHE WAS OUT"

        EXT.    DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING

        Della is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie
        silence of the suburbs. She closes the door softly behind her
        and rushes along the path to the driveway where the family's
        black Ford Explorer is parked.

        She CHIRPS the remote and quickly climbs in.

11                                                                   11
        INT.    FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

        Della inserts the key and turns it in the lock.    The car
        sputters in defiance against the cold night.

                               DELLA
                    Frick!

        The car sputters again.

                               DELLA (CONT'D)
                    C'MON...

        With a massive exertion, the car engine turns over and the
        vehicle starts. She sighs with relief.

        She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent,
        pauses to look at her home through the car window. For a
        second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of
        Tammi.

        She smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the
        Christmas tree. She notices the fallen star, is about to get
        out of the car to retrieve it, but decides it's too cold.

                                                Scene 11Page 7
        


      A shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into
      reverse and backs up.

      EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING

      We follow her as she backs up, pushes into drive and heads
      slowly down the boulevard.

      The road is empty. All the cars are neatly tucked away in
      their driveways and it looks like no one's out tonight. She
      makes a right turn onto.

13                                                                 13
      EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY CRESCENT - EVENING

      She follows the road as it curves around a long row of
      endlessly monotonous houses. In the distance, we can see the
      gates of Pleasant valley gated community.

14                                                                 14
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      She slows down, rolls down her window and swipes a chub card
      against the security panel. The gates slowly open. She drives
      through. The gates close behind her. She rolls the window up
      and makes a left turn onto.

15                                                                 15
      EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING

      The road is wider and framed on either side by the high walls
      of gated communities. A Ford Explorer just like hers passes
      in the opposite direction.

16                                                                 16
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      Della smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment
      with her free hand. She pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a
      flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her
      secret hiding place for:

      A nice pack of Marlboros. She smiles again - the smile of the
      secret smoker. She presses the cigarette lighter into the
      dashboard.

      The lighter pops out. She tips out a cigarette, sees a
      sticky note attached to the interior foil. Scrawled in messy
      handwriting are the words - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUITTING
      DELLA HONEY. XOXO KENNETH.

                          DELLA
                I'll get right on that Kenneth
                honey. AFTER you stop drinking.

      She rips the note off, stuffs it in her purse, lights the
      cigarette.

      She inhales deeply.     We see the pleasure written across her
      face.

17                                                                 17
      EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING

      A few cars pass Della in the night. Their lights are like
      torches in the suburban wilderness.

18                                                                 18
      INT. FORD EXPLORER/ EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING

      There is the familiar ring of a cellular phone. Della has
      programmed one of those "oh so cute" recognizable tunes into
      it, like the "William Tell overture".

      Della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her
      purse with the other. She eventually locates the phone.

                              DELLA
                  Hello?

                            MARY (V.O.)
                  Della, it's Mary Messina.

      Della rolls her eyes.     This is not a welcome call.

                              DELLA
                  Oh, hey.

                            MARY (V.O.)
                  You okay sweetie?

                            DELLA
                  Sure. How are you?

                              MARY (V.O.)
                  I'm well.

                            DELLA
                  How'd you get my cell number?

      Della balances the phone while she drags on her cigarette.

                            MARY (V.O.)
                  I called Kenneth at the house.

      Oh great.   She exhales sharply.

                                         Scene 18Page 9
       


                         DELLA
               And how'd that go? Did he give you
               an earful for disturbing his ninety
               ninth viewing of Lethal Weapon
               Four?

     Mary giggles.

                         MARY (V.O.)
               Oh Della. Kenneth is always
               charming. At least to me.

     The car flashes past the decorated sign for a local school.
     Before Della can stop herself, the words are out.

                         DELLA
               Well, with the way you flaunt your
               double D boob job at the free fun
               PTA events that's hardly a
               surprise.

     Fortunately for her the phone happens to make a deep metallic
     distortion at that moment.

                         MARY (V.O.)
               What was that?

                         DELLA
               Oh nothing, Mary.

                         MARY (V.O.)
               You got lucky with that one.
               Patricia Ellis says he's the best
               looking guy in Pleasant Valley.

                         DELLA
               Well that wouldn't be hard.
               Mary, do you need something? Cause
               I gotta go.

                         MARY (V.O.)
               Yes, are you going to Tool School
               tomorrow?

     Mary giggles at her own joke.

     Della sighs.    THIS is why she is having her serenity
     interrupted?

                                      Scene 18Page 10
       


                          DELLA

                Yourself Mechanics is without a
                doubt the most interesting thing in
                my life right now.

                I carry my beloved toolbox in the
                trunk at all times.

      The desolate road disappears behind Della.    She passes a
      roadside memorial.

                          MARY (V.O.)
                I'm just joking, Della. You know
                me. I pre-paid ten classes and only
                made it to two. If you are going I
                could use a ride. I'd hate to miss
                another class.

      If Della was going before, she's not now.

                          DELLA
                Sorry, Mary, I'm skipping this
                week. Kenneth's parents are coming
                to stay for Christmas. You know how
                it is.

      A red light looms ahead. Della slows.

                          MARY (V.O.)
                Oh that's too bad. Maybe Patricia
                Ellis will be going.

                          DELLA
                You check with her, Mary.

                          MARY (V.O.)
                Merry Christmas. God bless you and
                your family.

      Christmas lights outline a few distant houses.

                          DELLA
                You too.
                    (Under her breath)
                Bah Humbug.

                             MARY (V.O.)
                Pardon?

                             DELLA
                Bye, Mary.

      Della stops at the red light. She clicks off the phone and
      lets it lay on her lap.

      She rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat,
      casts aside, an anorak, mittens, a sock.

      She finds what she's looking for, a bottle of water, caught
      on the bar under the passenger seat. It's only a third full
      but she takes a sip, recoils from its coldness.

      The light changes.   She throws the bottle into the back seat.

      INT.   FORD EXPLORER - EVENING/ EXT CROSSROADS

      Della picks up the phone and pushes a few keys. She has not
      dialed enough to make a full phone call when we hear the
      phone RING on the other side.

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)

                 Please hold for that number.

      Della slows down for another red light.

      She's at a wide crossroads where the housing development
      abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins.

      A billboard for another new housing development announces:
      "GREEN STREET DREAM HOMES - Investment Opportunities".

      Waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from
      Della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof.

      Della tries not to look at it.

      A recording breaks into the moment just as the light ahead
      changes to green.

                Yes I knew.

                          MEGHAN (V.O.)
                Can you hold, I have another call?

                             DELLA
                Okay.

      Frustrated, Della turns on the radio.    It is some innocuous
      local ad.

      Della switches stations trying to find something she likes.
      She gives up and waits for Meghan to return. The car flashes
      past construction road signs.

                          MEGHAN (V.O.)

                become an outlaw or something.

      Meghan giggles. We hear the familiar beep of another call
      coming in.

      Cassie's voice is almost lost in the din of her surroundings.

      INT. FORD EXPLORER/EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - EVENING

      The car SCREECHES to a halt. Della almost didn't see it. She
      is at a railroad crossing, the third car in line, and she
      almost rear-ended the car in front of her.

                Just a minute, Della.

                          DELLA
                I almost rear-ended a car. Cassie?

      The phone cuts out. The train starts to go laboriously past.
      Carriage after carriage of brand name building materials for
      new housing developments.

      Della lights another cigarette.

      She turns on the radio again, finds a station playing "The
      Sound of Silence".

      The crossing gates go up.   The cars ahead of her start.
      Della shifts into drive.

      The phone rings its special tune again.   Della turns the
      volume of the radio down.

                          DELLA (CONT'D)
                What's up, Cassie?

                          CASSIE (V.O.)
                I'm over at Southeast Plaza. What
                was it we need to get for Pilates?

                Huh? One of those rubber balls, I
                think. I'm headed over there now.
                Ran out of Christmas wrapping
                paper. Would you believe it?

                It's hell here tonight. Everyone
                and their uncle is at the mall.

      Della's phone makes a loud, distorted noise.

                          DELLA
                Aw shoot. My cell battery's dying.

      She rifles about in the passenger seat, leans over to the
      back, and rifles about there among the kids toys, gives up.

                          DELLA (CONT'D)
                Damn, I must have left the charger
                in the other car.

                You want me to pick up something
                for you while I'm here?

      Cassie's kind offer almost reduces Della to tears.

                No....I'm just. I mean I'm. Oh
                nothing.

      The phone beeps again.

                           CASSIE (V.O.)
                Your phone's breaking up Della. I'm
                not joking when I say it's packed
                over here.

                          DELLA
                It can't be that bad?

      The light up ahead turns amber then red.    Della stops.

                          DELLA (CONT'D)
                Why don't we meet somewhere for a
                drink?

                          CASSIE (V.O.)
                Sure, but a latte's about the best
                they can do in this mall.

                          DELLA
                A latte's fine. Let's meet at the
                fountain opposite Victoria's
                Secret.

      The light changes and Della drives up and over a hill.

                          CASSIE (V.O.)
                Sounds good.

      The phone beeps again.

                          DELLA
                My battery's going. I'm a block
                away. See you in five minutes.

                          CASSIE (V.O.)
                Okay but I won't be able to wait
                very ....

      The phone beeps again.   It's over.

      Della lets it drop onto her lap. She opens the window and
      flicks out the remains of her cigarette. She waves her hands
      to fan away the smoke. She closes the window again.

      She's about to hide her cigarettes again when she changes her
      mind and stuffs them directly into her purse.

      As the car approaches the cusp of the hill she slows down to
      stare ahead.

      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT ENTRANCE - EVENING

      Southeast Plaza.   The day before Christmas Eve. Hell on
      Earth.

      A large, sprawling parking lot full of cars.   Nothing but
      cars. A sea of cars.

23                                                                 23
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      For a second, Della contemplates turning around and leaving.

      The guy in the SUV behind her beeps. She steps on the gas.

                          DELLA
                Okay, okay!

      Her car careens slowly down hill to the lot.

24                                                                 24
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT/INT. FORD - EVENING

      The road spits her out in front of the Mall entrance where
      revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting.

      Della follows several cars down the first long row of parked
      cars.

      The asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall. Puddles gather
      in its dents and hollows.

      She passes car after densely parked car. There isn't a space
      in sight. She reaches the end of the row and indicates left,
      turns down the next row, ploughs through a rain puddle which
      splashes up onto a MOTHER who's walking her little GIRL and
      BOY back to their car. The woman shouts at Della.

                          MOTHER
                Watch where you're going!

      Della rolls down her window.

                                      Scene 24Page 17
       


                          DELLA
                Sorry!

      The Mother's weighed down with shopping bags. She glares at
      Della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her.

      Della sighs, drives down the second aisle.

      An Escape midway down the row blocks traffic. It's waiting
      for a Subaru to pull out so it can take the spot.

25                                                                 25

                          DELLA
                Lucky son of a .....

      The Subaru exits the spot slowly. Della taps her impatient
      fingers against the steering wheel.

26                                                                 26
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      The Subaru pulls away and the Escape snaps into the empty
      space.

      Della continues her journey down to the end of the row. There
      are no spaces.

27                                                                 27
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      It dawns on her that parking up close to the entrance just
      isn't going to happen. She takes the last puff from the
      cigarette burning out in the ashtray.

28                                                                 28
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      Using the side aisle she scoots past row three and four as
      they all flow one way.

      At the end of this row a confrontation is brewing. Several
      cars block each other. Horns blast. An angry DRIVER screams
      at another.

                          ANGRY DRIVER
                If you think you're gonna steal my
                spot, think again, asshole!

29                                                                 29
      INT. FORD EXPLORER/EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      Della looks on for a moment at the confrontation. She grinds
      out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray, slams it
      closed.

                                                Scene 29Page 18
       


      Della shakes her head and turns left into row five. Jesus!
      Are there really this many cars in Pleasant Valley? It's a
      brand new Mall and the only one around for miles but this is
      ridiculous.

      Della reaches the end of row five quickly. She guessed there
      wouldn't be a spot so she's driving faster.

      She notices a portly middle aged RENT-A-COP directing traffic
      ahead. She lowers her window.

                          DELLA
                Hello?

      The Rent-a-Cop stops directing and approaches the car.

                          RENT-A-COP
                Can I help you?

                          DELLA
                Do you know where I can definitely
                find parking?

                          RENT-A-COP
                There's nothing close by. Even the
                valet's backed up. You might want
                to try further out.

      He points off into the distance through the sea of cars.

                          RENT-A-COP (CONT'D)
                But be willing to walk.

      A car waiting behind Della honks its horn loudly and the Rent-
      A-Cop saunters away. Della guns the Ford down row eight.

30                                                               30
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      At the end of this row, Della decides to take the Rent-A-
      Cop's advice. She makes another left at the aisle and skips
      several more rows. She heads down to the third from last row.

31                                                               31
      INT. FORD EXPLORER/EXT MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      Cars... cars... If she never sees another car it will be too
      soon.

      Della spies a spot, halfway down the row.

                          DELLA
                Yes!

                                               Scene 31Page 19
       


      She guns the engine, gets ready to pull in and is DENIED.

      Somebody has parked an enormous old gold Plymouth so badly
      it's taking up TWO spaces.

                          DELLA (CONT'D)
                Unbelievable!

      She brakes in the nick of time and sighs deeply. She's
      starting to lose her patience now.

32                                                                 32
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      With no options left, Della heads down to the very last row.
      More cars fill the spaces. And then - two spots. The last
      two spots in the car park. They overlook undeveloped land
      just beyond the mall. Small concrete bumps signify the end of
      each space.

33                                                                 33
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      Della whips the car into the first one. She sighs with
      relief as she straightens the car up into the spot. She sits
      for a second trying to calm herself down but it isn't
      working. She reaches for another cigarette, then, talks
      herself out of it.

      She fastens her coat, grabs her purse and opens the door.

34                                                                 34
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      Steps down from the Ford right into a puddle. The dirty water
      splashes up onto her pants.

                          DELLA
                GREAT!

      She shakes the boot off and looks over at the mall. It's at
      least a half mile away, glimmering in the distance.

      She sets off marching across the lot, taking what seems to be
      the most direct route. Maybe she can shake off this mood by
      the time she gets inside.

      She passes the Plymouth, turns, stares back at it. The car is
      dirty gold and riddled with rust holes with a vinyl roof
      that's almost peeled away. She walks up close, tries to
      decipher the plate, but it's caked with mud.

      Annoyance rises like bile in her throat.

                                               Scene 34Page 20
       


      She finds herself reaching into her purse, rummaging for a
      small notebook, then a sharpie. She leans on the car as she
      writes.


      DEAR JERK, IT'S GREAT YOU COULD USE UP TWO PARKING SPACES ON
      A NIGHT LIKE THIS. EVER HEAR OF THE JOY OF SHARING? SIGNED,
      A CONCERNED FRIEND.

      She scans her words.    Pretty good!

      Della rips the piece of paper from the notebook, folds the
      note several times and slides it under the Plymouth's
      windshield wipers. The driver can't miss it.

      She smiles. That felt good!

      Head held high she marches on towards the Mall.

      The CAMERA pulls up so we can see the mall, see Della
      marching across the lot, see the crowds of shoppers entering
      and exiting the mall, and get the feeling that maybe somebody
      just saw her.

35                                                                 35
      EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - EVENING

      Shoppers are buying freshly felled Christmas trees from a
      vendor. Della squeezes past and pushes through the mall
      doors.

36                                                                 36
      INT.   MALL - EVENING

      A wave of heat and Christmas lights hits Della. A wave of
      nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last
      minute shoppers. Distorted muzak versions of Christmas songs
      seep from invisible speakers.

      Della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see
      Santa in his grotto. She squeezes through and makes her way
      towards the fountain outside of Victoria's Secret.

      En route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays
      her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest.

                           PERFUME SALES LADY
                 It's a classic revival of Chanel
                 No.5. We have a wonderful Christmas
                 Special on offer at Macy's.

      She hands Della a sample and flyer.

                                               Scene 36Page 21
       


                            DELLA
                 Thanks.

      Della arrives at the fountain. A piddling jet of dirty water
      gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down
      into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. She scans
      the crowd but there's no sign of Cassie.

      Della sits at the edge of the fountain. She checks her watch
      then checks out the people milling around in front of
      Victoria's Secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive
      underwear are propped seductively in the window displays.

      Still no sign of Cassie. She's about to make a wish and throw
      a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes
      her "Save the Children" tin at her. Della sticks the quarter
      into the tin instead.

37                                                                 37
      INT.   VICTORIA'S SECRET - EVENING

      Della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching
      men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women
      examine slim fit underpants and padded bras.

      She notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills.
      She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in
      front of the mirror, tries to imagine herself in it.

      A young SALES ASSISTANT approaches.


                           VS SALES ASSISTANT
                 It's pure silk, the last one in our
                 classic black label collection.
                 Would you like me to fix you a
                 changing room?

      Della checks the size tag. It reads 36C, two sizes too big.
      And the price tag next to it. Ouch! It's expensive for
      Victoria's Secret.

                           DELLA
                 No thanks. Not my size.

      She gestures to her small boobs, smiles and hands the teddy
      to the sales assistant. She quickly leaves the shop.

38                                                                 38
      INT. MALL - EVENING

      Della checks one last time at the fountain for Cassie. She
      tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a
      generic coffee shop. Maybe Cassie will be there.

      INT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

      Harried women and a few men, clutching bags full of gifts and
      impatient children, stand on line for their favorite drug.

      Della squeezes past them to look for Cassie. Every seat at
      every booth is full but there's no sign of her friend.

      Della joins the line. She finds herself biting at her nails,
      a bad habit since childhood.

      A woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the
      pick up area. Della moves up to the counter to where an
      OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT waits on her.

                          DELLA
                A latte please?

      She notices some chocolate covered biscotti on the counter.

                          DELLA (CONT'D)
                And a chocolate biscotti.

      She catches sight of herself in the mirror behind the
      counter. Kenneth's right about one thing, she looks awful.

                          OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT
                Bitter or Milk chocolate?

      Seeing herself in the mirror changes her mind about the
      biscotti.

                          DELLA
                Forget it, just the coffee.

                          OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT

                Four dollars and seventy nine
                cents.

      Della pushes the money towards her and waits for her coffee.
      When it finally shows up her name is spelled DELA. She sighs
      and checks the line for Cassie as she leaves the shop.

      She passes a hair salon and presses her face to the steamy
      windows. Inside, women are getting their hair styled and
      their nails manicured at the same time.

      Della looks down at her bitten nails but just can't bring
      herself to go inside.

                          LYNN (O.S.)
                Della, is that you?

      She turns around to see LYNN MONROE, a pretty, well groomed
      redhead about her age.

                          DELLA
                Lynn Monroe!

                          LYNN
                I knew it was you, Della. I haven't
                seen you since college. You left to
                marry some handsome jock and we
                never heard from you again.

                          DELLA
                Something like that. Do you live
                around here now?

                house in Pleasant Valley. Do you
                know it? Great for the kids.

      Della nods but Lynn keeps speaking. Della sips on her latte.

                          LYNN (CONT'D)
                It's the first time I've left the
                doors unlocked since I was a child
                growing up in the Midwest. David's
                been promoted to VP of United
                Motors so it's all happening for
                us. But enough of me. How are you?

                           DELLA
                Oh, we have two kids. Twins, Tammi
                and Terri.

      Lynn becomes distracted, focusing on her perfect reflection
      in the steamy glass.

                                               Scene 40Page 24
       


                           LYNN
                 Why that's fantastic. Listen Della,
                 it's been great talking to you but
                 I have to go get my hair done!
                 David and I are going out tomorrow
                 night for a romantic dinner. I just
                 bought this gorgeous teddy from
                 Victoria's Secret.

      She opens the bag and Della sees it's the black teddy she
      eyed earlier. Della smiles.

                           LYNN (CONT'D)
                 Hope we bump into each other again
                 soon, sweetie. Merry Christmas

      She gives Della a fake kiss and rushes into the salon.

      Della chucks her half finished coffee into a nearby trash can
      and walks on through the Mall.

41                                                                41
      INT.   PHARMACY - EVENING

      Della enters a pharmacy. She locates the wrapping paper
      aisle. She sweeps up a bunch of rolls at three for ninety
      nine cents. She feels the texture of the paper, it's thin and
      looks gaudy so she puts them all back. Instead she selects
      some expensive gold paper with silver embossed stars and
      matching silver ribbon. She then finds some jolly children's
      wrapping with Christmas tree designs and a great big red bow.

      She browses through the aisles of cards. She sees some cute
      cards for the twins and then arrives at the "To my Darling
      Husband at Christmas" section. She opens some of the cards
      and recoils from the sentiments contained inside.

      She catches a groomed BLONDE HOUSEWIFE staring at her and
      corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a
      complicit Stepford smile.

                           DELLA
                 It's a pity they don't have any "To
                 a bastard at Christmas" cards.

      The woman looks at Della like she's a lunatic. Della chuckles
      to herself.

      She finds the feminine hygiene aisle and picks up a pack of
      regular tampax.

      She gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a
      TIRED MAN and his TWO KIDS wait before her on the line.

                                                  Scene 41Page 25
       

      The man tries to remove a snow globe, with a tiny house and
      Christmas tree inside, from the clutches of his young son.
      The child starts bawling. The man ends up buying the snow
      globe to placate the child.

      It's Della's turn.

      The PHARMACY SALES ASSISTANT smiles.

                             PH SALES ASSISTANT
                   Perfect timing!

                             DELLA
                   God planned it for Christmas Day
                   just to tick me off.

                             PH SALES ASSISTANT
                   Thirty dollars and sixty nine cents

      She packs Della's stuff into paper bags. Della hands her visa
      card over.

                             DELLA
                   Thanks.

                             PH SALES ASSISTANT
                   Merry Christmas.

      INT. MALL - EVENING

      It's a lot less crowded now. The melancholy "Home for
      Christmas" plays. She follows the ladies sign to the entrance
      to the bathroom, only to find an "Out of Order" sign on the
      door. She sees a cleaning lady in the corridor.

                             DELLA
                   How come the ladies' bathroom is
                   out of order on a night like this?

                             CLEANING LADY
                   The one at the other side of the
                   mall is open, Ma'am.

      The    cleaning lady disappears through the bathroom door with
      her    cart of cleaning utensils. Della looks down the length of
      the    huge mall and decides she's not even going to try to find
      the    other bathroom. She can wait until she gets home.

      She makes her way towards the exit, pulls her coat in tight
      and braces herself for the cold front outside.

      EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - EVENING

      A group of CAROL SINGERS sing "Silent Night".

                          CAROL SINGERS
                Silent Night. Holy Night. All is
                calm. All is bright.

      Della listens for a moment. Their voices are clear and
      bright.

      Behind them she can see the Christmas tree vendor bag up the
      left over trees.

      Della's hands start to pinch with the cold.

      She gathers her bags of wrapping paper and sets off across
      the emptying lot. The last of the shoppers rush across the
      car park to find their cars. It's pretty dark between the dim
      pole lamps and the car lights.

      She slows down at the second aisle for a car to pass, then
      another. Marches on.

      A man and his little girl walk past. He nods. Della's eyes
      linger on the little girl. She really wants to get home to
      the kids.

      The singers' voices echo faintly through the night.

                          CAROL SINGERS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Holy infant so tender and mild.

      She walks faster, almost at a dash.

      Where is her car? Even further out than she remembered,
      that's for sure.

      A car alarm goes off in the distance.

      The alarm stops at last as Della approaches the outer section
      of the parking lot.

                          CAROL SINGERS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Shepherds quake at the sight.
                Glories beam from heaven afar.

      She cuts between some of the cars in row eight. Zigzags
      across aisle nine. Notices the Plymouth still parked ahead.

      She stops for a split second. Then approaches. Glances at the
      windshield. The note is gone.

                                                 Scene 43Page 27
       


      Maybe it fell off. She checks the ground around the car. No
      sign of it. She shrugs, who cares anyway?

      She cuts across the next aisle. It's almost empty. And the
      one after that. Her Explorer is sandwiched between two cars
      in this otherwise empty row.

                           CAROL SINGERS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                 Silent Night. Holy Night

      She chirps the remote twice and pops the trunk, places the
      bags inside. She slams the trunk closed and hurries to the
      drivers' side, climbs in, pulling the door closed behind her.

44                                                                 44
      INT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING

      Della turns the key in the ignition and presses in the
      lighter. She lights a cigarette and inhales as she lets the
      car warm up for 30 seconds.

      She rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the
      hand brake and slips the gear into reverse. The interior of
      her car is suddenly flooded with light from another car's
      headlights. She glances in the rear view mirror. A car is
      blocking her.

                           DELLA
                 Good Lord! What now?

      She steps on the brake and waits for the car to move.

      But it doesn't. Its headlights flick to full beam blinding
      her view in her car mirrors. She honks her horn. The car
      still doesn't move.

      Della's really angry now. She slips the gearshift into park
      and steps out of her car.

45                                                                 45
      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      Della squints in the blinding headlights. The front of the
      car looks familiar. It's the gold Plymouth!

      Two unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again.

      The lights abruptly go out. Della blinks, her eyes try to
      adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few
      car lengths away.

      She uneasily turns back to her car.

                                       Scene 45Page 28
       


                          CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                I got a gun.

      It's a young male voice. The statement stops Della dead in
      her tracks.

                          CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                How's about I aim it at your pussy
                first?

      The words are emphasized by another boy's shrill giggling.
      Della freezes. This can't be happening!

      Her eyes are adjusting. The glare phantoms drift out to the
      limit of her peripheral vision and vanish.

      She sees three boys in front of her, then a fourth, but she
      doesn't see any gun.

                          DELLA
                What the hell are you playing at?

                          HUEY
                Trust the nigga, we not playin'.

      HUEY is a sweet-faced African-American decked out in a hip
      hop style. He's small and skinny and can't be more than
      eighteen. He's playing to CHUCKIE who's twenty-one and looks
      like a marine gone AWOL. Bracketing them is VINH, a nineteen
      year old Asian punk and TOMAS, twenty, a Latino runaway in an
      American Idol T-shirt.

      Della's eyes drift across the group. She suppresses a
      hysterical giggle but can't resist smarting off.

                          DELLA
                What are you? The world's first
                homeless United Nations Boy Band?

                          HUEY
                Hell, yeah. We just wanna do shows
                and bone hoes.

      Huey messes with his zipper.

                          HUEY (CONT'D)
                We got a song fo' yo. It's called
                "shut up bitch and eat a dick".

      Huey and Tomas snigger. Vinh stares at the asphalt.

                                       Scene 45Page 29
       


                          TOMAS
                And when yo done eating we gonna
                staple that bitch mouth closed.

      Chuckie nudges Huey and Tomas, steps towards Della.

                          CHUCKIE
                Now, now, my little brothers.

      The boys fall silent.   Vinh lights a cigarette. Huey shivers.

                          HUEY
                It gitting cold, Chuckie. Game's
                not worth the dime.

                          DELLA
                    (incredulous)
                Chuckie? At least your parents have
                a sense of humor.

                          CHUCKIE
                Parents? I ain't got no parents. I
                named myself.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                    (to Huey)
                Grab my parka from the back seat.

      He pinches Huey's cheeks.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                And smile, playa. The dopes game
                and the game's dope.

      Chuckie leads Huey a few steps to the Plymouth. Huey ducks
      into the back seat. Chuckie keeps his eyes fixed on Della.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                You got a beef with us, Mrs.
                Podunk?

      Della looks defiantly back without answering. Chuckie runs
      his fingers along the hood of the rusty gold Plymouth.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                First you put yo hands on my ride!
                Now, I don't know how you was
                raised but, in my world, laying
                your hands on someone else's shit
                is crossing their line!
                Then, you go slipping an incendiary
                note up under my windscreen wipers.

                Well, that'd UCKIE(CONT'D)
                          CH be an invitation to
                war to me and my ghetto soldiers.

                          DELLA
                What? If you hadn't parked like an
                asshole, we wouldn't be arguing
                about it right now.

      Vinh inhales sharply from his cigarette.

                          VINH
                Whoah Lady!

                          TOMAS
                Keep right on talking that gang a
                shit, chinga. Yo crimes against the
                click are digging yo grave deep.

      Della's eyes quickly scan the group for sign of the gun. She
      can't see one so she gambles they're just mouthing off and
      makes her move.

                          DELLA.
                Go to hell!

      Della turns towards her car. Huey steps out of the shadows
      wearing Chuckie's parka hood up covering his face, startles
      Della.

                          HUEY
                We already in hell.

      Della sidesteps him, reaches the back of her car.

                          RENT-A-COP (O.S.)
                Any trouble here, ma'am?

      Everyone turns to see a Rent-a-Cop, puffed up like a pigeon
      in his fur trimmed jacket and Russian style cap. It's the
      same guy Della approached earlier when she was looking for
      spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across
      the unsnapped holster flap at his hip.

                          DELLA
                Not if these delinquents move their
                barge so I can back up.

                          RENT-A-COP
                How about it, boys?

      Chuckie smiles and nudges Tomas who starts dancing in a real
      mocking manner imitating the Rent-a-Cop.

                                               Scene 45Page 31
       

      Chuckie pulls a gun from deep in his army jacket pocket and
      points it straight at the Rent-a-Cop's face.

                          CHUCKIE
                Nah. We not in the mood.

      Chuckie looks at his friends for approval. Huey laughs again,
      shrill. Tomas grins. Vinh hunches and looks around.

      The Rent-a-Cop backs away.

                          RENT-A-COP
                For Jesus' sake.

      Tomas takes off a small crucifix from around his neck and
      dangles it in front of the Rent-a-Cop.

                          TOMAS
                Say yo prayers old man.

      Chuckie grins at Della while keeping the gun pointed straight
      at the Rent-a-Cop.

                          CHUCKIE
                These Rent-a-Pig companies are too
                lame to give their foot soldiers
                any ammo. Liability laws and all
                that. Tough shit!

      The Rent-a-Cop goes for his pistol anyway.

      Chuckie shoots him in the face.

      THIS MOMENT CHANGES EVERYTHING.

      We thought Della was in trouble but now we know she is.

      The bullet hits the Rent-A-Cop in the forehead. Blood spurts
      from the exit wound. He slumps to the asphalt like a
      marionette whose strings have just been cut. Bullet smoke
      hangs in the air where he once stood. Smoke too blackens the
      bullets entry wound. Blood puddles out from the back of his
      head.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                Fuck!

      It's clear that Chuckie's been acting harder than he is. The
      hand that holds the gun is trembling. The color drains from
      his face.

      All stand riveted in shock.

                                               Scene 45Page 32
       


      A deathly silence follows. The carol singers can be heard in
      the distance faintly finishing up Silent Night.

                          CAROL SINGERS (O.S.)
                Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in
                heavenly peace.

      Chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is
      forthcoming.

      The Rent-A-Cop's body twitches.

      Chuckie hesitates then raises the gun. He aims and fires. The
      shot shatters the top of the Rent-A-Cop's head. Chuckie
      flinches, closes his own eyes in reflex.

      Della swallows. If she started screaming now, she may never
      stop. She spins instead and makes for her car door. She's
      dead if she doesn't get out of here and she knows it.

                          VINH
                She's busting a move!

      Chuckie opens his eyes. Vinh points to Della.

      Chuckie looks over and sees Della disappear through the door
      of her Explorer. Agitation overwhelms him.

                          CHUCKIE
                She ain't going nowhere. We got her
                Ford blocked in, right?

      He looks at Vinh who nods then at Huey.

                          HUEY
                I don't know nothing.

      Chuckie looks back at Vinh then over at Tomas.

                          TOMAS
                (muttering)
                Dar candela por el culo!

                          CHUCKIE
                I can just put one through her
                windshield, right?

      No one answers. Chuckie turns once more to the Rent-a-Cop
      whose body still twitches in some final death throe.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                Will you just DIE ?!

      He raises the gun.

      Another shot explodes into the night.

      INT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING

      Della flinches but no   bullet tears through the back of her
      skull. She slams into   the driver's seat and punches the door
      lock switch. She hits   the four wheel drive button and presses
      the accelerator pedal   to the metal.

      The Explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and
      bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier. The barrier
      screeches along the underside of the frame. There is a loud
      SCRAAAAAPE noise as the car heaves over the barrier. Then,
      the rear wheels bounce and claw over. The car fishtails
      momentarily.

                           DELLA
                 Please God. Don't overcorrect.

      She releases the pressure on the accelerator. The Explorer
      straightens.

      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING

      Tomas screams at Chuckie.

                           TOMAS
                 Chinga tu madre. She making her
                 getaway.

      All except Chuckie turn to look as Della accelerates across
      the unfinished outskirts of the car park behind them.

      Vinh tugs at Chuckie's sleeve.

                             VINH
                 Chuckie!

      But Chuckie's staring at the bloody mess he made, with a
      faraway look in his eyes, like he's disassociating.

      Vinh throws down the stub of his cigarette, follows Tomas
      into the Plymouth. Tomas guns the engine.

                           HUEY
                 She on her cell right now calling
                 the pigs.

      Huey's almost hysterical.

                                               Scene 47Page 34

      Chuckie turns on him.

                           CHUCKIE
                 You gone buck wild, nigga? We ain't
                 going down for shit.

                           HUEY

                 me a nigga. And that goes for all
                 you haters.

      Behind him Della's car turns onto the mall's outer perimeter
      service road in the distance.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Easy my G. Easy.

      Chuckie cajoles Huey.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 The world is our bitch, right?

      Huey calms down.

      Chuckie gently pushes him into the Plymouth back seat beside
      Vinh.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Get in my fallen soldier.

      Chuckie opens the driver door.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Shove over Tomas. You know I front
                 the ride.

      Tomas shuffles over to the passenger seat. Chuckie climbs
      into driver side. Doors slam. The Plymouth screeches across
      the parking lot and exits onto the service road.

      EXT.   SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

      Della speeds down the long dark empty service road which
      skims the deserted warehouses at the back of the Mall.
      Between the warehouses are dark patches of undeveloped land -
      No Mans land.

      Not a car nor a person in sight.

      It starts to rain.

      She shakes the cell phone trying to revive its dead battery.
      Types 911 in anyway. No connection. No response. She shakes
      it some more. Gives up.

      She relentlessly checks the rearview and side mirrors as she
      races into the rainy night.

      The driving conditions are not good, poor visibility ahead.
      Too bad. She speeds anyway.

      The road has to connect to a main road soon!

      Another glance in the rearview. Nothing. Side mirror. Still
      clear. Once more in the rearview. Headlights!

                           DELLA
                No!

      Side mirror. It's the Plymouth.

      She presses the accelerator down harder. The engine revs.

      In the rearview there's a sudden flash above her rear left
      headlight. And another.

                           DELLA (CONT'D)
                Jesus!

      They're shooting at her!

      Della steps the accelerator to the floor praying the Explorer
      won't skid out. The engine struggles, catches up.

      The sudden speed causes a small silver love heart, hanging on
      a silver chain necklace from the rearview mirror, to crash
      against the window. The catch bursts open to reveal two tiny
      photos of the twins inside. The necklace flies back and forth
      against the window as the Explorer races onwards.

50                                                                 50
      EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

      The Plymouth accelerates behind blasting rap. Its thick tires
      plow along the wet asphalt, gripping to the road below in
      steady pursuit. Its windows are all steamed up. The front
      passenger window is open, a hand and a gun muzzle stick
      through.

      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      Another flash and Della's left side mirror shatters.

      She swerves in panic. Her car almost hits the ditch.

      This can't be happening. Not to her.

      She reclaims the steering wheel.   Straightens up. Hits the
      accelerator again.

52                                                                  52
      EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

      The Plymouth swerves behind on the skid that Della created,
      corrects itself just before the ditch.

      Della gains speed. The Plymouth lags.

      A stop sign appears ahead. The road's ending.

53                                                                  53

      Right or left, Della? Make a choice.

      EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING

      There is no choice. A barrier blocks the left hand turn. A
      big sign reads "LOT FULL".

55                                                                  55

      Della swings right instead.

      The streetlights recede behind her.

      EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

      Nothing but the darkness of a housing complex under
      construction ahead.

      But she seems to have shaken off her pursuers.

      She speeds down the road, looking intently for any sign of
      life. But there's nothing but half-built houses, empty
      houses, houses just like hers.

57                                                                  57
      EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN MINI MALL - EVENING

      A Seven Eleven sign appears. She slows down. But it may as
      well be a mirage, it's an unfinished building with only the
      sign, in an unfinished mini-mall.

      Close to screaming now she speeds up.

      Then, what looks like a filling station, one light on in the

      Hope. She pulls in and dims her lights, drives right up to
      the kiosk door.

      Hope dashed.

      EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING

      It's in its final stages of installation but definitely not
      functioning. And there's no one there.

      EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

      Back onto the road and she sees far behind her, car
      headlights that can only belong to the Plymouth, following
      her through the darkness.

      She dims her lights to just the side lights. Hurtles along
      the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher. Potholes
      filled with mud and rain water splash against the car.

64                                                                 64

      EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

      The potholes yawn deeper. The asphalt ends. Gravel
      deteriorates to dirt.

      EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

      A wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly
      ahead.

68                                                                68
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into
      the barrier.

      There's a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays
      around her.

69                                                                69

      The Explorer SLAMS through and VEERS towards a clump of
      trees.

      Della tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast.

71                                                                71
      EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

      The car swings, then CRASHES right into a Pine tree.

72                                                                72
      INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

      The Car stalls out. SILENCE. A prolonged moment.

      Then Della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine
      needles and glass from her hair. She reaches up and hits the
      light switch.

      Pine branches protrude through the broken windshield.

      Using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the
      driver's seat and sits down.

      She slides the gear into park, turns the key. The engine
      groans like a dying animal, then gives up.

      She takes a deep breath.

      She tries again. The engine groans again, another death
      rattle. It just won't catch.

      She switches off the interior light and pushes the driver
      door open. She steps out of the car.

                                               Scene 73Page 39

      EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

      She closes the door behind her so's not to trigger the light
      switch. Finds her legs are giddy. Holds onto the door frame
      for a moment to steady herself.

      It looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing
      development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old
      forest.

      The dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier, into the
      midst of the forest. Behind her, shrouded in darkness, houses
      in different stages of development dot the deforested
      landscape. Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened
      land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest.

      Patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light
      from the moon which hides in an overcast sky.

      Jesus! She's driven all the way from the Mall only to find
      herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths
      on her tail.

      This must be some sick joke.

      Speaking of which, where are these little bastards? Her eyes
      scan the darkness for a sign. Nothing. That doesn't mean
      they're not close by.

      She checks out the damage to the car by feel. The driver's
      side is scratched and dented. The front is wedged into the
      tree.

      The only way out is for her to back up the car.

      She climbs back in for another try.

74                                                                 74
      INT.   FORD EXPLORER   - EVENING

      Della turns the key. It barely even groans this time. Just a
      faint gurgle. Then gone.

      She rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare,
      sticks it in her pocket.

      She leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk.

75                                                                 75
      EXT.   EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

      Della runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in
      the trunk.

                                               Scene 75Page 40
       


      She throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as
      she searches. Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then
      a small tool box.

      She hears the screech of a car's wheels spinning in mud.

76                                                                76
      EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

      Della turns to see headlights in the distance on the road
      behind, pointing upwards.

                            DELLA
                Huh!

      The Plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud.

77                                                                77
      EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

      She closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the
      car, clutching the toolbox and the wrench. She reaches back
      into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash.
      Pop. She softly closes the door again. Punches her way
      through the branches. Slides her fingers under the hood,
      pries up the lever. It pops up only a few inches.

                            DELLA
                Damn!

      She tries to manually lift it. But it's heavy with the weight
      of pine branches.

      Voices drift towards her.

      The sound of car doors opening, feet squishing into the mud
      and cussing. The boys materialize in the light from the
      headlights.

                Podunk you and the Spanish dancer
                can hit the next mall. But first
                you fakers best haul this rider out
                of the filth.

                          VINH
                Stupid ass car got nowhere else to
                go. There's nothing but trees up
                ahead.

                          TOMAS
                Screw the car, Chuckie. Case you
                forgot we got a witness on the
                loose! I ain't want to end up in
                the clink as some chimp's prison
                pillow.

                           CHUCKIE
                Trust me dog, hoe's going down
                execution style before we see the
                other side o' them bars.

      Della drops the hood. It makes a faint squeak but doesn't
      slam down, seems it's stuck open these last few inches.

                          TOMAS
                Yo talk a real mob threat, Chuckie.
                But what if she gone already?

      Chuckie's eyes scan the housing estate.

                          CHUCKIE
                She ain't gone.

      Della frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the
      hood. But some larger branches are jammed, wedged by the
      broken tree.

      When she looks back over for the boys she sees the car
      headlights are off and there's no sign of them.

                                                Scene 77Page 42
       

      She stands stock still, listening, scanning the landscape for
      a sign of them.

      The sound of glass shattering breaks the silence.

      Della jumps out of her skin, spins around. Her eyes settle on
      a light in the distance.

78                                                              78
      EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

      The light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving
      truck. The cabin glows like a box in the darkness. There's a
      figure inside: it's Chuckie. He's inspecting a powerful
      construction flashlight. He switches settings from broad
      light to concentrated beam. He points the beam through the
      broken glass window onto Tomas, who's standing on a truck
      tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow.
      Chuckie leaps down through the broken window, pleased with
      his find.

      He switches it to broad beam, whistles.

                          CHUCKIE
                Won't be long before we find her
                now. This baby could spot a needle
                in a haystack!

      The light dances around illuminating each of their faces for
      seconds at a time. Eerie distorted glimpses. They're
      traipsing along the rough road, through the mud, towards
      Della. Their voices grow louder.

                          HUEY
                We caught up in this bitch's life
                like a soap opera. We could just
                bail, blast out of town like we was
                never here.

                          CHUCKIE
                This boy loves weed so much he
                tried to marry Juana.

                          HUEY
                Ain't no one cares about the Rent-a-
                Pig. He just collateral damage to
                the peeps at the mall.

      Chuckie pushes Huey half playfully, half annoyed.

                          CHUCKIE
                Listen up skippy: SHE THE ONLY
                WITNESS.

                                               Scene 78Page 43
       


                          HUEY
                But if we hit the road now we'll be
                five hundred miles away before they
                find him....we could be drinking
                cold beer and swimmin' in the
                Atlantic....just like you promised.

      Huey stares off into space like he's having a vision.

                          CHUCKIE
                We gotta take care of her. When she
                gone. The problem gone. Right?
                We'll head off then, Huey, just
                like I said.

      Huey shakes his head in disbelief.

                            HUEY
                We ain't   gonna make it, are we
                Chuckie?   I ain't never gonna see
                it. It's   over for that, isn't it
                Chuckie?   Just say it.

      Chuckie is taken aback by what Huey is saying. He walks away,
      turns his concentration back to the flashlight. Huey calls
      after him.

                          HUEY (CONT'D)
                She was just some stupid housewife
                mouthin' off.

                          CHUCKIE
                GET REAL Huey! And shut the fuck up
                about the stupid ocean.

      Chuckie gets right up in Huey's face.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                I ever break a promise to you? I
                ever let you down?

      Huey takes his time to answer.

                          HUEY
                No Chuckie, you ain't.

      Chuckie puts his hand on Hueys shoulder and gently pushes him
      along the road.

79                                                              79
      EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

      Della tries once more to lift the hood. It still won't budge.

                                               Scene 79Page 44
       


      When she looks up the flashlight is dancing towards her.

      Vinh sees the car.

                          VINH (O.S.)
                There's her Ford.

      Della grabs the lug wrench and toolbox and ducks behind the
      trees.

      Della sees them approach her car.

                          VINH (CONT'D)
                There's broken glass everywhere.

      Huey, now resigned to their mission, comments sadly.

                          HUEY
                Someone call her mama tell her to
                lay out her black dress.

      Della creeps softly along the edge of the trees. She holds
      her breath. If she makes a sound, she's dead.

                          TOMAS
                Is she dead already?

      The boys kick around the Explorer.

                          VINH
                Musta gone been thrown through the
                windshield.

      Della skims the trees, constantly checking behind her, to
      where her antagonists check out the Ford wreck.

      Chuckie points to some footprints.

                          CHUCKIE
                She ain't dead. Look! Her
                footprints are all around.

      When there's enough distance between them and her, she darts
      from the forest's edge into the development and hides behind
      a half finished house.

80                                                                 80
      EXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING

      She leans against a recently bricked wall, finally takes a
      breath. The smell of fresh cement and putty fills her
      nostrils.

                                               Scene 80Page 45
       


      Rain gathers and drips from a nearby ledge

      She peers around the side of the house.

81                                                                81
      EXT. EDGE OF WOODS/CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING

      Beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs, she
      sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her Ford,
      illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight.

      Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and
      structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall.

      When she looks back over for the boys, she sees that the
      flashlight and the boys are gone.

      She strains her eyes. Guesses that must mean they're off
      looking for her in another direction.

      She clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the
      houses.

      If she could just track along the edge of the development she
      could maybe make it back to the Shopping Mall, to the twins.

      An owl hoots from the trees behind. She freezes, eyes
      sweeping the immediate area for danger.

      She waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more
      between the edge of the development and the edge of the
      trees.

      She's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be
      invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and
      form.

      On one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with
      thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. On the other,
      plots and structures of homes to be.

      She keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees,
      following the lights in the distance.

      She hears a loud thudding noise. Stops. Stops breathing.

82                                                                82
      EXT. PLANKS IN TARP - EVENING

      Ahead, piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view.

      She braces herself, peers cautiously around, sees nothing.
      She clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards.

                                                Scene 82Page 46
       

      Rain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping
      down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp
      causing the sound.

      She breathes a sigh of relief.

83                                                                 83
      EXT. CEMENT PILES - EVENING

      Heaps of damp shingle and cement cause her to back up and
      around past them and a cement mixer. She loses sight of the
      neon mall lights. She panics.

84                                                                 84
      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING

      She runs between the foundations of two houses.

      She stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming
      across her path.

      She ducks down the side of a half finished house.

      Sees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck.

      She keeps going, between the houses, looking for a sign of
      the mall lights.

      She stops.

      Just ahead, a flurry of footprints.

      They're her footprints!

85                                                                 85
      EXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING

      She finds herself back where she started, at the same house.

      The mall lights flicker in the distance as far away as they
      always were. The Ford's still there ahead.

      And then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her.

                              DELLA
                       (under her breath)
                   NO! OH NO.

      She bites back a sob.

86                                                                 86
      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING

      Della shrinks backwards between the houses. She ducks into
      an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead.

                                                Scene 86Page 47
       


      She runs into the house and out through the far side. Skirts
      a row of plots of land. Then, she hears Chuckie's mocking
      voice, echoing through the building site.

                            CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                DELLA!

      Della recoils. Did she just hallucinate?

      How the hell do they know her name?

      Can they see her? Or is he just shouting her name randomly
      into the night?

      Her eyes dart right then left then back again.   Nothing.

      She runs down a row of house foundations.

                            CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                Della!

87                                                                 87
      INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 2 - EVENING

      Della dives into an unfinished house, hides behind a space
      where a window will eventually be, looks out across the
      building site. All is dark outside. And then she sees the
      light several rows down, weaving between the houses.

      She makes for another window at the opposite end of the
      house. She sees the mall lights and decides to head once more
      towards them.

88                                                                 88
      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -EVENING

      She creeps out of the house and crosses several rows of
      houses, then several more, heading towards the neon lights in
      the distance.

89                                                                 89
      EXT. FENCE -EVENING

      She stops dead in her tracks. Straight ahead, a truly
      chilling sight - her kids stuff from the car : Terri's little
      anorak, Tammi's socks, mittens, strung along a short stretch
      of wire fence.

      Her feet start to sink into wet mud. She covers her mouth to
      stop herself crying out.

90                                                                 90
      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -EVENING

      Suddenly the development is illuminated by a huge
      construction light.

                                               Scene 91Page 48

      EXT. MUD -EVENING

      Della ducks down, tries to run. The mud cloys at her feet.

92                                                                 92
      EXT. PLANK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES -EVENING

      She steps up onto a plank that stretches between the first
      floors of two houses. She starts to cross when she sees their
      silhouettes.

93                                                                 93
      EXT./INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 3 -EVENING

      They're searching the house next door.

                          TOMAS
                Where'd little red riding hood git
                to?

                          VINH
                She ain't leaving any bread crumbs
                that's for sure.

                          HUEY
                When a nigga hungry, Imma wolf.

      EXT. PLANK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES - EVENING

      She backs up, slips, slides off the plank, falls into the
      mud, catches herself on some barbed wire.

                          CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                What was that?

      The wire drives through her coat and into her right shoulder.

      She jerks away but the length of loose barbed wire follows.
      She bites her lip to prevent a pained response.

      She's caught in its spiral like a trapped animal. She spins
      around and physically pulls the wire from her back, tearing
      her coat.

      She casts the wire away from her. Winces.

95                                                                 95
      INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 (FOUNDATION) -EVENING

      She crawls into the foundations of a nearby house, underneath
      the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first
      floor. She huddles in a dark corner. It's very quiet and
      cramped. She tries not to move, not to breathe. The smell of
      the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous. A moment
      passes. It feels like an infinity.

                                               Scene 95Page 49
       


      She starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see
      if she can see anything above. Just as she approaches the gap
      she hears.

      The sound of footsteps above her.

      She freezes.

      The footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks.

      She silently undoes the catch of the toolbox. Her hands are
      shaking. She lifts the lid. She rakes around inside for
      tools, comes across several kids toys instead! In shock, she
      rakes around some more, trying to find something else,
      something more dangerous, anything. To her surprise the only
      tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small
      crescent wrench. The kids must have borrowed the other tools
      replacing them with the toys. She gives up, closes over the
      lid.

      Then suddenly:

      BOOM

96                                                               96
      INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 -EVENING

      The whole house is illuminated. She looks up to see four
      faces looking down at her. Chuckie points the gaze of a
      powerful flashlight directly into her eyes.

      The beam almost blinds her. She tries to look away but
      Chuckie focuses it right in her eyes.

                          CHUCKIE
                Peek a boo!

      She shrinks back towards the wall. Her mouth feels dry, so
      dry. Tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so
      they can see her. She's cornered.

      Chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it
      voyeuristically down across her body.

      The light lingers on her breasts. Huey whistles
      appreciatively, picks the game back up from the parking lot.

                          HUEY
                Yo left without yo goodbye kiss.

      The light sweeps past Huey's hips. The sound of a zipper. The
      light sweeps back up onto Della.

                                               Scene 96Page 50
       


                          CHUCKIE
                You a window shopper little
                brother. You ain't never even done
                the old in and out before.

      Waves of pain spasm through Della's shoulder.

      The boys snigger.

                          HUEY
                Imma just a young playa tryin' to
                put my bid in.

      Tomas leans down towards Della. Chuckie moves the flashlight
      to illuminate them both. Tomas drains the last dregs from a
      bottle of Bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the
      foundations. It rolls into the darkness.

      Della shudders. She clutches the lug wrench against her coat
      behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall.

                          TOMAS
                Don't worry, when we done wit you
                we send yo back in yo trunk to Mr.
                Podunk.

      Tomas reaches down and pulls Della up to standing by the coat
      collar. He then yanks the coat down over her shoulder. The
      white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making
      the form of her breasts very clear.

      Chuckie keeps the light focused right on her.

      Tomas slides his index finger down across Della's neck
      towards her breasts.

      Della claws at Tomas' face with the nails of her free hand.
      He staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing. Her
      chewed nails haven't left any dents, but she stunned him.

      The others laugh.

      She shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it
      tight across herself, once again clasping the toolbox close
      to her side.

                          TOMAS (CONT'D)
                Don't want to play nice? Puta!

      He moves towards her, face twisted with hate, arm raised.

                                               Scene 96Page 51
       


                          CHUCKIE
                Back off five minutes, my Ghetto
                brother.

      Tomas glares at Della, then lowers his arm. Spits on the
      ground instead. Turns back to the boys. Chuckie moves
      forwards and focuses on Della's box?

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                What's with the man size crast?

      Della doesn't answer.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                You running with the family jewels?

      Della still doesn't answer.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                You rob a bank this morning, Della?

      Della remains determinedly mute.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                Least yo learned something tonight
                Della honey?

                          VINH
                Yeah, like how to quit mouthing if
                you wanna avoid drama.

                          CHUCKIE
                You must be wondering how we come
                to know your name.

      Chuckie giggles. Della shivers.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                You screwed up Della Myers. Left
                your purse in the Ford.

      Chuckie holds up her driving licence and examines it.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                What a shitty photo!

      Chuckie nods to Vinh. Vinh passes his lighter to Chuckie.
      Chuckie lights the licence on fire. The plastic burns black
      and toxic. The flame annihilates Della's name, her date of
      birth, her face. Pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up
      through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house.

                                                Scene 96Page 52
       


                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                Guess you won't be needing it no
                more.

      Della stares defiantly, fighting back the internal nausea
      caused by this symbolically brutal act.

      Chuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back
      on his own menacing face. Then, back again on her face. She
      becomes disoriented.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                So what's in the box?

      Della remains mute, looks away from the beam.

                          HUEY
                Yo think she carrying the big
                notes, maybe some ice?

                          CHUCKIE
                Nah, it ain't about to rain
                diamonds, Huey. But maybe she
                cashed in her life savings. Planned
                to take off, start a new life.

      Della tries to swallow but her throat is too dry.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                That right Della?

                          TOMAS
                You got enough scratch in there to
                grease us up with?

      She knows there is nothing that would buy them off and the
      knowledge sinks like a stone deep into her gut.

      Chuckie follows her face with the beam. She tries to dodge
      its glare in her eyes. But he maneuvers it like a
      surveillance camera.

      His voice takes on a meanness that makes the back of her neck
      tingle.

                           CHUCKIE
                Open it.

      They crowd closer toward her.

      Dark forms with eyes glinting. Their voices echoing.

                                               Scene 96Page 53
       


                          VINH
                Open the box else we put you in
                trauma.

                             CHUCKIE
                OPEN IT!

      Della all but screams.

                          DELLA
                Okay!
                I'll open it.

      Della's brain races.

      Her hands move slowly.

      She rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of
      the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch.

      She holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand
      from the beam as she slips it inside the box.

      A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel
      the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench.

      She curls them around its handle and grips tight. A surge of
      nervous energy courses through her veins.

                          TOMAS
                She ain't got nuthin'. Let's just
                take that pussy and git going.

      He moves towards her.

      In a flash, she withdraws the crescent wrench. She cocks her
      wrist back and hurls the tool, snaps it just like her daddy
      taught her to play baseball.

      The wrench flies up and across the house.

      With a CRUNCH, it catches Chuckie right in the collar bone,
      right side.

      He screams. Drops the flashlight. Drops to his knees holding
      his throat.

      Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. She
      throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between
      Tomas and Huey.

                                               Scene 96Page 54
       


      Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands with
      his face down, biting on the plank's edge.

      Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towards
      her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of
      Huey's neck. Grinds Huey's face into the plank with a hideous
      THUD. Huey's neck SNAPS back smiley style. Huey's scream
      gurgles into the night. Huey's body falls through the space
      in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations
      below.

      Tomas falls away, cursing in horror.

                            TOMAS (CONT'D)
                Maricon!

      Della makes a run for the doorway. She jumps down onto the
      muddy lot and heads off across the development. The darkness
      quickly swallows her.

      Behind her, Vinh slumps through the house.

                          VINH
                What the fuck, niggaz?

                            CHUCKIE
                Shut up.

                            VINH
                You hurt?

                          CHUCKIE
                SHUT THE FUCK UP.

      Chuckie slides down to be beside Huey in the foundations.

                          CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                And don't be using the N word. You
                ain't representing. GOT IT. That
                right Huey? HUEY. Get up Huey. HUEY
                GET UP!

      Tomas staggers up to standing.

                          TOMAS
                Jesus hijo de maria el virgene.

                            VINH
                What?

      Vinh moves towards Chuckie who is crouched over Huey.

                                               Scene 96Page 55
       


                           CHUCKIE
                 My little brother.

      Tomas approaches.

      He pushes Chuckie gently out of the way so he can see.

      He stares down at Huey's bloody meshed face. Tomas staggers
      backwards and crosses himself.

                           TOMAS
                 Mamacita! Madre de Dios!

      Chuckie punches Tomas' leg.

                           CHUCKIE
                 You tread on my boy's face. YOU
                 KILLED HIM.

                           TOMAS
                 I didn't kill him. I didn't kill no
                 one.

      Tomas pushes Chuckie backwards.

                           TOMAS (CONT'D)
                 She did it. She killed him.

      Chuckie and Tomas stare at each other.

                           TOMAS (CONT'D)
                 I'm gonna cross that bitch out.

97                                                              97
      EXT.   WOODS - EVENING

      Della runs for her life. She makes straight for the cover of
      the trees. She hesitates for just a moment after the first
      layer of Pines. It's pitch black beyond. Then she steps in.

      She follows her breath into the icy blackness.

      Branches and foliage scratch against her face.

      She grapples about, looking for hiding places between the
      dark shapes and forms. Steps between tree roots and shrubs.

      Her eyes begin to adjust. She can now make out the
      difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking
      back, where the edge of the woods begins. A construction
      light shines behind like a distant moon.

                                      Scene 97Page 56
       


      She pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees,
      some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. Only the
      evergreens still have their foliage.

      Looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign
      of the boys.

      Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the
      trees grow even more densely together. Where there just may
      be the right place to hide.

      She stops for a second to catch her breath.

      The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. She
      changes hands.

      God, that boy Huey! He really died back there. She heard the
      sound of it. The horrific sound of him dying a stupid
      pointless death.

      It could have been her.

      There has to be some way out of this nightmare.

      Ahead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path.
      She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots.

                          CHUCKIE
                DELLA!

      Chuckie's voice drifts towards her.   She ducks down among the
      roots.

      Her eyes scan the darkness.

      No moving shapes nor forms. No sound. No flashlight. Just
      shadowy clumps of trees.

      Should she stay put or should she run?

      Then she sees it. The flashlight weaving through the pines
      ahead.

      She pushes further in among the roots, tries to make herself
      invisible.

      The flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards
      her. One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage.

      She holds still, terrified.

      The flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots.

                                       Scene 97Page 57
       


      Della stops breathing.

      Then, the light sweeps past and on into the woods.

      She waits until it disappears before stepping out of her
      hiding place.

      She creeps back in the opposite direction, figuring if
      they're in the woods now she should get out.

      Her eyes search for the construction light, which indicates
      the edge of the wood.

      She heads in the direction of the light, painfully aware that
      one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers. She steps
      between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer.

      The construction light grows closer.

      The light abruptly goes out.

      She stops, eyes desperately searching the trees.

      She resumes in the direction she was headed. Tries to keep
      calm.

      But the woods are impenetrable. Layers of trees and shrubs,
      and then more trees. Deep in the cold dark places there are
      patches of left over snow. She's losing her bearings.

98                                                                 98
      EXT. X'D TREES - EVENING

      Ahead, the chilling sight of four luminous Xs glowing in the
      dark forest almost makes her heart stop. She realizes the
      crosses are painted on the trunks of several trees, marking
      them for death. She shivers.

99                                                                 99
      EXT. WOODS -EVENING

      She backs up, starts off in the opposite direction.

      And there it is again. The flashlight sweeping through the
      trees in the distance.

      She stops, close to screaming, then when the flashlight
      disappears, runs off in yet another direction.

      She slows to take a breath, notices the butts of several
      cigarettes still smoking in the dirt close to her feet.

                                       Scene 99Page 58
       


                             DELLA
                   (muttering to herself)
                   Shit! Oh Shit!

      She trudges on, pushing between the branches, no clue where
      she is headed.

      The further she treads, the quieter it becomes. So quiet she
      can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees
      breathing.

      Then, she spots the light again, in the distance, shining out
      over the forest.

      Thank God!

      She trudges up a slope ahead, clinging onto branches and
      shrubs to help pull herself up.

100                                                              100
      EXT. LEDGE - EVENING

      The light grows closer. She climbs up onto a ledge.

      A loud noise startles her. It's music. Rap music. Blasting.

      Della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees.
      Sees....

101                                                              101
      EXT.   CLEARING - EVENING

      The woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing, where a huge
      ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees. Young pines
      about to become Christmas trees. It's blasting out a hip hop
      anthem for a dead homie. A construction light illuminates the
      clearing.

      A ghostly Vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of
      beer in hand.

      Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey, arms
      crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face.

      The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer. She
      creeps along the edge of the trees.

      As she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. It tumbles
      downhill into the gulch. She freezes.

      But nobody notices.

      She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas
      enters the clearing.

                                               Scene 101Page 59
       


       Tomas stops and watches Vinh.

       Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese
       punk style. The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music
       and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that
       this is really important music to him.

       It's a theatrical tableau -

       Della overhead, looking down on the clearing.

       Vinh transfixed by the music.

       Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh.

       It plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of
       some spiritual rite about to be consummated.

       Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small
       tear runs down his stoic face.

       Then CLICK. The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who
       appears out of the shadows behind it.

       He stares a beat at Vinh like he can't believe what he's been
       seeing.

       Vinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance.

                           CHUCKIE
                 What the fuck you doing?

       Vinh doesn't reply. Stares down at the ground, keeps on with
       his weird dance. Chuckie moves towards him. Tomas grabs
       Chuckie, tries to stop him from going for Vinh, but Chuckie
       shrugs him off.

       Chuckie reaches out and shakes Vinh. No response. He shakes
       him again.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I asked you what your deal is, sand
                 dancer?

       The second shake sort of breaks Vinh out of his trance. He
       shivers.

                           VINH
                 It's a tribute. A gesture.

                           CHUCKIE
                 A what?

                                               Scene 101Page 60
       


       Vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Your brain even smaller than 'em
                 slits for eyes?

       Vinh slouches defiantly over to the blaster and presses track
       8 replay.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Keep on banging out that ghetto ass
                 shit and you'll alert every cop in
                 Podunk county.

                           VINH
                 It's for Huey. Our dead homie.

       The song starts again. Chuckie looks at him incredulously,
       shouts above the music.

                           CHUCKIE
                 You checked out, right?

                           VINH
                 He loved that track.

       Vinh snorts back a sob. He hugs himself into a hunch and
       starts dancing again.

       Chuckie loses it. He slaps Vinh.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Get a grip, skippy.

       Vinh rubs his face. He's getting a grip all right. Chuckie
       slams off the blaster.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Huey's DEAD. And ain't no requiem
                 gonna resurrect his ass. He down
                 under the ground now with the real
                 men of respect.

       The three boys stand somberly in silence, each paying
       internal homage to their dead friend. Chuckie hardens his
       heart against the tears that threaten to flow. Tomas
       trembles, mumbles.

                           TOMAS
                 I didn't mean it. I didn't do it. I
                 didn't mean to kill him.

                                               Scene 101Page 61
       


       This breaks the moment. Chuckie snaps back.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Well he dead. That's it for him.
                 OVER. But we still here. Hell,
                 yeah. Payback's gonna be a real
                 bitch for a real bitch.

       Vinh wipes away his tears.

                           VINH
                 She probably gone by now.

                           CHUCKIE
                 You best hope not, genius. She
                 gone, we gone.

       Chuckie paces around the circumference of the clearing.

                              CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 DELLA!

102                                                              102
       EXT. LEDGE - EVENING

       Della's been watching the scene unfold, a captive audience,
       attentive and terrified.

       Slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys. She backs away
       from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old
       tree. The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she
       hurt earlier on the barbed wire.

       She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. She
       reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. Nothing. Feels
       something in her pants pocket.

       She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper.

       She unfolds it. It's Tammi's drawing. The one from the
       beginning.

       The stick figure family holding hands and "Mommy - We love
       you" written in stars.

       Della's lost in the drawing. Her eyes drink in every mark and
       color and word. She sees that the male figure is slightly
       separate. That the children stick figures have frightened
       eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. The
       stars clear and bright. The words...

       A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. A
       sob.

                                               Scene 102Page 62
       


       She might never see her kids again.

       Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion.

       More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back.
       Wills herself to stop.

       Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self
       recrimination.

       Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some
       stupid note! And God knows what will become of the kids.

       Kenneth always told her she had a temper. That she reacts
       without thinking of the consequences. This time the bastard
       was right.

       She looks again at the picture.

       Chuckie's voice booms out into the night.

                           CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                 D-E-L-L-A, H-O-N-E-Y.

       She folds the picture up carefully and puts it back in her
       pocket.

       Della edges further into the trees and disappears into the
       darkness.

       There's rustling in the darkness. Tomas pushes through the
       edge of the trees, making animal calls with his right hand
       curled around his mouth. The flashlight illuminates him from
       behind.

       Chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of
       classic noir style. Vinh slouches behind them.

       Tomas heads along the ledge, straight past the spot where
       Della stood only moments before. Tomas doubles back.

       Thomas stops, sniffs.

                           TOMAS
                 I can smell her Bulgari.

       Chuckie's behind him surveying the area with the flashlight.
       He finds several footprints by the tree.

                           CHUCKIE
                 She was right here. Must a saw your
                 dumb ass tribute and everything.

                                               Scene 102Page 63
       


       Vinh glares at Chuckie. Chuckie grins at Tomas.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Bulgari? She looks more like she
                 rocks that number five shit.

                           TOMAS
                 It Bulgari, dude. My Dad's bitch
                 bathes in it.

       Chuckie points the flashlight towards where the ledge ends
       and a steep incline begins.

103                                                               103
       EXT. STEEP INCLINE - EVENING

       The flashlight illuminates a set of prints descending down
       the incline.

                           CHUCKIE
                 There more of her footprints.

       Tomas and Vinh just stand like zombies.

       Chuckie pushes Vinh.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 What you waiting on? Jackie Chan?

       Vinh plods clumsily down the incline, followed by Tomas.

       Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a
       sign of Della.

       Chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope. As
       the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of
       Della between some rocks at the far side. But the boys' eyes
       are elsewhere, focused on the steep incline ahead of them.

       Della quickly ducks, draws her toolbox in tight and crouches
       low between the rocks. She watches the boys carefully as they
       climb down the gulch.

       There's the sound of a stumble followed by a splash.

                              VINH (O.S.)
                 SHIT!

                           TOMAS (O.S.)
                 What now, cabron?

                           VINH (O.S.)
                 Fell in a frozen ass stream.

                                               Scene 103Page 64
       


       Chuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them. Della sees Vinh
       trudging out of the stream, Tomas descending the last few
       feet of the other side of the gulch and Chuckie midway up.

       Vinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his
       sneakers.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Zipperhead!

                           VINH
                 Kon'aro Kusotare.

                           CHUCKIE
                 You know we don't speak the Chinky.

                           VINH
                 What's your game, Chuckie? We left
                 stumbling around in the dark while
                 you hog the flashlight.

                           CHUCKIE
                 I stole it. I get to use it. That's
                 how it works. That right Tomas?

                           TOMAS
                 Right on, dog.

       Chuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins Vinh and
       Tomas at the edge of the stream.

                           VINH
                 What if I steal it from you?

                           CHUCKIE
                 There you go, bro.

       He hands the flashlight over to Vinh. Vinh reaches for it.
       Chuckie pulls it away.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 April Fool. Naw, wait a minute, it
                 ain't April. Must be Christmas
                 fool.

       Tomas smirks. Vinh hangs his head down. They search for more
       prints, can't find any in the immediate area. Chuckie shines
       the flashlight at the foot of a big rock.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Her footprints disappear at the big
                 rock.

                                               Scene 103Page 65
       


       A beat. Della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand.

       Vinh shivers violently.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Head on up and search the slope.
                 I'll guide your way with the
                 flashlight.

       Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch. Della ducks.

       Della needs to get out of there and fast.

       They begin to ascend the rocks. Chuckie keeps the flashlight
       slightly ahead of them.

       Della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping
       as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light.

       The boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the
       dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees
       and hands to shreds.

       She can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin.
       What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed.

                           TOMAS
                 We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch!

       God please help her make it back into the cover of the trees.

       Della almost vomits.

       Her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. She
       pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. Her strength is ebbing
       but she tries to hoist herself up. The flashlight sweeps by.
       She lets go of the ledge and ducks. The flashlight sweeps by
       again.

       She huddles in behind a rock. Waits a beat.

                           TOMAS (CONT'D)
                 You going home in a casket tonight.

       Oh shit, they're approaching fast. She tries again to hoist
       herself up. She's almost up when the flashlight sweeps by
       again.

       This time, it catches her.

                           CHUCKIE
                 THERE SHE IS, TOP OF THE GULCH!

                                               Scene 103Page 66
       


       She practically throws herself over the ledge. Tomas scurries
       to the top faster than lightening, catches her leg as she
       crawls from the edge.

       THUD. She kicks him in the face.

       Della grabs the toolbox. Makes a run for it.

                           TOMAS
                 AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH!

       Tomas falls back from the gulch-side, loosening several
       rocks. The rocks tumble downhill, hit Vinh.

                              VINH
                 AHHHHHHH!

       Chuckie scales the gulch behind them. Vinh rubs his head.
       Sees something between the trees. Thinks it's Huey.

                              VINH (CONT'D)
                 Huey?

       He starts towards the brush.

                           VINH (CONT'D)
                 Is that you, homie?

       Chuckie catches up with Vinh, breathless from climbing fast.
       Vinh points into the brush.

                           VINH (CONT'D)
                 I saw Huey, there in the brush.

                              CHUCKIE
                 What?

       Chuckie looks around, hoping against hope that Vinh may be
       right, that Huey may just be alive. Vinh becomes perplexed.

                              VINH
                 I saw him.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Sure you did, bro.

       Chuckie puts his arm around Vinh and helps him up the rock
       side. Vinh is shivering so hard he's almost sobbing.

       Just ahead Tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge.

                                                 Scene 104Page 67

       EXT.   WOODS - EVENING

       Tomas catches up with Della, chases her into the trees.
       Behind him Vinh hoists himself up over the ledge, then
       Chuckie.

       Della runs. Faster than she's ever run before. Practically
       flies through the trees.

       Her breath comes hard. His too, just behind her. Their
       footfalls crash into the foliage.

       It's dark, so dark. She's running blindly.

       And they're right behind her. Tomas swipes at her. He just
       misses. He swipes again.

       A twisted shape looms ahead, almost blocks her path.

       She runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment,
       setting up Thomas who's right behind her.

       Tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk, hits
       himself at groin level. He doubles over in pain.

                            TOMAS
                  CONEJO! AIN'T NUTHIN' CAN SAVE YO
                  ASS NOW.

       Della races on.

       Thomas gathers himself together, picks up the chase.

       But that moment's delay has bought her some time.

       Her adrenaline pumps hard. Eyes darting for a hiding place
       among the dark shapes and planes of the woods.

105                                                              105
       EXT. DEADWOOD PILE - EVENING

       There it is, a deadwood pile.

       She throws herself down into its midst. The dried branches
       jag and tear at her hands and face. She burrows down low, so
       low she's right in the dirt. She peers between the branches.

       Tomas's feet run by and disappear. She hears him circle the
       area then turn back towards her.

       A moment passes. She picks the next. Rises slowly and softly
       from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench.

                                       Scene 105Page 68
       


       And then there he is. Diving out of the trees towards her.

       Della raises the lug wrench.

       In the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a
       woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross.

       Tomas crashes towards her.

       Della swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at
       Tomas's face.

       There is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches
       him up under the chin. It sends him reeling.

       He goes down face first.

       Della gasps in horror, watches as:

       Tomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once
       more.

       Della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the
       head.

       He spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her
       AGAIN.

       She loses it. She swings the lug wrench towards him.    All the
       years of pent up rage finally find their release.

       The wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH.
       It drives the cartilage up and into his face.

       Blood spurts from the wound. He staggers backwards.

       A shocked scream escapes from Della's mouth.

                            DELLA
                 Awwwrgh!

       As she staggers backwards in the opposite direction.

       Tomas tries to cry out but can only utter in pain.

                           TOMAS
                 Unnh! Unnh! Unnh!

       He tries to pull the lug wrench out of his face. Spins.
       Stumbles.

       The flashlight beam travels past them.

                                               Scene 105Page 69
       


                           TOMAS (CONT'D)
                 Unnh!

       Tomas crashes back into a tree. He loses consciousness. His
       body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. Blood
       gushes from where the wrench meets his face. He looks like
       he's dressed for Halloween.

       Della just stares. Stares at Tomas, at what she did, what she
       had to do.

       Tomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead.

       The horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della. She
       starts shaking with shock.

       Vinh cries out for Tomas

                           VINH (O.S.)
                 TOMAS!

       The sound of footfalls crashing through the brush follows.

                           CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                 Curb the squealing. You a gangsta
                 or a boy scout?

       Vinhs voice is breathless and jittery.

                           VINH (O.S.)
                 Tomas's gone, Chuckie. I can feel
                 it.

       Della tears herself away from Tomas's body and staggers into
       the deadwood to collect the toolbox. It glints, even in the
       darkness.

       She grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree.

       Behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the
       flashlight illuminates Vinh and Chuckie as they march through
       the woods searching for Tomas.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Tomas is one hard son of a bitch.
                 He got her strung up from a tree by
                 now and you know it.

       But Chuckie doesn't look so sure. Vinh charges ahead into the
       darkness.

                                               Scene 105Page 70
       


       Della flashes briefly into shot, running between the trees.
       The flashlight sweeps by.

                           VINH
                 There's something over here.

       Chuckie walks towards Vinh. Vinh takes the flashlight from
       Chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three
       trees.

                           VINH (CONT'D)
                 It looks like a body.

       They close in on a muddle of shapes, bush and spidery tree
       trunks. The flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and
       thick as a body.

                           CHUCKIE
                 It's a big old tree trunk, you
                 paranoid gook.

       Chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh
       won't give it. Chuckie doesn't persist. Vinh keeps going,
       shivering and blustering.

       Vinh senses something. He shines the flashlight behind the
       tree trunk. Still nothing. Sweeps back.

       Della darts between the evergreens behind them. She conceals
       herself in between the trunks and branches. Braces herself,
       waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not
       looking, to run between the trees. Cognizant enough to know
       they just want to find Tomas right now. She seems to be on
       autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on.

       She watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush. He hits
       every inch of it with the flashlight. Sighs. Doubles back to
       follow Chuckie.

       Then, the flashlight catches a glimpse of something. Sweeps
       back, illuminates Tomas's dead body, splayed out on the mud
       at the foot of the tree, eyes staring wide, bloody, ghastly.

       Tomas's Catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight.

       Silence until Vinh falls to his knees in front of Tomas,
       tries to speak but only a whisper comes out.

                           VINH
                 Tomas.....IYAH!

                                               Scene 105Page 71
       


       Chuckie realizes from Vinh's demeanor that something really
       is wrong. He hesitates a moment, then rushes over to Vinh,
       stares too at Tomas's body, gulps back the desire to scream.

       He punches his fist hard into the tree behind Tomas' body
       instead. A shower of pine needles rains down on them.

       Chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the
       body, grabs Vinh's arm, grounding him.

       Vinh sobs and shakes.

                           VINH (CONT'D)
                 She gonna kill you and me next.
                 We're all gonna die here. God knows
                 what other tools she got in that
                 box.

                           CHUCKIE
                 It was a stupid ass accident killed
                 Huey. You know that. And Tomas....

       Chuckie chokes up despite himself.

       He stands up, brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt.

       He paces back and forth.

       He pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans.

       Della creeps between the trees behind them. She appears for a
       second or two, like a ghost, behind the next tree.

       Chuckie defiantly fights back tears.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I promise you this.

       He kisses the gun.

                            CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 This baby's gonna cancel her
                 Christmas.

       Della darts between the trees, faster now. Their voices
       follow her.

                           VINH (O.S.)
                 Ain't no gun can kill a ghost gone
                 bad.

                                                 Scene 105Page 72
       


       She staggers deeper and deeper into the forest, into the
       darkness.

                            CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                  You in America now, dude, where the
                  ghosts bleed.

       She hears a faint gurgle.

       She slows, listens. It's the burble of a stream..

       She listens hard. Traces the sound. Treads towards it.

       There it is. Glistening, even in the dark.

106                                                               106
       EXT.   STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING

       She steps between rocks, walks straight into the stream
       below.

       She stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed
       clutching the toolbox.

       The water gurgles faintly below her, so cold it almost sounds
       like glass breaking.

       The ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her
       eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered
       for all time.

         She's talking to herself in a whisper.

                               DELLA
                  I'm sorry.

       All she knows is that she just killed a boy. It may have been
       in self defense but she killed him.

                            DELLA (CONT'D)
                  I'm so sorry!

       The grief overcomes her silently. Her face crumples. Her
       stomach muscles spasm and wrack through her body. A grief so
       deep tears would be a relief.

                            DELLA (CONT'D)
                  Where are you, God?

       She falls to her knees in the stream. Holding herself and
       rocking. The freezing water seeps up into her clothes, her
       hair.

                                       Scene 106Page 73
       


                           DELLA (CONT'D)
                 Please, I just want to see my
                 babies again.

       Her rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close
       by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the
       toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree
       and drags down into the stream behind her.

       This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's
       only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She
       needs to get moving.

       She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow
       water. Her wet coat drags heavily.

       The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of
       the woods.

       She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping
       trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream.

       Forging ahead.

       She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up.

       She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's
       probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will
       be dispersed.

       A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the
       stream. She makes her way toward it.

       She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the
       branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling
       down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the
       side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water
       meeting the stream.

       More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants,
       smoothing down her coat.

       She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up
       the toolbox.

       She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light
       that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to
       the mall lights, closer to home.

       She swallows another wave of grief.

                                               Scene 106Page 74
       


       The stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She
       follows it, picks the left fork.

       And then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering
       down into the stream behind her.

       She doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her
       life.

       The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing
       water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her
       feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running.

       Vinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his
       hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster.

       She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap
       behind her.

       She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees.
       Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes,
       right into Vinh's face.

       He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries
       out, covers his eyes.

                             VINH
                 Aaaarrhh.

       This buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends
       right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs
       along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her.

       But the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He
       leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's
       outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her.

       Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting
       its direction.

       Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five
       feet behind her.

       A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in
       a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd
       forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun.

       Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder,
       hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces
       herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever.

                                               Scene 106Page 75
       


       The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a
       moment she's invisible to them. She uses it. When she reaches
       the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of
       Chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks.

107                                                               107
       EXT.   EMBANKMENT - EVENING

       She creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows
       of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will
       allow.

       The boys stop by the rocks. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up
       the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her.

       She tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid
       leaving prints. Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when
       she sees the flashlight sweep by.

       If she can get to the top, she can make another run for it.

       All of a sudden, it grows dark. The boys must have switched
       the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. She listens
       hard for their footfalls. Nothing.

108                                                               108
       EXT. PINE TREE - EVENING

       She sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree.

       She creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently
       slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver.
       She removes it from the box and grasps it tight.

       Della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. She
       reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction
       of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. She pulls
       herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk.
       She peeks between the branches.

       No sign of the boys. She pulls herself further up into the
       tree, branch by branch.

       The thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little
       needles, fall like a jagged veil around her.

       She waits.

       She's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape
       below despite the darkness.

       She makes out the faint echo of voices, strains to hear.

                                      Scene 109Page 76
       


109                                                                109
       EXT. STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING

       Vinh and Chuckie are arguing in whispers. Vinh's pale and
       shivering hard.

                           VINH
                 I don't feel good, Chuckie. You
                 think I got the hypothermia?

                           CHUCKIE
                 Nah, yo got the yellow fever.

       Vinh sulks.

                           VINH
                 I'm telling you, it ain't natural
                 how she gets away every time.

       Chuckie clicks the flashlight back on. Sweeps it up, across
       and back down the embankment to the stream, illuminating the
       banks.

                           CHUCKIE
                 She got to be hiding up on the
                 slope? You head up first and I'll
                 follow with the flashlight.

       The light sweeps past her. Della shrinks further into the
       branches of the tree. She crunches her foot against a branch.
       SHIT!

       The boys freeze, then resume talking in whispers.


                           VINH
                 I ain't going up there without the
                 gun. End of story.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Never would've pegged you as a
                 pussy, Vinh. Even when Huey and
                 Tomas called it, I always defended
                 your ass.

                           VINH
                 Ain't no one never said I was a
                 pussy.

                           CHUCKIE
                 She a skinny ass bitch, too. Can't
                 be weighing in at more than one
                 twenty.

                                       Scene 109Page 77
       


                           VINH
                 Tomas an Huey never called me a
                 pussy.

                           CHUCKIE
                 I ain't speaking ill o' the dead.

                           VINH
                 You already did.

       Vinh's shivering so hard his teeth are knocking.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Anyways, when you ever shot a gun?
                 Probably miss and shoot yourself in
                 the foot.

       Vinh paces, braces himself to head up after Della.

110                                                               110
       EXT. EMBANKMENT - EVENING

       Vinh starts to ascend the embankment.

                           CHUCKIE
                 That's the spirit gangsta. Holler
                 if you see her and I'll shoot.

       Vinh glares back at Chuckie.

                           VINH
                 Faito!

       Della watches Vinh plough through the brush.

       The flashlight sweeps and darts with his movements, up ahead
       of him, up the embankment.

       Vinh pushes through several trees, slips, regains his
       footing. He plods past the tree. She slips the screwdriver up
       her sleeve. Prays he won't stop.

       She pulls herself further up the tree.

       A sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her, followed
       by a shower of pine needles.

       Her heart stops.

       A moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by
       the squawking of angry birds.

       She's disturbed a bird's nest.

                                      Scene 110Page 78
       


       She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst
       through the branches above and up into the patch of sky
       between.

       The crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus.

       She looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches
       along a branch to see better.

       The light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye
       line, disorienting her.

       She hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree.

       Her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh
       standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her.
       She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath.

       The flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away
       up the embankment.

       But Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under
       the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up
       through the branches.

       Their eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie.

       She LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back.

                           VINH (CONT'D)
                 CHUUUCCKKKKIEEE!

       She silences his yell with a choke hold. Wraps her legs
       around his torso. He bites her arm but she holds tight.

                           CHUCKIE (O.S.)
                 Vinh?

       Panic has crept into Chuckie's voice.

                           CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                 VINH?

       Vinh topples to the mud, dragging Della with him.

       They roll as he desperately tries to disengage her.

       The flashlight frantically searches the area for them.

       Della frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve.

       She DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull.

                                                Scene 110Page 79
       


       Vinh screams.

       She thrusts and twists the tool.

       All the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined,
       intimate as a lover.

       She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her
       knuckles dig into his stiff hair.

       Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail.

       The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It
       protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a
       stream of blood.

       His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins.

       They roll downstream.

       His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her.

       They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds
       of the way down.

       She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He
       becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies
       right there on top of her.

       She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds
       the strength to push him off.

       She crawls out from under his body.

       Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again.

         She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head
       hurts so bad it's about to burst.

       The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails
       follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to
       close it all out almost overwhelms her.

       Her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm
       where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and
       rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark.

       There's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes,
       looks around.

       It's Vinh's body hitting the stream below.

                                                Scene 110Page 80
       


       Where was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be
       seen now that's for sure.

       She staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and
       roots as she goes.

       Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy
       slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing,
       reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up.

       Plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a
       diagonal through the darkness.

       She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more
       darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like
       she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.

                              CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Della?

       When she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her, she
       almost smiles.

       She knows he's coming for her and there's nothing she can do
       about it.

       Della shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead: four huge
       felled trees wrapped in white plastic. Their sad stumps are
       only feet away. It's the funeral parlour of the forest.

                              CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                  Delllaaa?


111                                                             111
       EXT.   FELLED TREES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC - EVENING

       Della sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped
       tree. She listens hard, tries to fathom which direction he's
       coming from.

       His voice drifts in and out of proximity like he's pacing
       around in circles. His voice has changed - he's dropped the
       gangster schtick.

                            CHUCKIE
                  There's only you and me, now.

       Maybe, if he wanders into the right position, she can sneak
       up on him from behind. She rakes about in the dirt looking
       for a rock or a stick. Then she remembers something, sticks
       her hand in her pocket, half smiles.

                                               Scene 111Page 81
       


                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I saw a little trail of your blood
                 back there. You must be hurt.

       Della checks out the bite mark on her arm to find it's still
       bleeding.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I'm hurting too. I think you busted
                 up my collarbone.

       His black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I know you can hear me, Della.

       Chuckie sniffs.

                           CHUCKIE?
                 I can smell your blood, your sweat.
                 I know you're close.

       Chuckie's eyes glint in the darkness.

                           CHUCKIE
                 After what went down tonight, we
                 got a special bond.

       Della listens, transfixed.

       His dark shape beckons to her.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 May as well come out now, Della.

       She doesn't move.

       She watches him pace around trying to work out where she is.

       He pulls out a pack of cigarettes, taps one out, lights it.
       Inhales. Exhales.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I'll save one for you, for when you
                 decide to come out.

       He inhales again, exhales.

       He laughs admiringly.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 You're one tough bitch.

                                               Scene 111Page 82
       


       The tone of his voice begins to change.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 And that's hot, hell yeah.

       Frustration breaks through his voice. She can see his shadowy
       form moving through the darkness towards her. He stops.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 And they're really cute.

       Chuckie clicks on the flashlight, shines it straight ahead -
       right in between the plastic wrapped trees.

       Della freezes.   They?

       Chuckie's eyes penetrate the darkness.

                              CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Twins huh?     Terri and Tammi.

       Della doesn't move. Terrified.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I bet you could use that cigarette
                 now Della honey?
                     (he chuckles)
                 A woman's purse can tell her whole
                 life story!

       Della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in
       his jacket. He empties the contents out onto the dirt.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Now I know where they are living,
                 I'm thinking I may stop by after
                 and say hello.

       Della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates.
       But she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to
       give him the satisfaction.

       We move in closer on Chuckie. He's looking right at where
       she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 They wouldn't know a damn thing
                 about what happened to Mommy while
                 she was out, would they, Della?

                                                Scene 111Page 83
       


       We move in on Della. Her knuckles are blue white and her eyes
       are blazing. Rage explodes in her. She doesn't even realize
       that she is shouting till she's done.

                           DELLA
                 I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

       Chuckie waltzes towards her hiding place.

                           CHUCKIE
                 I figured that would help you find
                 your voice!

       Della crouches further in behind the felled trees. Why the
       hell did she shout? She could have been hiding anywhere. Now
       he must know for sure where she is.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Don't worry. I would never touch
                 them. It's wrong to hurt kids!
                 Right, Della?

       She clamps her mouth closed. Chuckie continues waltzing
       toward her, stops about twelve feet away. He stares in
       between the felled trees like he has x-ray vision.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 The game's over.

       Chuckie laughs.

                            CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 You won!

       Sadness creeps into his voice.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 You took him from me...He was only
                 seventeen years old. And all he
                 ever wanted to do was see the
                 ocean. And he never saw it. No, he
                 never got to go.

       Chuckie's grief sits like a stone in his throat.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 They're all gone now.

       Chuckie coughs, a dry laboured cough. He hocks long and
       deeply in his throat. But whatever it is he can't spit it
       out. He rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly.

                                               Scene 111Page 84
       


                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                   You know the movie "Clockwork
                   Orange"?

       Della looks puzzled.   Yeah, and?

                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                   Well, they were my droogies, Della.

       Chuckie sighs.

                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                   Chances are they would of turned on
                   me anyway, just like in the movie.

       Chuckie paces around, deep in thought.

                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                   None of them was real ass outlaw.
                   No, not in the way you are.
                   You're the real deal, lady.

       He stops.

                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                   I was already thinking about
                   cutting some of em loose, getting a
                   new style posse together.

       Della's head is spinning.

                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                   How's about it, you and me?

       This can't be real. Has he lost his mind? She utters under
       her breath.

                             DELLA
                   Give me a break.

       Chuckie reaches down, retrieves her diary from the dirt. She
       cringes.

                             CHUCKIE
                   Monday night mechanics. Tuesday
                   Pilates. Wednesday Spanish.
                   Thursday, I wish....

       He closes the diary.

                                               Scene 111Page 85
       


                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Face it, Della. You ain't no
                 suburban housewife.

       Chuckie's eyes dart around in the darkness.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 So you bought into the big lie,
                 even tried to live it. Who could
                 blame you? Husband, kids, security,
                 every woman's dream, but not yours,
                 Della. You know there ain't no such
                 thing as security.

       He coughs some more.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 But I'm betting you didn't really
                 know who you were until tonight. I
                 reckon I know what you've been
                 dreaming about though, what you've
                 been aching for, through all these
                 lonely, wasted years. Blasting out
                 of Podunk without never looking
                 back. Feeling the wind in your hair
                 and the dirt of life between your
                 fingers. Doing all the things they
                 told you you ain't supposed to do.
                 Taking what YOU want from life. And
                 wasting anyone who stands in your
                 way. Right, Della?

       She closes her eyes like she's seeing it all behind them.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Don't say you ain't thought about
                 it. If it's in your blood, it's in
                 your blood for all time.

       A longing sigh sneaks out.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 You had yourself fooled, Della.

       A single tear runs down her cheek.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Shit, lady, you took my whole crew
                 out with nothing but a bunch of
                 them tools.

       She opens her eyes.

                                         Scene 111Page 86
       


                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 You can't go back to your old life.
                 No way. It's all over for that.
                 Kaboom.

       She doesn't know what to say.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 Hooking up with me's about the best
                 chance you got.

       He sounds deadly serious, seductive even. She's lost in some
       kind of trance, looking like she just might believe him.

       Can she possibly be believing this?

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I bet you're on the outs with your
                 old man.

       She inhales sharply.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 When we pick up your kids, we can
                 waste him if you like.

       She holds the breath in.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 I can do it. Or you can if you're
                 ready.

       Della exhales, responds.       She seems lost to us.

                              DELLA
                 I want...

       But she doesn't finish the sentence. She rises slowly from
       between the plastic wrapped trees.

       A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face. Then, their
       eyes meet, like for the first time. It catches them both by
       surprise. He smiles.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Leave the tools.

                           DELLA
                 I already did.

       He shines the flashlight on her path so that she can see
       where she is walking.

                                      Scene 111Page 87
       


       Della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the
       stumps. She heads towards him, slowly, deliberately.

       Chuckie's hands are by his sides. She stops a few feet away
       from him.

       She can see him up close. The clearest view of him yet. They
       both look like they've been to hell.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Hell of a night, huh?

       He lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to
       point up through the trees and into the sky between them.

                           DELLA
                 I was only going to the mall for
                 some Christmas wrapping paper.

       Chuckie smiles.

                           CHUCKIE
                 Shit happens.

       They stare at one another, all alone in the night. A knowing
       moment stretches between them.

       She notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his
       collarbone.

                              DELLA
                 What now?

       Chuckie smiles, brings his teeth back into a scary, feral
       grin.

                           CHUCKIE
                 I wanted to look you in the eye
                 before I kill you.

       Della doesn't react.    He brings up his hand, gun clutched,
       pointed and ready.

       Della surprises him and us.

                           DELLA
                 That's what I figured.

       She nods her head, points her chin over his shoulder.

                           DELLA (CONT'D)
                 Huey there, going to help?

                                      Scene 111Page 88
       


       Chuckie is puzzled.

                            CHUCKIE
                 Huey?   Huey's ....

       He glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as
       he turns his head. It's enough. Della slips the flare out of
       her pocket and opens it in his face.

       Before he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all
       the spring left in her legs. Her fingers close around the
       wrist with the gun.

       The flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them.

       She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his
       collar bone is broken. It makes the ugly noise of sinew
       tearing.

                             CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 CHRIST!

       She tumbles him down to the December ground and wraps her
       legs tight around him. Tight like a lover.

       She grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his
       broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound.

       He cries out, thrashes about. She keeps her body melded to
       his, grinding her chin even deeper.

       He wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even
       closer, wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone.

       They roll across the dirt.   He whispers, low and close to
       her.

                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
                 You're even better than I thought.

       He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin
       returning to the wound. She tries to pull away but he only
       presses harder.

       Neither can break away.

       It's unclear who's got the gun.

       They roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up.

       But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock.

                                      Scene 111Page 89
       


       And she has the gun.

       They look at each other. He smiles.

       He makes for the gun.

       She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough.

       His legs release. He slumps back.   Blood darkens his shirt.

       Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps
       below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark
       puddle.

       His body surrenders to death.

       She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She
       stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal.

       His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently.

       And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float
       away. Somehow she stands up.

       She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could
       be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the
       pool of blood.

       She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from
       its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there;
       tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's
       mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket
       closed.

       She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds
       her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax
       box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her
       purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them
       half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more
       finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway.

       It's time to go home.

112                                                              112
       EXT. WOODS - EVENING

       Without really thinking about it, Della slips the gun into
       her pocket and starts running.

       Tree after tree disappears behind her until she sees the
       light ahead. That place where the rest of the world meets the
       woods.

                                               Scene 112Page 90
       


       She peers through the last layer of trees like she would a
       curtain to her other reality, the one she almost left behind.

       The housing development is still there and not more than a
       hundred feet away is her car.

       She hears the sound of distant sirens.

113                                                              113
       EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING

       She hurries across the clearing towards her car. Sees the
       trunk is open. Sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about.
       Sees the big red bow tangled around a pine.

       She quickly gathers them, stuffs them in her purse.

       A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car. What if it's
       locked? What if the keys are gone?

       She presses the Ford's driver door handle and much to her
       relief, it opens. She sees the keys still dangling from the
       ignition.

114                                                              114
       INT. EXPLORER- EVENING

       She climbs into the driver's seat and turns the key. No
       connection. No surprises there!

115                                                              115
       EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING

       She steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like
       nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again.

       The hood is still ajar by a few inches, the weight of pine
       branches still pressing upon it. She uses the last of her
       strength to try push them away. A few smaller branches give
       way but the bigger one won't budge.

       She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard. It
       scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it
       to prop the hood open to its maximum, about fifteen inches.
       The hood buckles but there's enough room for her to reach in.

       She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose
       from its attachment to the battery. She re-attaches the wire
       and, Presto, the car lights up and the keys start to ping.

       She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down. The hood
       slams down after it.

                                               Scene 116Page 91
       


116                                                               116
       INT. FORD - EVENING

       She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys. The
       engine sputters but doesn't fully catch. She turns the keys
       again - another wimpy sputter. Again, this time the sputter
       gathers momentum, catches for a second, gives up. She tries
       again, the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real.

       Della looks over her shoulder and backs up, pulls out of the
       tree, up and past the broken barrier and onto the road. She
       makes a tight U-Turn, sticks the car into four wheel drive
       and plows down the rough gravely road.

117                                                               117
       EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING

       She passes the Plymouth on her way. Sees its wheels lodged
       deep in the mud. Keeps going.

118                                                               118
       EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING

       She drives right on through the ghostly housing estate,
       slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves.
       Empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind.

       The lights of the mall grow closer.

119                                                               119
       INT. FORD EXPLORER- EVENING

       She passes that stop sign, sighs. The barrier is open and the
       road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. She slowly inches
       out on to the road and commits to her return to
       "civilization".

120                                                               120
       EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING

       The road's empty.

121                                                               121
       INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

       She punches the accelerator, drives just over the speed
       limit.

122                                                               122
       EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING

       The concrete blocks of the mall rise from the wastelands
       ahead on her left.

       She slows, ahead there's a small traffic jam at the entrance
       to the Mall road.

                                      Scene 123Page 92
       


123                                                                123
       INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

       She hears the siren before she sees the police car.

       God, she hopes they don't notice her smashed up windscreen,
       the fucked up side of the Ford.

124                                                                124
       EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING

       She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the
       police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall
       road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance
       road blocked off.

125                                                                125
       INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

       Of course.    How long has it been? That poor security guard.

       She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left
       the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime.

       Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they
       come for her? She's got to get back to the kids.

       Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face
       looks back.

                             DELLA
                    Oh my.

       She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood.
       And her clothes!

       While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she
       fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex.

       She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror,
       some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only
       slightly better.

       The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police
       cars, steals a cursory glance.

       She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon
       start to disperse in different directions. The Mall
       disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty
       road.

       She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How
       could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like
       this.

                                               Scene 125Page 93
       


       She hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to
       sixty. Runs a light.

126                                                                126
       EXT. RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING

       As long as the roads empty she's gonna own it.

127                                                                127
       INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

       At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows
       down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on
       the adjoining road.

       With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from
       her purse.

       She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so
       parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it
       away.

128                                                                128
       EXT. CROSSROADS - EVENING

       She drives through the crossroads.

129                                                                129
       INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING

       She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some
       color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away
       with the back of her hand.

       Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She
       decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes
       the driver stares at her car.

       She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She
       passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The
       road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five.

       The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She
       tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy.

       The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And
       a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to
       slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The
       driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts
       to smile and look like a normal housewife.

130                                                                130
       EXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING

       She waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator
       again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates
       of Pleasant valley Dream Homes.

                                               Scene 130Page 94
       

       She rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find
       it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses
       again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant
       Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few
       minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through
       the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But
       she's in.

       She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she
       approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks
       herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard.

       When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She
       snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed
       emotion that it feels like it's made of stone.

       She pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat.

       She glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat.

       She turns off the ignition.

       She looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the
       ignition.

       She glances at the gun.

       She looks at the house; it all looks normal.

       She takes a deep breath.

       She moves to get out of the car.

       She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She
       finds her chub card inside. She sighs.

131                                                                131
       EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING

       She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the
       car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed
       behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of
       the tree still lying there in the snow.

       The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the
       windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to
       the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the
       front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in
       the front door lock. Pushes open the door.

132                                                                132
       INT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

                            KENNETH
                  Where the hell have you been?

                                       Scene 132Page 95
       


       Kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice
       welcome.

       She doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into
       the house.

       There he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in
       one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 I said....

       He's about to begin shouting again when he notices
       something's not right about her.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Della?

       He switches the TV volume down using the remote.

                           KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Della honey are you all right?

       She stares back at him coldly.

                           DELLA
                 Please don't call me that. Don't
                 ever call me that again.

                              KENNETH
                 What?

       She steps slowly towards him. Sees a violent adventure flick
       wrapping up behind him on TV. The end credits scroll down the
       screen.

                           DELLA
                 I just wanted to get home to my
                 babies.

       Kenneth cannot understand her garbled words. He sees the
       dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat.

                           KENNETH
                 What happened to you?

       She just stares.

                           KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Was there an accident?

                                      Scene 132Page 96
       


       She keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression.
       She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move
       towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what
       to do, so he takes a swig of beer.

                           KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Are you hurt?

       That swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to
       stone.

       A beat.

                           DELLA
                 Are they okay?

       Without waiting for an answer.

133                                                                133
       INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING

       She turns and races up the stairs.

134                                                                134
       INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING

       She opens the door softly. The night light casts a pale glow
       out low across the carpet. There they are, all tucked up in
       their quilts, breathing gently, little faces flushed with
       sleep.

       She sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the
       door behind her.

135                                                                135

       Walks back downstairs.

       INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

       Kenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer.

                           KENNETH
                 Sound asleep, huh?

       Kenneth, unsure what to do, tries to make a joke.

                           KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 So. What'd you bring me from the
                 mall?

       Della sighs, calmly pulls out the gun from her pocket, looks
       him right in the eye, points the barrel at his face.

       He shrinks back, silent for once, blind panic playing across
       his face.

       But not hers. She's cold, cold as the icy night.

       She pulls the trigger at point blank range. CLICK

       He recoils.

       But no bullet disengages from the barrel. Nothing. She knew
       there were no bullets left.

       But the click echoes throughout the silent house.

                             DELLA
                  Nothing.



                              THE END
THE WHISTLEBLOWER

1   BLACKNESS...                                                    1

                         GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN)
               I can't see anything... Are you there?

    Silence.

                         GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D)
               Are you there!?

    Giggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a
    cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame.

                         LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
               God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door?

    She scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating...

                         RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
               Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try.

    RAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching...
    CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto...

2   EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       2

    A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING
    BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes
    skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a
    MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof.

    Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a
    cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It
    FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.

                         RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
               It's ammonia, not alcohol.

                         BOY (UKRAINIAN)
               (Drunk) You're so smart. I love you!

    He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba
    gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into...

    TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in...

    A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance,
    silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs
    to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want
    to think about what life holds in store.

    Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of
    the time. Yelling over to Luba...
                                                           TWB 2.


                        RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
              I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me.

                        LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
              No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman
              wants us there at 9 in the morning.

    Raya looks at Luba. Torn.

                        LUBA (CONT'D)
              It's just a few months working in a
              hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like
              your mother? Marry one of these assholes?
              There's nothing here!.. He said it was
              both of us or no go!

    Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates;
    she needs this so badly.

                        LUBA (CONT'D)
              Fuck your mom!

    But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past
    Luba who watches her disappear.

3   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT                       3

    Raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights
    come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn
    between anger and relief.

                        RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
              I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but--

                        HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
              It's three in the morning.

    Halyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the
    lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom.
    SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's
    measly aspirations...

4   EXT. KYIV - MORNING                                             4

    The silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv.

5   INT. APARTMENT - KYIV - MORNING                                 5

    Raya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a
    cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod.

                           ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)
              Big smile!
                                                             TWB 3.


    Luba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up.

                        LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
              (practicing) I am Natalya Verbova. I am
              going to Budapest to buy carpets for re-
              selling. I am staying two days...

    Raya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia,
    nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera.

                        LUBA (CONT'D)
              No-one's gonna believe we really did it!

    Luba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement.

    CAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up
    with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE.
    Then the title of the film fades in...

                         "THE WHISTLEBLOWER"

    A FLASHLIGHT cuts across...

6   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT                   6

    POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to

    THE FRONT PORCH

    He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38.
    Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell
    of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE
    standing in the doorway.

                        HUSBAND
              It just got a bit heated, you know how it
              gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors
              tomorrow.

    Kathy nods, humoring. A police radio BUZZES.

                        OFFICER LEEDS
              Ready to go?

    Kathy eyes the wife, tries to see past them into the house.

                        KATHY
              You sure everything is alright, Ma'am?

    The wife is still. Kathy eyes her, gently. Then, calm...

                        WIFE
              Really. It was nothing.
                                                              TWB 4.




    The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him,
    noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to
    a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.

                        KATHY
              You all have any children?

                        HUSBAND
              Nope.

    The wife looks down. The man stirs, agitated.

                        HUSBAND (CONT'D)
              So if that's all Officer...

                        KATHY
              I'd like to take a quick walk through the
              house.

                        HUSBAND
              You can't do that without a warrant.

                        KATHY
              Yes I can, Sir, please step aside.

    The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up
    the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...

                        HUSBAND
              You're not coming in my house!

    He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he...

    GRABS Kathy. HURLS her into a wall. CRACK. Kathy yells in
    EXTREME PAIN.

    O.S. POLICE SIRENS BLARE

7   INT. HOSPITAL HALL - NIGHT                                         7

    Three POLICE OFFICERS linger. They peek through a door at...

8   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                          8

    Kathy. She sits up on a gurney. The DOCTOR examines her
    shoulder. It's BRUISED PURPLE.

                        DOCTOR
              Painful there?

    Kathy winces.
                                                       TWB 5.


CAPTAIN HAWK, 50s, African American, walks in, noticing her
exposed shoulders, and turns, uncomfortable. Kathy covers.

                    HAWK
          I'm her Captain.

                    DOCTOR
          Her collar bone is broken. And I'm going
          to have to set her arm in a cast.

                    HAWK
          Lookin' for a route to the desk?

                    KATHY
          Yeah, I'm gonna break every bone in my
          body until I'm captain.

Hawk laughs.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          I'm fine. I'm sure you have a hotter date
          than this tonight.

                    HAWK
          I wish.

                    KATHY
          Just when my self esteem was gettin' so
          healthy.

                    HAWK
          We found a boy locked in the basement.
          Badly beaten. We charged the husband with
          domestic assault. You made the right
          call. But you should've waited for
          backup. (sighing)... I wish I didn't have
          to say this--

                    KATHY
          You're giving Deke the gold shield.

                    HAWK
          I have to Kathy. He has seniority.

Kathy shakes her head, deeply disappointed.

                    HAWK (CONT'D)
          You deserve the promotion. You should be
          a detective and if we had more openings--

                    KATHY
          That gold shield was the first one in
          four years... Sir... I'm going to have to
          resign, and take that position overseas.
                                                              TWB 6.


                        HAWK
              I think that's a mistake. I want you on
              my team.

    Kathy sighs, touched. But...

                        KATHY
              Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on
              the streets much longer. Not if I don't
              know there's something on the other end.

    She looks up at Hawk, but he's staring past her at...

    The door. Kathy turns, seeing... A young, scared GIRL, 15.
    This is ERIN. Kathy's daughter. She's heard everything. Hawk
    eyes Erin, sympathetic.

                        HAWK
              Just think about it, will you?

    He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes
    Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say.

9   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER                                         9

    Erin stares out the window. Kathy watches her, concerned.

                        ERIN
              I wish you could stay here.

                           KATHY
              Me too.

    Erin turns. Serious. Weighing...

                        ERIN
              I mean it's fine living at dad's, but...
              Now I really won't see you for a while.

                        KATHY
              I'm doing this for us. If I have a better
              job, I can give you guys more.

    Erin nods, tearing again.

                        ERIN
              When do you have to decide?

                           KATHY
              Come here.

    Erin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug,
    wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face.
                                                            TWB 7.


                         ERIN
               Are you sure it's not dangerous?

                         KATHY
               Of course. It's been four years. Things
               are getting back to normal over there.

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:

     A BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS
     everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN. Cyrillic letters:

     SARAJEVO - 3 KM.

     Sprayed across it in red: TURN AROUND!

10   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                        10

     A SILHOUETTE breaks the horizon and SPEEDS towards us,
     throwing up gravel: a dented white BUS, emblazoned with large
     black letters: "UN". A UNITED STATES flag on it.

     TITLE CARD: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA 1999

11   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         11

     Kathy sits in a bus full of BLUE BERETS. She looks out the
     window, her eyes drinking it all in...

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               You come here today as a beacon of hope,
               as representatives of humanity's highest
               aspirations.

     In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A
     SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH.

     Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen,
     20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace'
     sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY.

     In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one
     flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR.

     The bus cranks around the corner, entering...

12   EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                12

     The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war
     reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue
     is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged
     from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to
     the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin.
                                                             TWB 8.


     IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window...

                          CARMEN
               Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are
               at eye level. People just running to the
               store.

     All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome
     by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.

                                                   INTERCUT WITH:

     MOVE ALONG rapt faces... YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED MEN, heads
     held high, ready for anything. We're in...

13   INT. MEETING HALL - LATER                                      13

     BILL HYNES paces before the assembled NEW RECRUITS. He's in
     his 50s, distinguished and seemingly in charge...

                         BILL HYNES
               You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace
               International to represent the US as
               monitors for the United Nations, which
               means you are the only national
               contingent coming from a private
               military. So you people chose to come
               here. And for the next few weeks, we will
               teach you how to protect the rule of law
               in a war zone, how to rebuild a civil
               society brick by brick...

     MOVING OVER more RECRUITS... On their laps, "DYNCORP"
     ORIENTATION FOLDERS. MEN, listening, determined...

14   EXT. OUTLYING SUBURB - DAY                                     14

     Kathy and RECRUITS receive TRAINING from a PAKISTANI MONITOR,
     shadowing him as he hands food-packs to a LINE of REFUGEES.

                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               ...to ensure the dignity, equality, and
               inalienable human rights of every single
               person in this devastated place.

     The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of
     the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He
     hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what
     to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather
     away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I?

     ASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans.
                                                              TWB 9.


                         BILL HYNES (CONT'D)
               The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended
               this war, dictating that an International
               Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth
               the transition from war to peace.

15   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SARAJEVO - DAY                               15

     KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a
     mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER.
     CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field.

     A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader,
     TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out...

     A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A
     SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"

                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               But you will learn that peace is harder
               won than war..

     Kathy watches the boy run back up the road. The recruits head
     down STEEP STEPS into...

16   INT. ARTILLERY DEPOSIT - MOMENTS LATER                         16

     Light sneaks through cracks, catching on the oil black
     barrels of THOUSANDS of GUNS. Todd hands out BINDERS.

                         TODD MYERS
               We are still in the process of disarming
               the Muslim, Croat, and Serb militias. You
               will be cataloguing these arms for
               decommissioning records.

     Kathy eyes the unending stash of GUNS.

17   EXT. SARAJEVO SUBURBS - DUSK                                   17

     Kathy drives past a MILITARY BASE, an ITALIAN FLAG flying...
     A few hundred yards up the street, a BAR...

     BELLA LUNA BAR

     Driving past a another BAR. GERMAN FLAG... A SIGN: BERLIN
     NIGHTS... Kathy passes by, amused.

18   EXT. AMERICAN DORMS - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - EVENING               18

     Kathy and Carmen are led by a MONITOR through a sparsely
     furnished UNIT. A poster of `Born in the USA' on the wall.
                                                              TWB 10.


                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               You will learn that every morning's
               hope...

     Carmen bounces her butt up and down to test her mattress.

19   INT. LOCAL GROCERY STORE - DAY                                 19

     Kathy inspects items on the shelves. Nothing familiar.

     MOVING POV FROM BUS - EARLIER

     A cluster of WOMEN in BLACK BURKAS. They sway like reeds in
     the wind, grief overcoming them as they watch:

                         BILL HYNES (O.S.)
               ...is haunted by yesterday's nightmare...

     UN BLUE HELMETS supervise the dig of a mass grave. Bodies are
     revealed. A child's shoe is uncovered. A BURLY PEACEKEEPER
     turns, sickened.

20   EXT. TITO BARRACKS - AFTERNOON                                 20

     The bus arrives. The base is surrounded by barbed wire and
     overlook sights, manned by ARMED MILITARY.

     MEETING HALL: Hynes looks out at the new batch. Proud.

                         BILL HYNES
               But today is a new day. As Head of the
               United Nations Mission here I trust that
               we stake our highest values, even our
               lives, on the belief that we can rebuild,
               we must renew, we will witness the
               rebirth of this country.

     The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER
     THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back:

     Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde
     hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the
     room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.

21   INT. KITCHEN - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             21

     Kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread. Carmen
     across from her. Kathy takes a bite and grimaces.

                         KATHY
               I thought this was peanut butter but--
                                                           TWB 11.


                         CARMEN
               It's ass paste? I know. I bought it too.
               Let's get out of here. I need a drink.

22   EXT. STREET - SARAJEVO - NIGHT                               22

     ROCK MUSIC ECHOES from several bars. Carmen heads toward one,
     when an AMERICAN IPTF MONITOR stops her.

                         AMERICAN IPTF
               That's a military Bar. You want the party
               in there...

     He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki
     lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit.

     Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR
     and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo.

     There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN
     WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.

                         CARMEN
               Fuck me, we're outnumbered. Good odds.

                         KATHY
               Hon, they're all yours.

     They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the
     officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then
     zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is
     surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their
     shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.

                         CARMEN
               Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a
               Jaegermeister.

     Jan laughs at Carmen's forwardness, his eye on Kathy. But she
     spots Todd Myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...

                         JAN
               What about you? You don't have an order?

                         KATHY
               No. I'm the polite one.

                         JAN
               I like polite.

     Carmen turns his head toward her.
                                                         TWB 12.


                       CARMEN
             I'm gonna be the drunk one. Let's get
             toasted.

Kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. Carmen leans
into Kathy's ear. She smiles, and moves off.

AT THE BAR

Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye,
but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN
SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous.
And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...

                       ITALIAN SOLDIER
             I'd pay double for a woman in uniform.

Kathy looks him over.

                       KATHY
             Sorry pal, I'm not for sale.

The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh.

                       TODD MYERS (O.S.)
             We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale...
             Kathy, right?

Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF
AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly.

                       TODD MYERS (CONT'D)
             Look the basic lay of the land is we have
             to work with the other nationals, but we
             don't mix with them at night.

JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking...

                       JIM HIGGINS
             Lucky those wops don't carry guns or
             we'd've had ourselves a situation.
             Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping
             we'd get to squeeze some off.

                       TODD MYERS
             At who? Better odds you'll step on a land
             mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do
             for you then?

                        JIM HIGGINS
             (embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who
             buried it.

Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy.
                                                             TWB 13.


                         TODD MYERS
               You ever had to take someone down?

                            KATHY
               Just once.

     The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good.

23   INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT                                   23

     Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to
     leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still
     with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS.

     Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's
     watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk.

                          JAN
               You should probably get her home.

                          KATHY
               You probably shouldn't have let her drink
               that much.

     Kathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her.

                         JAN
               Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys.
               Nothing was going to happen to her.

     Kathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               I was hoping you'd come back.

                         KATHY
               Well I did. And now we're both leaving.

24   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                       24

     Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley.

25   INT. DORM - KITCHEN - MORNING                                 25

     Kathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing
     relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head.

                         CARMEN
               What the hell happened last night?

     Kathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They
     both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock.
                                                           TWB 14.


                         KATHY
               Let's move. We're gonna be late.

26   EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY                             26

     Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo
     suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings.
     Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And
     stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions
     Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...

                         CARMEN
               Do you have any idea where we are?

     Kathy shakes her head. No idea.

27   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            27

     A run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple
     of small offices off the open center.

     Kathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for
     them... Jan Van Der Velde.

                         JAN
               Late night ladies?

     They eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               I'm your duty officer. You check the duty
               roster. Every day. You're each assigned
               to monitor and instruct a group of
               Bosnian local police. We work in six week
               shifts. You instruct in the mornings,
               then go into the field with them in the
               afternoon. One of you needs to go now.

     He eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out
               the gate, then left, left, park, right...

     Kathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               My van. There's a map in front.

     She drops the keys, grabs them, and rushes out.

28   EXT. 5TH CANTON - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - MORNING                     28

     A SCHOOL sprayed with GRAFFITI and BULLETS.
                                                           TWB 15.


29   INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING                                       29

     An abandoned CLASSROOM. Shabby corkboards with yellowing PSA
     posters, ragged kids' drawings, and tired sticky tape.

     Kathy skims through the training binders. The DOOR OPENS and
     a GROUP OF LOCAL POLICE file in. They whisper, exchanging
     lascivious glances. Kathy straightens her uniform.

                         KATHY
               Feel free to sit wherever you like.

     Kathy waits for them to take their seats. They don't. A
     BOSNIAN WOMAN, pretty, rushes in. Spotting Kathy...

                         BOSNIAN WOMAN
               Sorry I am late. I'm your interpreter.

                         KATHY
               Great, well... I just asked them to sit.

     The interpreter shakes her head benignly. They take their
     seats. The interpreter looks at Kathy.

                         BOSNIAN WOMAN
               They like to be difficult. They
               understand if you're clear. Mostly they
               have trouble speaking English. But let's
               see if you can get them to talk at all.

     Kathy looks out, suddenly daunted. She presses on, opening
     her binder as authoritatively as she can.

                         KATHY
               Okay, I'm going to be talking about crime
               scene investigation today. If we could--

     An older officer, DANIK, stands, defiant.

                         DANIK (BROKEN ENGLISH)
               Where do we sign to say we came?

                         KATHY
               Actually, you sign the attendance at the
               end of the session. It's a UN mandate--

                         DANIK
               Or we sign now?

     Full of malice. Kathy puts the sheet away, then...

                         KATHY
               We sign later.
                                                              TWB 16.


     The cop scoffs, and sits.

30   INT. CLASSROOM - LATER                                         30

     Kathy stands in front of a BLACKBOARD with DRAWINGS on a
     CRIME SCENE. She crosses off TWO AREAS on the board.

                         KATHY
               ...Keeping the crime scene clean is
               number one.

     A weak smile. Nothing from the crowd. She trundles on.

             KATHY (CONT'D)                   INTERPRETER
     Remember you could be           Pamyatayte scho vu bu mholy
     stepping on the very evidence   stavatu na scho nam pokazaye
     that could incriminate. You     yaka bula nespodivanka. Treba
     have to track anything you      vcyo datu v torbu.
     bag. We call that 'chain of
     evidence.'

     Kathy looks out. The cops are barely paying attention. ONE
     stubs out a cigarette. Another closes the binder, defiantly.

                         DANIK
               We sign sheet now?

     Kathy leans back, disappointed. She hands him the sheet. They
     all sign, apathetic.

                         DANIK (CONT'D)
               You will tell UN we were cooperating?

     Kathy tries to retain a poker face but their indifference
     stings. And just as they're about to leave...

                         KATHY
               We have to go to the hospital together.

     The cops eye her, agitated.

31   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                            31

     Kathy's SUV pulls up behind the cluster of local police cars.
     IPTF OFFICER CLARKSON stands outside. He eyes his watch.
     Kathy rushes to him, but he's already a foot in the door.

                         KATHY
               We got here as quick as we could.

                         CLARKSON (BRITISH ACCENT)
               Just try to get them here on time.
                                                           TWB 17.


32   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                            32

     Clarkson leads Kathy and the BOSNIAN POLICE through the hall.
     Gurney's and IVs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't
     want to be examined here. Some windows are still covered with
     wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. The
     floors still hold the stains of old blood.

     Clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...

                         CLARKSON
               Seems we have two stabbings, one
               shooting, and a man with a broken leg and
               a bad hangover who can't remember what
               happened... Average night back in
               Brighton.

     The cops stare at him, lost. As they file into a SMALL ROOM
     filled with tightly drawn curtains. They all squeeze into the
     center together. Kathy is pressed against the large cop.

     Clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing...

     ZLATA SEHIK, 40, Muslim. Her face is covered with wounds. She
     avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. She
     pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as...

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               (reading chart) "facial contusions from
               repeated beatings with fist",
               "lacerations on the eye caused by the
               edge of an iron"...

     He pauses. Looking at Zlata, he moves her sheet up to expose
     her leg. Zlata's eyes tear. Clarkson reads...

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               "The right hand was the first entry point
               of a large kitchen knife"... "The second
               entry point in the upper left thigh"...
               It went through her hand and into her
               leg... Who's going to take this report?

     Kathy looks out at the Bosnian cops, but they stare at the
     ground. One cop peeks into the next cubicle. Kathy looks at
     Clarkson for a cue. He holds out the clipboard.

                           CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               Anyone?

     No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns
     to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She
     goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant.
                                                             TWB 18.


                         VIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH)
               I will take it.

     The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy,
     hungry for support. But Danik scoffs.

                         DANIK (BOSNIAK)
               (At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna.

     Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy
     looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing.

                         KATHY
               What did he say?

                         VIKO
               She is Muslim. He said she deserved it.

                         CLARKSON
               Alright, that's it. Everyone out.

                          KATHY
               (at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a
               complaint?

     The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf.

     Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye.
     Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at
     Zlata, who lies helpless.

33   INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                       33

     Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him.

                         KATHY
               She has to file a complaint. A woman gets
               stabbed in the face and there are no
               repercussions?

     Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares.

                         CLARKSON
               Quit it! You hear me?

     Kathy reddens. The local cops look over.

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               We are not investigators. We are
               monitors. You don't know a Serb from a
               Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic
               hatreds that started a war. This isn't
               just policing, it's diplomacy.
                                                              TWB 19.


     Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl.

                         CLARKSON (CONT'D)
               We don't run the show, we make sure the
               show runs smoothly.

34   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             34

     Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She
     flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out
     of her room, dolled up for the evening.

                         CARMEN
               Come out. You can't solve this tonight.
               I'm not taking no for an answer.

35   EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT                      35

     Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches
     the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR
     walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a
     short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking.

36   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                        36

     Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order.

37   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING                                  37

     Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy.

38   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            38

     Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top.

                         VIKO
               Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital
               eight time because of her husband. Every
               time she try to file a complaint, my
               bosses send her back. They always laugh
               at the woman... They laughed at my
               mother. They do not make prosecutions of
               domestic violence. I want to get enough
               evidence to do this.

     Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily...

                         VIKO (CONT'D)
               This is why you are here, no?

     Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes
     the files, flipping through them. Thinking...
                                                           TWB 20.


                         KATHY
               With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you
               go back to the hospital... You can pull
               the records for every one of her visits.

39   INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY                               39

     A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files.

40   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                           40

     Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through
     Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged.

                         KATHY
               Okay, now get the same thing from all the
               doctors who treated her. They will have
               to testify on Zlata's behalf.

41   INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING                                    41

     Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows
     Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face.

                         KATHY
               This is good. Let's cross reference each
               injury with other cases where felony
               assaults were ruled. Can you get
               something like that?

     Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar
               is illegal then the same standard can be
               applied to a domestic assault.

42   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                         42

     Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules.

                         KATHY (O.S.)
               If an attorney presents this properly,
               referencing international standards, you
               might be able to get a conviction.

     Viko and Zlata wait... then breathe relief. They won. Viko
     turns TO THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM: Kathy smiles, at last
     feeling they can really accomplish something.

43   INT. JAN'S OFFICE - ILIDZA STATION - DAY                      43

     Kathy comes inside, interrupting Jan and FRANZ, Dutch IPTF.
                                                              TWB 21.


                         KATHY
               Sorry, you wanted to see me?

     Franz excuses himself, eyeing a tense Kathy. Jan closes the
     door behind Franz, turning to Kathy. All business.

                         JAN
               Madeleine Rees wants to see you. Head of
               the Office of the United Nations High
               Commissioner for Human Rights.

                            KATHY
               What? Why?

                         JAN
               I'm sure it's fine. You followed
               protocol, right?

     Kathy rushes out, worried. Jan smiles, in on a secret.

44   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - SARAJEVO - MORNING               44

     Kathy sits alone in the office. Degrees, plaques, and awards
     cover the walls. Pictures of Madeleine Rees with Kofi Annan,
     Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela... Kathy is intimidated.

     MADELEINE REES, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair,
     British. She sashays in with a DOBERMAN on a leash.

                         MADELEINE REES
               Don't mind Helen, she's a total sap.

     Kathy eyes the malevolent hound.

                         KATHY
               Ms. Rees, I--

                         MADELEINE REES
               Madeleine. You've been stirring things
               up.

                         KATHY
               Is this about Zlata Sehik? If I've
               overstepped protocol--

                         MADELEINE REES
               You have done in two months, what we've
               been trying to do for years.

     Madeleine sits. Kathy straightens.
                                                           TWB 22.


                         MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
               All due respect to Viko Mezovic, but you
               just facilitated the first conviction for
               domestic abuse in Bosnian history. I'm
               bloody impressed. So is the Dutch Duty
               Officer who recommended you.

     Kathy takes it in. Madeleine looks out the window at TWO
     GLASS TOWERS that punctuate Sarajevo's skyline.

                         MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
               The IPTF has a Gender Affairs Office at
               Mission Headquarters. Dervla Hughes, the
               current head, is leaving and I think
               you're the right person to take over.

     Kathy is taken aback.

                         MADELEINE REES (CONT'D)
               You'd be overseeing 12 regional offices.
               Any gender reports come through you. This
               involves anything from equality training
               to domestic and child abuse cases,
               fallout from war crimes against women,
               prostitution. Women in Bosnia are treated
               like second class citizens. You could
               have a real impact on their lives. What
               do you think? Are you interested?

     This is everything Kathy came to do...

                         KATHY
               Absolutely.

45   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - NIGHT                            45

     Kathy paces, phone to her ear. Her suitcase open, she's
     packing at the same time. Carmen helps.

                         KATHY (INTO PHONE)
               I know hon, it's very exciting. If this
               works out. It's a real opportunity for
               the future, but it means I have to, I
               have to extend my contract for another
               six months... Hello?..

     Kathy stops pacing.

                           KATHY (CONT'D)
               ...Erin?

     Kathy pulls the phone close, listening. Carmen eyes her.
                                                           TWB 23.


                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               No I didn't. I'll look right now.

     Kathy goes over to a computer, clicking open an EMAIL. ON THE
     SCREEN: A PICTURE OF ERIN in a PROM DRESS. Kathy sits back,
     flushed with emotion. Her enthusiasm complicated by the
     realization of what she's missing back home. Softly...

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               You look beautiful...

46   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT                        46

     Carmen helps Kathy load boxes and suitcases into an SUV.

                         CARMEN
               I can't believe they're moving you into
               the city. I'm so jealous. So where's your
               office?

                         KATHY
               Mission Headquarters... UNMHQ.

                         CARMEN
               But Madeleine is UNHCHR, right?

                         KATHY
               (smiling) I know. I don't even know if
               I'm still IPTF.

                         CARMEN
               Well I don't give an F.U.C.K. All I know
               is I'm gonna miss you. Stay in touch with
               the little people!

     They hug. Kathy smiles, and hops into the car.

47   EXT. SARAJEVO ROAD - NIGHT                                     47

     Kathy drives into the CITY CENTRE.

48   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 48

     Kathy puts the last box down. She steps out onto the balcony.
     Looks out at Sarajevo, city of survivors, her new home.

49   EXT. UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS (UNMHQ) - SARAJEVO - MORNING      49

     Member nations' flags slap in the wind. Hundreds of UN SUVs.
     Kathy drives up. She takes in the huge building. Almost in
     disbelief that she's part of it, at the center of it all.
                                                           TWB 24.


50   INT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - MORNING                                   50

     The modern lobby buzzes with UN OFFICIALS and DIPLOMATS.
     Kathy follows RICK JONES, 30s, athletic, crisp.

                         RICK JONES
               I'm glad to have an American in the mix.
               You'll be reporting to me.

                         KATHY
               Oh... I, I thought I was reporting to
               Madeleine Rees' Office.

                         RICK JONES
               It's a joint office. She's Human Rights.
               But you're Police Task Force. So you go
               through me. But we all report to Bill
               Hynes anyhow.

     They walk through two large doors into... The Inner Sanctum.

51   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - CONTINUOUS                             51

     Rick and Kathy round a corner to a medium-sized office, boxes
     everywhere. Rick eyes the... mess.

                         RICK JONES
               Yeah, your ah... predecessor's files...
               We're waiting for Archives to get those
               out of here. I'll put another call in.

     Kathy nods, taking in the disarray. Dust sits on the stacks
     of boxes, on papers and files strewn about.

                         KATHY
               It's fine. Thanks for the tour.

                         RICK JONES
               Great. I'll leave you to it. Good luck.

     He leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality
     of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's
     raring to go. She eyes a name plate:

     KATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS.

     Kathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall.

     THE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in
     the flickering fluorescent light.
                                                            TWB 25.


52   EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT               52

     Black cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open-
     doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan
     walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained.

                         JAN
               I was wondering when you'd ask me out.

                         KATHY
               It's not a date... No, seriously. It's
               not. I know you had a lot to do with my
               promotion, so I wanted to thank you.

     He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A
     NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant.

53   EXT. CAFE - OLD TOWN - LATER                                   53

     Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a
     carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish).

                         JAN
               Here's to not dating.

                         KATHY
               Listen to me. I'm not joking around.
               You're a nice guy. But I...

     The waitress reaches across Kathy with a plate. Winks at Jan.

                         WAITRESS
               You are certain you have everything you
               need?

     The waitress eyes him coyly. Kathy studies the exchange.

                         JAN
               We're fine thank you.

     The waitress leaves. Kathy shakes her head, amused.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               You were saying I'm a nice guy--

     Kathy is watching the waitress hit up another table.

                         KATHY
               You must be in heaven over here.

                         JAN
               The war left behind a lot of widows.
                                                           TWB 26.


                         KATHY
               You don't find that--

                         JAN
               I find it uncomfortable. A lot of guys
               don't. I don't know what else to say
               about it. Now finish your sentence, I'm a
               nice guy but--

                         KATHY
               I can't afford to mess this up.

                         JAN
               It's only dinner. How bad can it get?

                         KATHY
               Ask my two ex-husbands.

     He grins. Kathy looks at him, unsettled by the chemistry
     between them.

54   INT. CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - DAY                                   54

     Rick introduces Kathy to various IPTF and UN colleagues.

55   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                             55

     Kathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way. She organizes a
     BIG BULLETIN BOARD into 12 CANTONS.

56   EXT. EIGHTH CANTON - AFTERNOON                                56

     Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the
     front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look
     up, their hands over their mouths, keening.

                         BARRY
               This is the first time they've seen their
               homes in years.

     IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and
     belongings. THREE carry a couch up the steps of a building as
     a YOUNG BROTHER and SISTER watch. Standing back, an ELDERLY
     WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on
     makeshift storm windows on her aparment.

     Kathy watches, Barry by her side.

                         KATHY
               They're all widows?

                          BARRY
               That's why they were so frightened to
               come back.
                          (MORE)
                                                           TWB 27.

                         BARRY (CONT'D)
               They couldn't believe they'd be safe.
               That what happened before wouldn't happen
               again. Except now with nobody to protect
               them.

     Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their
     past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands
     numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her
     face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.

                            KATHY
               Except us.

                         BARRY
               I always thought helping refugees get
               home would be one of the best parts of
               the job. But it's so hard for them.

     Kathy nods, moved.

                         KATHY
               Thanks for taking me through this. Fill
               me in when you're done, and I'll send my
               report to Rick Jones.

     Another FIELD OFFICER rushes up. An urgent look on his face.

57   INT. IPTF FIELD OFFICE - AFTERNOON                             57

     The field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to...

     A YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody
     and swollen. Kathy runs up to the girl, who can barely sit
     up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her
     surroundings, and...

     JUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR.

     Kathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns
     back to the girl, and slowly places a hand on her shoulder.
     The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head.

                         KATHY
               It's okay, it's--

     But the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks
     around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an
     exit. She eyes them all, realizing she's surrounded and
     then... SHE WAILS.

     Losing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her,
     trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs.
     Hopelessness in her eyes. And then...
                                                      TWB 28.


She faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          (at field worker) Call a medic!

He rushes off. Kathy and Barry lay the girl down. She lies on
the ground, breathing slowly, looking close to death.

Kathy holds her hand.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          Who is she?

                    FIELD WORKER
          I found her out in the woods. She was
          speaking, I don't know, she's not local.
          I think she's one of the girls from the
          bars.

Looking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her
face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is...

Raya. A long way from home. But then...

THE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA,
17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face
bruised. Kathy looks up...

                    HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER
          She was further back in the woods.

Irka sees Raya. Sudden relief. Then realizing...

                    IRKA (ENGLISH/RUSSIAN)
          Florida Bar... Ciysh... Six girl there...
          Iy Policai...

Kathy looks to Barry.

                    BARRY
          It's a bar in the hills.

Kathy shakes her head. She looks at Raya and Irka.

                    BARRY (CONT'D)
          I'll take them to the women's shelter at
          Zenica.

Kathy rummages through her files, catching up.

                    KATHY
          Yeah. Good. I'll follow up at the bar.

Barry shrugs. Kathy's mind is racing.
                                                           TWB 29.


                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               Where exactly is this bar?

58   INT./ EXT. - UN SUV - DAY                                      58

     Kathy drives up a winding mountain road, checking directions
     on a hand-drawn map. A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the
     opposite direction.

59   INT. UN SUV/EXT. FLORIDA BAR - DAY                             59

     Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees

     THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a
     garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side.

     Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards...

     LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS.

     A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They
     blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost...

     At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between
     Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless.

     Kathy rushes towards the cop. He eyes her, dubious.

                         KATHY
               What's going on here?

                         LOCAL COP (SERBIAN)
               Xo brovnic ce klety scey forzcic nay.

     He moves past her, with the Girls in tow.

                          KATHY
               Hold on. Where are the IPTF monitoring
               this raid?

     SHOUTING ECHOES from inside the bar. TWO COPS drag out TANJO
     ZRAVBIC, 50s. He sees Kathy's uniform and SHOUTS at her.

                         TANJO (SERBIAN)
               Zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny
               Traba! Motherfockers!

     The cops SHOVE Tanjo in a car, and SLAM the door. Kathy turns
     to the Local Cop, standing with the group of girls.

                         KATHY
               Is that the owner? Are you taking him
               into custody?
                                                      TWB 30.


                    LOCAL COP
          Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky.

Kathy looks around, frustrated.

                    KATHY
          Is there a translator on the scene?
          Translator?... Wait.

He stops, impatient. Kathy pulls out her WALKIE.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          This is Kathy Bolkovac. I need an
          Interpreter. At the Florida Bar.

The Local Cops watch her. Kathy's eyes rest on the girls.

                    WALKIE VOICE (O.S.) (ACCENTED ENGLISH)
          Okay. I need a time and date.

                      KATHY
          Now.

                    WALKIE VOICE (O.S.)
          That's impossible. We need advance notice
          for field calls.

The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him,
but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward
them, protectively, then sees...

TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar.

TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them.
They seem surprised.

                    KATHY
          Hey. I'm from Gender Affairs. I--

                    FRED MURRAY
          Hey. Fred Murray.

He shakes her hand.

Tanjo BANGS on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic
with rage. Kathy glances over her shoulder.

                    KATHY
          Is that the owner? (off Fred's nod) I
          tried to get an interpreter but--

                    FRED MURRAY
          No, no... that's fine. We're pretty much
          done here anyway.
                                                           TWB 31.


                         KATHY
               Oh... Okay. But there's... We just had
               two girls come in to a Human Rights
               Office, saying they escaped from this
               place.

     Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.

                         FRED MURRAY
               Yeah. Local police have been watching the
               place for a while. This whole thing
               happened pretty fast. I guess those girls
               must've run for it.

     Kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.

                         KATHY
               Well, the girls in our field office
               seemed pretty scared. I should follow up
               with these ones.

     The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes,
     getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.

                         FRED MURRAY
               You can see where they're taking them,
               but I can't intervene. You know the
               drill.

     He shrugs and smiles. Kathy hears the POLICE VAN's engine
     start. Turning to it...

                         KATHY
               Thanks. I'll look out for your report.

     She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van
     driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off.

     Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.

60   INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER                             60

     Kathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small
     stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it.
     CUT WIRES hang over the stage.

     THE BAR AREA

     Is filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men,
     IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene.

                          KATHY
               Jesus...
                                                              TWB 32.


     Kathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the
     two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud.

     Kathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over.
     Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER!

     She turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of
     electricity. Tiny sparks fly.

     She turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A
     handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And...

     PASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls.
     She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file.

     Her eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled
     door. And pushes. It opens onto...

     STEPS: She shines her flashlight up the dark passage...

     The BEAM of the flashlight finds a DOOR. A glint off metal...
     At the door handle, a large PADLOCK, smashed open. Kathy
     darts the beam over the other TWO DOORS... both equipped with
     PADLOCKS. Smashed.

     Kathy pushes through the first door into...

61   INT. HIDDEN BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             61

     Kathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room
     into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor.

     Her eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away.
     And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each
     name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20...
     Some kind of RECORD.

     Kathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS.
     And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual
     positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200...

     The amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor.

     Kathy looks around, sickened.

62   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT         62

     A run-down Community Center nestled in a shabby area outside
     the city. It's completely unassuming. From the outside, you
     might think it was abandoned.
                                                             TWB 33.


63   INT. HALLWAY - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - MOMENTS LATER         63

     The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long-
     forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy
     linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that
     Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s,
     Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.

                         MILENA (ACCENTED ENGLISH)
               These girls are told they have been
               bought and must repay the debt. They are
               told an outrageous sum, thinking they'll
               be let go when they earn back that money.
               But they never are.

     Kathy stares at her, taken aback.

                         MILENA (CONT'D)
               Sex trafficking is one of the worst
               things to happen after this war.

     Milena hands over a medical report.

                         MILENA (CONT'D)
               Raya has a severe internal infection. The
               doctor found (reading) "intentionally
               placed foreign objects causing a
               disruption of the vaginal wall".

                         KATHY
               Foreign objects?

                         MILENA
               Coins. She's not the first. Men can feel
               deficient paying for sex, so they find
               other ways to feel powerful.

     Milena pushes through a door. To a DARK HALLWAY...

     Hanging bulbs flicker intermittently. They walk. Avoiding
     dripping leaks in the roof.

                         MILENA (CONT'D)
               We gave her Penicillin, but the doctor is
               worried there could be something more
               serious.

                         KATHY
               When will he know?

     They pass an EATING AREA. TEEN GIRLS sit, pick at food, chain-
     smoke and flip through magazines. They are clean, but weak.
                                                         TWB 34.


                    MILENA
          Unfortunately that's all we can do for
          her. We're just a volunteer organization.

Kathy stares at the girls, the sheer number of them...

                    KATHY
          But if there are so many victims.

                    MILENA
          We lost our funding because of those.

...She points at a basket of CONDOMS near the coffee.

                    MILENA (CONT'D)
          It's the U.S. Department of State. They
          have their rules. I'll do anything to
          give these girls some protection. But the
          Department of State thinks "Condoms
          encourage prostitution." NGOs caught
          giving them out, no longer receive US
          funding.

                    KATHY
          But these girls aren't prostitutes.

Milena shrugs.

                    MILENA
          They don't realize the cycle they start. If
          there are no condoms in the bars...

They pass a ROOM DIVIDER. Seeing... MORE GIRLS. IN THEIR
TEENS. All broken. And desperate.

                     MILENA (CONT'D)
          ...the guys want to find ways of avoiding
          STDs. AIDS. Their solution? Pay more for
          virgins...

Kathy sees A GIRL sit in a corner. She couldn't be more than
TEN YEARS OLD. She sits alone.

                    MILENA (CONT'D)
          So the traffickers bring more in. Younger
          and younger. Now it's a global industry.
          Simple economics. If there is demand, you
          supply.

Milena opens a DOOR, revealing... INSIDE THE ROOM: A
VOLUNTEER NURSE sits by Raya's bed. She lies asleep. IN
ANOTHER BED: Irka sleeps. Kathy watches. Hushed...
                                                           TWB 35.


                         KATHY
               Where can they get help?

                         MILENA
               Try the Global Displacement Agency. They
               have good medical care, lots of funding.
               They might take them. Whether they'll
               keep them or not... I don't know.

                         KATHY
               Where are the other girls from the
               Florida bar?

     Milena looks at her. Blank.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               The local police were bringing them here.

                         MILENA
               Those girls never arrived.

64   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                        64

     UNMHQ stands over the crumbling red roofs of Sarajevo. In the
     foreground, a CEMETERY packed with crooked wooden crosses.

65   INT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - UNMHQ - MOMENTS LATER             65

     Kathy walks in. Carmen sits behind a desk, piled with files.

                         CARMEN
               Hey, where've you been?

                          KATHY
               I'll tell you about it over a drink.
               Could you just check something for me? I
               want to get a copy of the monitor's
               report from a raid on the Florida Bar
               yesterday.

     Carmen nods, and clicks on her computer.

                         CARMEN
               Your job is so exciting. The only thing I
               get to raid is the fridge. (Reading off
               the computer)... You sure there was a
               raid? There's no record here.

                         KATHY
               No. That's definitely it. There were six
               girls removed from the bar and I need to
               know where they were taken.
                                                           TWB 36.


                         CARMEN
               Sorry. No record of any raid.

     Kathy thinking. Something's not adding up.

66   INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         66

     Kathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an
     OFFICE, and knocks.

                         KATHY
               I'm looking for Fred Murray?

67   EXT. MINE FIELD - BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                    67

     FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand-
     held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device
     BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle.
     Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait...

     Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles.

                         FRED MURRAY
               We meet again!

     Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation.

                         KATHY
               Is it okay for me to be here?

                         FRED MURRAY
               Sure, sure. You're fine here on the
               gravel. What's going on?

                         KATHY
               I just wanted to follow up with you on
               the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't
               show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to
               locate them.

                         FRED MURRAY
               Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a
               mess. Turned out it was a local police
               mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or
               something. Thought they had a
               prostitution bust, but the bar is legit
               and those girls were just waitresses.

                         KATHY
               Waitresses aren't kept under lock and
               key.

     ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field.
                                                           TWB 37.


                         FRED MURRAY
               Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to
               get in there.

     Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She
     watches him go.

68   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY                              68

     Kathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV.

69   EXT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - DAY                          69

     A stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice.
     Kathy's SUV pulls up front.

70   INT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - MOMENTS LATER                70

     Kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is
     modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over
     the reception desk:

     GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY.

     The LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with
     a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A
     caption: "TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999"

     Kathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996...

     LAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes
     around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away.

                         KATHY
               Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will
               take them to the medical center. As soon
               as they get medical clearance we'll know
               where we stand.

                         KATHY
               What do you mean?

                         LAURA LEVIN
               Well, it's yet to be determined if
               they'll cooperate with the repatriation
               program. That's the only way I can allow
               them to stay at the GDA.
                                                             TWB 38.


                         KATHY
               They're critical... witnesses for a
               situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to
               speak with them when they're ready.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               I understand. I'll be in touch.

                         KATHY
               Will you be contacting their parents?

     Laura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind...

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               The other girls from the raid were
               supposed to go to the Women's Medica
               Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you
               have any idea where else they might have
               been taken?

                         LAURA LEVIN
               I didn't know there were any others.

     Kathy eyes the girls down the hall. Raya turns, a last look.

71   INT./EXT. UN SUV/GDA - NIGHT                                   71

     Kathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then,
     cranks the wheel right.

72   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                              72

     Kathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road.

73   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA - LATER                        73

     Laura in her office. HIGH MODERNITY. She works through her
     files. Opening one with Raya's photo on top. She dials.

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

74   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  74

     The phone is ringing. Halyna rushes to it. Out of breath...

                         HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
               Hello?

                         LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN)
               Mrs. Kochan, I'm calling from the Global
               Displacement Agency in Sarajevo to
               confirm you have a daughter named Rayisa?
                                                              TWB 39.


                         HALYNA (RUSSIAN)
               (Straightening) Yes. Yes!

                         LAURA LEVIN
               We have located her...

     Halyna falls into a chair, her chest heaving relief.

75   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                       75

     Kathy pulls up to a PARKING LOT full of CARS and UN SUVs.
     MUSIC spills out. BACK IN BUSINESS. She gets out of the SUV,
     moving inside...

76   INT. FLORIDA BAR - CONTINUOUS                                  76

     Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps
     along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A
     scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but
     her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS
     Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers.

     Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off-
     duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian
     casuals. A few LOCALS at the bar, where...

     Tanjo commands the scene, cheery, chatting with an IPTF
     OFFICER at the bar.

     Kathy stands, frozen , until she catches the eye of...

     Luba, sitting on the knee of a MIDDLE-AGED IPTF Officer.
     Kathy is filled with... anger.

77   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER                            77

     Kathy SPEEDS up the mountain roads. Past many bars. One after
     another, after another... All filled with UN SUVs. Groups of
     drunk OFFICERS spill out. She stops across from one, seeing:

     Jan coming out of the bar. Kathy watches, stunned...

     Jan helps a drunk friend pile into an SUV. He looks up and
     sees Kathy as a car beam slides over her. She pulls away.

78   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 78

     Kathy stands on the balcony. Taking in the cold air. A KNOCK.

                         JAN (O.S.)
               Kathy, it's Jan.

                          KATHY
               Go home.
                                                           TWB 40.


                         JAN (O.S.)
               I don't understand. What's wrong?

     Kathy stands, quiet.

                         JAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Let me in. Please.

     Kathy waits a moment, breathing...

79   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                      79

     Kathy paces as Jan struggles for words.

                         KATHY
               How can you go up there, when you know
               what happens to these girls?

                         JAN
               It was a good-bye party. I was--

                         KATHY
               They're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen--

                         JAN
               I know. If you let me finish, I got a
               call. Some friends needed a lift home
               because they got drunk. But hey lady, you
               better wake up! EVERYWHERE is a brothel.
               The coffee shop down the street. The post
               office. My corner store. That's how it is
               here. I'm not interested, and I try and
               stay in clean places. And if you don't
               believe me, then fuck you.

     He looks at her, hurt - He cares what she thinks. Kathy sees
     this. Something she hasn't felt in so long... Needed.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               Are you okay?

                         KATHY
               No... I'm not okay. These girls... What
               are these guys thinking?

     She looks at him, fighting the urge to trust him. Jan brushes
     a strand of hair from her face. She lets go. He pulls her in.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               Can you tell me what you know?
                                                             TWB 41.


80   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT                            80

     Jan and Kathy in front of her computer. They're on an IPTF
     MESSAGE BOARD: Flashes of Various Posts: New Girl at the
     Berlin Bar; New Twelve Year-Old Pussy at the Old Grill.

     They scroll down dozens of posts. Kathy looks at Jan, shaken
     by the banal malevolence of a boys club gone wild.

81   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                  81

     Kathy watches Jan, asleep in her bed.

82   EXT. CENTRAL SARAJEVO - MORNING                                82

     Fog hangs low over the waking valley of Sarajevo.

83   INT. GDA - MORNING                                             83

     A DOCTOR signs off on a final examination of a now much
     healthier looking Raya. He smiles. She signs a form.

84   INT. LAURA'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - DAY                         84

     Laura hovers in the background as Raya dials the phone. Her
     face raw with emotion.

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

85   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - SAME                            85

     The phone in the hall rings. But no one is there to answer.

86   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                   86

     Halyna at the door. Zenia pales. O.S. A kettle whistles.

                         ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
               Roman will be home soon.

                         HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
               Make your tea. I'll be quick.

     KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Zenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle. Her hands shake.
     Halyna stares at a new dishwasher. Then a microwave, blender
     and small LCD TV. Suspiciously out of context in Kyiv.

                         HALYNA (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D)
               Roman seems to be doing well.

                          ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
               Milk?
                                                           TWB 42.


                         HALYNA
               I need to borrow money.

     Zenia looks up, unsure.

                         HALYNA (CONT'D)
               They found Raya in Sarajevo. I want to go
               and get her. I don't need much.

     Zenia nods, keeping still as possible.

                         HALYNA (CONT'D)
               Does he still hit you?

     Zenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt.
     She wants so badly to say... but she can't.

                         HALYNA (CONT'D)
               You know I hate to ask. But she's my
               daughter... and your niece. Please--

                         ZENIA
               I'll get you the money... But you have to
               go. Roman will be home soon. He won't
               give it to me if he knows it's for you.

87   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - MORNING                             87

     Kathy watches Rick flip through her report.

                          KATHY
               Fred Murray. There were other officers
               too. But the raid was not in the books.
               These girls were just sent back. They are
               clearly not waitresses. They are victims.
               I think IPTF were paid off to turn a
               blind eye.

                         RICK JONES
               That's a serious allegation. And you
               don't have any evidence. I can't open an
               investigation based on a hunch.

     He drops the papers.

                         RICK JONES (CONT'D)
               You're gonna need more than this.

88   INT. GDA BOSNIA - AFTERNOON                                   88

     Raya and Irka sit across from Laura Levin. She slides a
     document over to each of them.
                                                      TWB 43.


                    LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN)
          If you sign here, you confirm that you
          are voluntarily entering the repatriation
          program at the GDA.

Raya eyes Irka, confused. Laura softens slightly...

                    LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)
          This means we can get you out of Bosnia.
          Isn't that what you want?

Raya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never
thought this moment would come...

                    LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D)
          You'll stay here for two weeks, to
          continue medical treatment as well as
          psychological counselling. We'll give you
          a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to
          get started when you return.

Suddenly Irka's face drops.

                    IRKA (RUSSIAN)
          But... What do I do then? My parents were
          killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who
          sold me here... Can't I go somewhere
          else?

Laura fumbles.

                    LAURA LEVIN
          We can only send you home, but what you
          choose to do after that is up to you.

But now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn.

                    RAYA (RUSSIAN)
          What about the others, the girls in the
          bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she
          couldn't... I don't know where she is...
          I can't go without her. Please...

Laura pauses, taken aback.

                    LAURA LEVIN
          I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you
          home. Otherwise you stay in Bosnia, where
          you... could face charges for illegal
          prostitution.

Raya stares, reeling... To be made to feel like a criminal?
                                                              TWB 44.


                         IRKA
               I will sign.

     Raya looks at her, but Irka doesn't look back.

89   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SHORT TIME LATER                 89

     Kathy stares out across the central courtyard. Into the
     adjoining building. Through the glass, she watches...

     Fred Murray leading NEW RECRUITS through the halls. He jokes
     around, as the OFFICERS eye him with respect.

     The PHONE RINGS. Kathy turns.

90   INT. GDA - AFTERNOON                                           90

     Kathy stands in disbelief. Laura is stern.

                         KATHY
               Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a
               UN investigation. I thought we were all
               on the same team.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               Irka can stay. But I can't keep Raya
               here. She is refusing to cooperate in the
               repatriation program.

                         KATHY
               Please, just let her stay two weeks. Then
               we can take it from there.

                         LAURA LEVIN
               We only house fourteen girls. It's a
               valuable spot.

                         KATHY
               Two weeks. If she's going to testify,
               she's not safe anywhere else.

     Laura shrugs, resigned.

91   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER                         91

     Kathy sits across from Raya. A TRANSLATOR to the side,
     translates as Raya speaks.

                         RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
               We were supposed to work in a hotel.
               (shaking her head) Now... I can be
               charged with prostitution?
                                                      TWB 45.


                    KATHY
          There is another option... I want to help
          you find your friends. But you need to
          help me do that.

Kathy takes out the photo of Fred Murray and lays it on the
table. Raya eyes it, defiant, no reason to trust her.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          None of this is your fault. I want to go
          after the people who hurt you. But I need
          to know exactly what happens. As a
          witness in UN custody, you will be
          protected and will not be charged for any
          crimes.

Raya stares, still not convinced.

                    RAYA
          I...

The translator starts. Raya stops her. Frustrated. Turning to
Kathy...

                    RAYA (BROKEN ENGLISH) (CONT'D)
          UN will protect me? They don't protect me
          when they drink in bar and fuck me and my
          friends.

Kathy is humbled. She looks at Raya, open, raw...

                    KATHY
          I have a daughter, just your age... I
          wouldn't stop until I found her.

The two women stare at each other. A silent connection. Raya
looks down, almost... ashamed. Struggling to get this out...

                    RAYA
          I only left because... there was nothing,
          no jobs, no... chances. I was good in
          school. But with no money... My mother...
          She is on her own. She works so hard. But
          nothing changes. I thought I could help
          her. He said we would work in a hotel.
          With good wages...

Tears gathering in her eyes... It's terrifying to remember...

                    RAYA (CONT'D)
          But... When we got there... Other girls
          were there. Like us. From Ukraine,
          Moldova, Romania, everywhere... We were
          in the middle of nowhere.
                    (MORE)
                                                              TWB 46.

                            RAYA (CONT'D)
                  Nobody could hear us... They... rape
                  us... One girl go crazy, screaming... He
                  shoots her. He shoots her right in the
                  head. Then we was... sold. Like animal.

     Raya is stopped by a rush of tears. Kathy reaches for her
     hand. Looking at this girl, so young...

     Raya looks Kathy squarely in the face. She slides the photo
     of Murray toward her.

                            KATHY
                  Do you know this man?

     Raya nods.

                            RAYA
                  He is not the only one. They come every
                  month. Tanjo give them money, so they
                  don't raid the bar. That day you come...
                  Tanjo did not want to pay. They want to
                  punish him. Take his money. His girls. I
                  ran...

     Raya sobs, knowing she has betrayed the system. Betting her
     life on the hope that this system won't betray her.

92   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - NIGHT                            92

     Milena leads Kathy through the halls.

                            KATHY
                  I need to get evidence. How many girls do
                  you have here?

                            MILENA
                  At least thirty five.

     MONTAGE:

     Kathy sits with GIRL after GIRL. Listening to their stories.
     Writing furiously...

     Kathy interviews EVA, 16. She talks through grateful tears.

                            EVA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                  ...Many of them come in. Uniforms like
                  you. Different flags on the shoulders. I
                  will testify. I don't care anymore. One
                  brings cigarette. His name is Peter...

     Kathy with a different girl, FADILA, 17.
                                                             TWB 47.


                         FADILA (MACEDONIAN)
               ...Sometimes if it's a party, a birthday,
               they pay for a group of girls, all
               together. Do whatever they want. Brian,
               the Irish guy, said Bosnia was better
               than Thailand for girls.

     Another girl, JASMILA, 18 - stunning, with haunted eyes.

                         JASMILA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
               The soldier from Italia say I was his
               girlfriend. I ask him to help me. But the
               bar owner pay him off. He has a tattoo of
               Tiger on his arm.

     Yet another, NADIA, 14, nodding.

                          NADIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
               Paolo come every week. He had a thin
               moustache, the other...here I have a
               picture...

     Kathy wasn't expecting that. Nadia throws down a photo.

                         NADIA (CONT'D)
               He loved the Firecracker.

     Nadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar.

     Kathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and
     U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face.

                         NADIA (CONT'D)
               They burn me. Then they laugh.

     Kathy eyes Nadia... Silently in awe of her strength.

                         KATHY
               Do you have any more pictures?

93   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                             93

     Kathy pins Nadia's photo on a large bulletin board. Steps
     back. The wall is covered in photos of girls.

     Kathy reaches for the phone. Dials.

                           ERIN (O.S.)
               ...Hello?

                         KATHY
               Erin. What are you doing?
                                                           TWB 48.


                         ERIN (O.S.)
               It's three in the morning, ma... I'm
               sleeping.

     Kathy sits back, relieved.

                         ERIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Mom, are you okay?

                         KATHY
               Yeah. I just was thinking about you.

                         ERIN
               Okay, can I go back to bed now?

                         KATHY
               Yeah. Of course, I just... It's great to
               hear your voice.

94   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                       94

     Kathy stands before Rick's desk. He smiles at her, convivial.

                         RICK JONES
               How're things?

                         KATHY
               Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar.
               It's worse than I thought. There was a
               protection racket. IPTF... Americans,
               Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make
               sure the place wasn't busted. That raid
               was a punishment bust, because the owner
               stopped paying. But he must've settled it
               because the girls are right back where
               they started. Locked up in the hills.

     Rick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished.

                         KATHY (CONT'D)
               I talked to thirty five girls at the
               Shelter. All this testimony can't be
               ignored. Our guys are patronizing the
               bars in large numbers. Rick, serious
               abuses are taking place. It's all in my
               reports.

     Kathy lays her stack of files on the desk.

                         RICK JONES
               Okay, let's back up a second here--
                                                           TWB 49.


                         KATHY
               I've got two girls ready to testify about
               IPTF taking pay-offs--

                         RICK JONES
               Testify where?

                           KATHY
               In court.

                         RICK JONES
               A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All
               International Personnel have immunity.

     Kathy is stopped.

                         KATHY
               I know. But there must be some channel,
               some exception--

                         RICK JONES
               Look, you've done really good work here.
               These are serious allegations. Let me
               look into how to handle it. I'll get back
               to you.

95   EXT. OLD TOWN - SARAJEVO - EVENING                             95

     The markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across
     the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`.

96   INT. KITCHEN - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                       96

     Jan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him.

                         JAN
               It's different for us. We're all military
               or police. Every contingent except for
               the U.S... if someone does something
               wrong, they have to answer to a military
               tribunal at home. With the Americans...
               your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have
               that.

                         KATHY
               So the Americans aren't legally
               accountable for anything?

                         JAN
               To be honest, I think our superiors would
               keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen
               a military tribunal.
                                                           TWB 50.


     Jan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the
     vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied.

                         JAN (CONT'D)
               You know my mission stay is up in a few
               weeks... You could come home with me.

                         KATHY
               To do what?

     She turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter.

                         JAN
               I was just... This place, y'know, it gets
               to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen
               to you a year from now.

     She puts down her glass of wine, irritated.

                         KATHY
               You don't need to worry about me.

                         JAN
               Someone does.

     She looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's
     love.

                         KATHY
               So Fred Murray could just walk up to a
               man and shoot him in daylight and he'd
               never see the inside of a courtroom?

                         JAN
               In Bosnia, yes... but... I mean,
               something that public could get him sent
               home. And tried in his own country.

     Kathy gets an idea.

97   EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - SARAJEVO - DAY                          97

     A crumbling edifice, once home to the world's finest, now a
     reminder of humanity's worst. INSIDE...

     Kathy walks with Madeleine, who unleashes Helen the hound.

                         MADELEINE
               Helen loves it here. I think she has
               Olympic ambitions.

     Kathy hands Madeleine the files. She flips through.
                                                             TWB 51.


                         KATHY
               I wanted these girls to testify in a
               trial against the IPTF officers. But--

                         MADELEINE
               The immunity problem.

                         KATHY
               Okay, but if the girls testify in a
               Bosnian court against their trafficker...
               Tanjo... they'd have to mention what else
               goes on in the brothels.

     Madeleine nods. The dog comes bounding back.

                         MADELEINE
               It could work. If you make certain that
               in their testimony they mention every
               sordid detail of IPTF involvement--

                         KATHY
               That is their testimony. Then it would be
               on record. Somebody would have to pay
               attention. Like...the State Department?

     Madeleine grins, proud.

                         MADELEINE
               They're gonna answer for this.

98   INT. BASEMENT - UNMHQ - DAY                                   98

     Kathy weaves around the corner of a dimly lit, shabby
     hallway. She arrives at a doorway: VEHICLE DISPATCH.

99   INT. VEHICLE DISPATCH - UNMHQ - MOMENTS LATER                 99

     Kathy talks to LEWIS, 20s, American.

                         KATHY
               ...and the two girls have to go to the
               hospital to get immunized, or they can't
               stay in the country. I need an armored
               security vehicle.

     Lewis looks at her, almost laughing.

                         LEWIS
               You're lucky you have a car at all. We're
               stretched to the limit. Besides, isn't
               this a local police matter? Try them.

      Kathy parks her SUV.

101   INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - DAY                               101

      Kathy walks into the station, drawing the attention of the
      LOCAL COPS. Danik rolls his eyes.

                          KATHY
                I'm looking for--

      Danik turns away...

                          DANIK (BOSNIAK)
                Viko... your American girlfriend is here!

      Kathy eyes Danik. Viko comes out, smiling broadly at Kathy.

102   EXT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER                     102

      Kathy and Viko walk out, energized with a sense of purpose.

                          VIKO
                It's no problem. The Van is just sitting
                here. Let's go.

      They arrive at a POLICE VAN. Kathy eyes it.

                          VIKO (CONT'D)
                It's not exactly armored, but it will do
                the trick. You follow me, yes?

      He jumps in, and starts it up. Kathy follows in her UN SUV.

      Across the street, a LOCAL MAN watches from INSIDE A CAR.

103   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - EVENING                                     103

      Kathy SWERVES up. Viko has the Van parked right up against
      the door. Kathy jumps out.

104   INT. FOYER - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                       104

      Laura leads a very scared Raya out. Kathy smiles, gentle.

                          KATHY
                (at Laura) Where's Irka?

      Laura takes a deep breath, eyeing Raya...

                          LAURA LEVIN
                I need to have a word with you.
                                                      TWB 53.


Kathy looks at her watch -- at Raya. Viko taps her shoulder.

                    VIKO
          I'll take her. Meet us when you're done.

As Viko and Raya leave, Kathy stops her...

                    KATHY
          I'll be right behind you. Are you okay?

Raya nods, trusting in Kathy. Who turns, angry, back to...

                    LAURA LEVIN
          I was going to call you. There was a
          problem. During our repatriation
          procedures, we realized Irka had no
          passport.

                    KATHY
          So we get her one. Where is she?

                    LAURA LEVIN
          You don't get it. She was trafficked from
          Belgrade. Her parents were killed in
          Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No
          embassy will recognize her. She is a girl
          without a country.

                    KATHY
          She is a witness for a UN investigation!

GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity.

                    LAURA LEVIN
          We handed her over to the police a few
          hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've
          already done every favour I could for
          you. This is not on me.

                    KATHY
          You had no right to do that!

                    LAURA LEVIN
          I had every right. We have a system that
          works here. You're the one disrupting it.

Kathy stares at her. Fuming.

                    KATHY
          Where did they take her?

Laura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit.

Just then the door opens. And...
                                                               TWB 54.


      HALYNA

      Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising...

                          HALYNA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                I... look for Laura Levin?

                             LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN)
                That's me.

      Kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura
      leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes
      landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting...

                          KATHY
                If you know anything, this is on you.

                          INTERN
                I think the cops leave them somewhere
                near the border, so that with no papers,
                the girls have to cross the border
                illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad.

105   INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT                                      105

      Kathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road.
      Seeing... Nothing but the 20 feet her headlights show.

                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

106   INT./ EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                         106

      Viko steers the Van around a corner. Raya sits in the back.

107   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SAME                 107

      Laura hands an excited Halyna a cup of tea.

                          LAURA (RUSSIAN)
                She'll be back in about an hour.

108   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       108

      Kathy's eyes GLUED on the road, trying to make out a SIGN...

      LANDMINES. Then another sign... VISEGRAD PRAVO.

      Sharp Turn. Onto a GRAVEL ROAD. She brakes. SKIDDING.

109   INT. POLICE VAN / EXT. SARAJEVO - SAME                        109

      Viko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the
      van. Seeing... Young WOMEN in the streets. Laughing.
                                                            TWB 55.


110   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       110

      Kathy slows her car... FLICKERING LIGHTS. She approaches...

      A BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows.

      BORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over.

                          KATHY
                I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped
                here a few hours ago.

      He shrugs, shaking his head.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                Can you check the border logs? She's
                about 15, the police brought her here but
                she didn't have a passport. Maybe--

                          GUARD
                Lady. I know what you're looking for.
                Those girls do not go through the border.
                They go through there...

      He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES.

                             GUARD (CONT'D)
                To Serbia.

      Kathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through
      the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road.

111   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          111

      Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view
      mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley.

112   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           112

      Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the
      top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up
      ahead...

      A SILHOUETTE. Kathy ACCELERATES.

113   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN ALLEY/SARAJEVO - SAME                    113

      Viko eyes the mirror. All clear. Turning onto a DESERTED
      STREET.

114   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           114

      Kathy HURTLES closer to the silhouette...
                                                               TWB 56.


      She turns. It's Irka. Kathy cranks the wheel, driving off the
      road and onto...

      A WIDE FIELD

      The SUV is jolted by the uneven terrain. Irka peers into the
      blinding light. Then runs...

115   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          115

      Viko drives up the deserted street. SUDDENLY two BATTERED
      MERCEDES fly out from SIDE ROADS and block the way.

      Viko BRAKES hard. Raya is thrown to the side of the Van.

116   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           116

      Kathy stops the car, jumps out, and runs after Irka.

                            KATHY
                Irka!

      Irka's legs start to give. Kathy gains on her.

117   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          117

      Viko REVERSES and TURNS -- but a Mercedes ROARS -- 'round the
      other side -- BASHING the side of the Van.

118   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           118

      Kathy feels Irka slowing down.

119   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          119

      Two MEN jump out of the cars. With RIFLES. Viko SPEEDS
      forward. But..

      GUNFIRE. Raya SCREAMS. A TIRE BLOWN OUT.

      The Van SKIDS to a HALT. Viko SMASHES against the window.

      Raya tries the doors, but they won't open. She wails,
      SLAMMING herself against the door. Desperate.

120   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           120

      Kathy raises her arms, waving...

      Irka turns. Kathy can see her clearly now, disoriented beyond
      bearing. Irka shields her face from the distant headlights.
                                                               TWB 57.


      Kathy steps out of their glare. And then...Irka recognizes
      her. She collapses, releasing confused tears. Kathy walks
      over, careful, slowly bending to help.

                          IRKA
                Please... let me die.

      Kathy holds her. As the young girl cries.

121   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          121

      The Men approach the Van. Raya's BANGING ECHOES from inside,
      reverberating around the empty street. Nobody can hear her...

122   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                              122

      Isolated stars peek through clouds, drifting over dark hills
      stretching far into the horizon....

123   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                           123

      Kathy and Viko sit silent. Barry hangs up the phone.

                          BARRY
                Okay. We've got a safe house in the
                mountains. Nobody knows she's here, so
                we're clear to take her there now.

      Kathy looks across the room to Irka, who sits hunched,
      looking out the window. Totally alone.

124   EXT. FARM HOUSE - MOUNTAINS - NIGHT                           124

      A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE lead Irka inside a small home. In the
      MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Shrouded in the black night. Nobody will
      find her here. In the doorway, Irka turns to Kathy and Viko.

                          IRKA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                Where is Raya?

      They stare back at her. The woman closes the door. Kathy and
      Viko stand in the dead silence. His face bruised.

                          KATHY
                Let's go back to the Florida Bar--

                          VIKO
                You think he'd be that stupid?

                          KATHY
                I don't care! I have nothing else to go
                on, do I?

      Adrenalin overtaking sadness. Viko follows Kathy to the car.
                                                               TWB 58.


125   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      125

      Kathy and Viko pull up. It's in full swing.

126   INT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      126

      They step inside, and IN ONE GLANCE, see... THE WHOLE SET OF
      GIRLS is different. No Luba, No Raya, No Tanjo... The IPTF
      barely notice her.

127   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      127

      Kathy steps out. Furious.

                          VIKO
                They moved them already.

                          KATHY
                Fuck!

      At the end of her rope.

128   INT. GDA - NIGHT                                              128

      Laura, at a total loss, eyes... Halyna. Sitting. Terrified.

                          HALYNA (RUSSIAN)
                ...How could? No, no, no... my, Raya....
                What!? What will they do to her?

129   EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT                                    129

      A BROWN VAN snakes through the distant mountain roads.

130   INT. BROWN VAN - SAME                                         130

      IVAN, 40s, drives. Tanjo is in the passenger seat.

                          TANJO (SERBIAN)
                We'll stop soon. We're far enough now.

      Ivan nods. Tanjo cranes into the back of the van. He turns on
      an overhead light, revealing...

      Five girls. Huddled in the back.

                          TANJO (RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
                So you want to testify?

      All the girls turn to... Raya. Their conscience paralyzed by
      the need to survive. Terrified, Raya looks to... Luba. Her
      eyes pleading for support. But Luba turns away.
                                                            TWB 59.


                          TANJO (CONT'D)
                It's okay. We all move to a new bar now.
                Somewhere no one will come look for you.
                Then we have a conversation.

      The girls avoid Raya's gaze. She sobs. Tanjo turns off the
      light. The van drives off into the unknown.

131   EXT. PARKING LOT - BACK ENTRANCE - UNMHQ - MORNING            131

      Kathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the
      day. Then she sees...

      Fred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when

      He sees Kathy, gazing over, serious.

132   EXT. PARKING LOT - UNMHQ- DAY                                 132

      Kathy and Fred walk between the parked cars.

                          KATHY
                She's fifteen. I'm begging you--

                          FRED MURRAY
                I don't know what you're talking about.

                          KATHY
                If you know any of the other bars he
                owns, anything... I'm appealing to--

                          FRED MURRAY
                Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time.
                And you can put this down in your
                investigation on me. I don't know what
                you're talking about.

      He leaves. Kathy stands, a black speck in the patchwork of
      white UN SUVs spread across the lot.

133   INT. RICK JONES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                          133

      Rick's SECRETARY shakes her head at Kathy.

                          SECRETARY
                I've called and paged. He says he can't
                get into this now.

                          KATHY
                Does he know that one of my witnesses was
                abducted? Where is he?

                          SECRETARY
                Sorry Kathy, he really didn't tell me.
                                                            TWB 60.


134   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - MORNING                        134

                          MADELEINE
                It's not your fault.

      Kathy is downcast. She nods, not totally convinced.

                           KATHY
                Irka won't testify now. It's completely
                understandable. She's way too scared. I
                just... I don't know what to do with her.
                The GDA won't take her and her
                traffickers will find her if she's in
                this city.

      Emotion taking over...

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                These girls are dragged into this country
                like cattle and then the system that's
                supposed to help them spits them right
                back out. It barely recognizes sex
                trafficking as a problem even though it's
                a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows
                it. Are we supposed to wait around for
                that to change?

                          MADELEINE
                Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy...
                Do you have a nice frock?

135   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                135

      Kathy stands in front of a mirror, in a black dress, her hair
      hanging down to her shoulders. She stands, awkward.

                          KATHY
                Really? You think it's okay?

      She turns to Jan and Carmen, sitting on her bed. Jan smiles.

                          JAN
                You're beautiful.

      But Carmen is tilting her head, doubtful.

                          CARMEN
                You can stop standing like a farmer's
                wife for starters. These people are
                dignitaries. You gotta up your game.

      She approaches her, and sweeps her hair up into an elegant
      chignon. She takes off her own earrings and puts them on
      Kathy. Jan nods, impressed. Kathy eyes herself, pleased.
                                                               TWB 61.


136   INT./EXT. CAR/SARAJEVO HILLS - EVENING                        136

      A WHITE VOLKSWAGON RABBIT speeds though the Sarajevo hills.
      Madeleine is elegant in a suit. Kathy looks at her black
      dress, self-conscious.

                             KATHY
                   Is there a specific way of addressing the
                   High Commissioner of the Mission?

                             MADELEINE
                   I call him Bill.

      Kathy nods, nervous. They pull into a circular drive...

137   EXT. U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER           137

      The house is incongruous in its context: Manicured gardens,
      remodelled facade. And tonight its BLACK TIE and CATERING.

      An elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is...

                             MADELEINE
                   (familiar) Mrs. Ambassador! How do we do?

                              JANET WELLS
                   We do what we can. Great to see you
                   Madeleine.

      Janet smiles with the delicatesse of a diplomatic spouse.

                             MADELEINE
                   I hope you don't mind, I've brought along
                   a friend. This is Kathy Bolkovac.

      Kathy holds out her hand, a little nervous.

                             JANET WELLS
                   Great. I need as many gal pals as I can
                   get. Look at this place.

      She gestures toward the room. A haze of cigar smoke hovers
      over the gaggle of men. Kathy's eyes zero in on

      Bill Hynes

      Surrounded by a group of JAPANESE DIPLOMATS. Bill notices her
      and Madeleine. He waves, familiar. Madeleine nods, humoring.

      AMBASSADOR JOHN WELLS, 40s, slides his hand on Janet's back.

                             AMBASSADOR WELLS
                   What are your thoughts on dinner?
                                                              TWB 62.


                          JANET WELLS
                I think people are still busy drinking.

      John shakes Madeleine's hand, darting his eyes over Kathy.

                          AMBASSADOR WELLS
                Speaking of, what can I get you ladies?

      Madeleine looks at Kathy.

                          KATHY
                Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, I'll have
                a wine please.

                          AMBASSADOR WELLS
                (nodding) Coming right up. Madeleine,
                white for you?

      Kathy notices the respect he shows her. Janet leads them in,
      chatting with Madeleine. Kathy surveys the room full of
      dignitaries.

138   EXT. BACK PATIO - U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT         138

      A stunning view of Sarajevo at night. Kathy stands alone. A
      waiter offers her a convoluted hors d'oeuvre. She takes it,
      gracious. Trying to figure out what it is when...

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Nice view, no?

      Kathy turns to... PETER WARD, 40s, smoking a cigarette.

                          KATHY
                Oh I... I just needed some air.

                          PETER WARD
                Trust me, I know the feeling. I hate
                these stuffy events. You never know
                anyone's agenda.

      He eyes her. She looks past him... At Bill Hynes. Peter sees.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                Oh... well that's a plan.

                          MADELEINE (O.S.)
                Actually, I had a different one in mind.

      Madeleine and Janet come through the door. Peter stubs out
      his cigarette, and moves back inside.
                                                            TWB 63.


                          MADELEINE (CONT'D)
                (arm around Janet) Behind every good
                man...

      PATIO - SHORT TIME LATER

      Janet's eyes betray empathy. She shakes her head, upset.

                          JANET WELLS
                They just left her there? At the border?
                Poor girl... Just the psychological
                trauma. How can I help?

                          KATHY
                She's very vulnerable to re-trafficking.
                Internationals got her in this situation.
                We owe her the chance to get out.

      Janet is keen to follow, but a little lost.

                          MADELEINE
                We want to repatriate Irka to the United
                States and find her a foster family. I
                was hoping you could use your influence--

      Janet holds up her hand, nodding emphatically.

                          JANET WELLS
                We're going to find her a home.

      Kathy eyes Madeleine. Impressed.

                          KATHY
                I also think the American embassy should
                be aware of some of the problems we're
                having with our officers.

      Madeleine interjects...

                          MADELEINE
                Your help with Irka's case can really
                raise awareness in the Mission around the
                issue of trafficking.

      Madeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the
      difference between a cop and a diplomat.

139   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                        139

      Kathy stands. Still in her dress, going through files. Proud
      of the night's accomplishments, but her eyes linger on the
      board of girls... On the picture of Raya's APB.
                                                             TWB 64.


140   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY MORNING                      140

      Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a
      field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road.

      He runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him.
      In the van... Ivan rolls down the window.

                           BOY (SERBIAN)
                 Can I come with you?

                              IVAN (SERBIAN)
                 Not today.

      The boy looks down, disappointed.

                           IVAN (CONT'D)
                 Tell your mother I'll be home for dinner.
                 Then you and I will go for a walk. I have
                 a present for you.

                           BOY
                 What is it?

      Ivan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away.

141   EXT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - BOSNIAN COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING    141

      The brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the
      back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE.

                            TANJO (SERBIAN)
                 You couldn't buy him a new one? You have
                 money now.

                           IVAN (SERBIAN)
                 I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I
                 had one like it.

      Tanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building.

                            TANJO
                 They're downstairs. I want to get them
                 out today.

142   INT. STAIRWELL - BOMBED OUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          142

      Ivan follows Tanjo down rickety steps. CRIES AND WHIMPERS
      GROW LOUDER as they descend into a

      BASEMENT

      TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door.
      Ushering Ivan INSIDE where...
                                                              TWB 65.


      GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look
      up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell.

      We realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo
      waves his fingers, methodically...

                          TANJO (RUSSIAN)
                C'mon, let's go.

      The girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but
      submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door.

                          TANJO (CONT'D)
                I want to show you what happens when YOU
                DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!!

      They jump back. His scream echoes. They move

      THROUGH THE HALL

      To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the
      door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo
      pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a

      BARREN ROOM

      And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE
      ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And
      we see that...

      Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT
      CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT.

                          RAYA
                Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

      But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain.

      Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A
      flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and
      drops... A PIPE onto the ground.

      The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now
      the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.

143   EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNHCR - DAY                            143

      Madeleine stands before a small group of REPORTERS.

                          MADELEINE
                The young woman, who shall remain
                anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim
                of sex trafficking and has survived
                horrific abuse.
                          (MORE)
                                                               TWB 66.

                          MADELEINE (CONT'D)
                Ordinarily she would be repatriated to
                her country of origin. But because she is
                an orphan, she finds herself without a
                home. I'm pleased to announce that we
                have found a foster family in the United
                States. I want to thank Janet Wells for
                her assistance in making this happen. I
                believe this can stand as a signal that
                the International community in Bosnia and
                beyond is finally ready to recognize the
                growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a
                human rights abuse as abhorrent as the
                war crimes that drew the International
                Community to intervene in Bosnia in the
                first place. Thank you.

                          REPORTER
                Now that the UN is finally recognizing
                sex-trafficking, how are you going to
                monitor it?

      Reporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back,
      proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches.

144   EXT. FRONT STEPS - UNHCR - SHORT TIME LATER                   144

      Kathy and Madeleine emerge, buzzing with their success.

                          MADELEINE
                Nothing on Raya?

      Kathy shakes her head, saddened.

                          KATHY
                I've sent an APB out to all police
                stations and UN field offices... But I'm
                pushing ahead with the other girls in
                Milena's shelter. I'm creating a photo-
                line-up using the UN ID database, so they
                can identify all internationals involved.
                We've got to make them accountable.

145   INT. CORRIDOR - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - SHORT TIME LATER     145

      Milena looks through a glass window into...

146   INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - EVENING        146

      Kathy sits with girls including Fadila, Nadia, Eva... She
      brings up ID PHOTOS of IPTF officers, scrolling down the
      page. Fadila points at one and nods, speaking. Kathy writes.

      Another girl, JASMILA, points at a picture of...
                                                            TWB 67.


      AN IPTF OFFICER. She nods.

      Kathy brings up a new page of ID PHOTOS. Flicking through
      page after page. The girls identify SEVERAL OFFICERS.

147   INT. PERSONNEL - UNMHQ - DAY                                147

      Kathy finds Carmen behind a computer.

                          KATHY
                I have a favour to ask.

                          CARMEN
                Shoot.

                          KATHY
                You have access to all transport vehicle
                checkouts, right?

                          CARMEN
                I'm a fountain of useless knowledge.

                          KATHY
                Can you see how often Fred Murray has
                checked out raid vehicles?

                          CARMEN
                Fred Murray?

      Kathy nods. Carmen looks at her, surprised.

                          CARMEN (CONT'D)
                Fred was sent home.

      Kathy stands back. Confused.

                          KATHY
                What? Why didn't anyone tell me. Is he
                being disciplined because of my--

      Carmen shakes her head.

                          CARMEN
                He's just gone. Meaning investigation
                over. They wanted him out of here. People
                are talking. Come on, let's get some
                lunch.

148   INT. CAFETERIA - UNMHQ - AFTERNOON                          148

      Kathy and Carmen at a table in the corner.
                                                            TWB 68.


                          CARMEN
                Kath, you gotta be careful. Look, I know
                you're doing your own thing and all, but
                you're investigating your colleagues.

                          KATHY
                You've seen what they're doing.

                          CARMEN
                I know. I know. I just, the stuff people
                are saying, I'm catching snippets, and
                I'm worried about you. Think about your
                kids.

      Kathy is silenced. Then... A TAP ON HER SHOULDER...

                          MONITOR
                Looking for you in Human Resources.

      Carmen eyes Kathy, concerned. Kathy follows the monitor
      toward the exit. MONITORS and CIVILIANS buzz about, talking.
      But all around Kathy, the air is silent. Some IPTF OFFICERS
      eye her, coolly. Is she paranoid?

149   INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                    149

      OFFICER BLAKELY smiles formally. Kathy shifts in her seat.

                          BLAKELY
                I'm John Blakely, Human Resources.

      Kathy eyes him, dubious.

                           BLAKELY (CONT'D)
                In going through your records, I see
                you've got quite a case load. It must be
                stressful.

                          KATHY
                (deadpan) A bit.

                          BLAKELY
                Would you say you're under extreme
                stress?

                             KATHY
                Excuse me?

                          BLAKELY
                There are concerns among some of your
                superiors that you've become impulsive,
                reckless in your position.

      Kathy sits, shocked.
                                                               TWB 69.


                          BLAKELY (CONT'D)
                We'd like to suggest taking some time
                off. You have some leave time...

      Kathy eyes him coolly. He slides over a booklet.

                          BLAKELY (CONT'D)
                See here? You can consolidate your leave.
                We'll contact our head offices in the
                U.K. and ensure none of your pay would be
                deducted... Just... Take a little
                vacation. Go home. See your kids.
                We're simply suggesting this out of
                concern for you.

                          KATHY
                Are you suggesting I take time off. Or
                are you telling me?

                          BLAKELY
                This is simply out of concern for you.

      Kathy pushes her chair back, and leaves.

150   INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                  150

      Kathy sits at the table, covered in photos of girls, flipping
      through the Dyncorp manual, irritated.

                          KATHY
                Consolidate my leave... A fucking
                vacation?

      She shakes her head, overwrought. Flipping through the
      manual, seeing...

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                Who are these people? (stopping on a
                page) And why does Dyncorp, a company
                that sends American peacekeepers, have
                it's corporate headquarters in England?

      She looks up at Jan. He shrugs, sympathetic, wanting to help.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                Of course I want to see my kids, of
                course. But... not like this. Not by
                being sent home like some hysterical
                woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to
                up and leave them. If I go home like
                this... It's like coming here, this whole
                thing was a... mistake.
                                                            TWB 70.


      She shakes her head, lost in thought... Maybe it was... Jan
      sits beside her, concerned.

                          JAN
                Nobody who knows you could think that.

                          KATHY
                Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects...
                It's one step forward, two steps back...

      Jan tries to jump in. But--

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                No, seriously. I'm just a cop from
                Nebraska. What do I know?

      Jan shakes his head.

                          JAN
                It's not what. It's who. You know them.

      He points at the files and photos of girls splayed all over
      the table. Kathy eyes them, torn between self-doubt and
      something much more instinctive...

151   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - EVENING              151

      Laura sits across from Halyna, who is heartbroken.

                          LAURA (RUSSIAN)
                Mrs. Kochan... It's been a few weeks now.
                I don't know if there's much point--

                          HALYNA (RUSSIAN)
                But we-- I must-- I have to do something.
                There has to be something I can do?!

      Laura takes a second. Suddenly struck with an idea.

152   EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                      152

      A large WOOD HOUSE with a neon CAMEL sits in the mountains
      above the city of TUZLA. A VAN pulls up.

153   INT. OASIS BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                153

      Raya, Luba follow Ivan up stairs. Ivan unlocks a

      BACK BEDROOM

      He bangs on a wall. FIVE GIRLS wake in cots on the ground. He
      motions for them to go in. They do.
                                                      TWB 71.


MARA, 19, hands Raya and Luba a piece of paper with CRUDE
DRAWINGS of SEXUAL POSITIONS. A price value by each.

                    MARA (RUSSIAN)
          You work in two hours.

Ivan and Mara leave, locking the door behind him.

The other girls go about their business, barely noticing Raya
and Luba. But JULIA and TANYA, 16, come over.

                    JULIA (RUSSIAN)
          You sleep on whichever mattresses are
          available. The last two girls in have to
          share.

                    TANYA (RUSSIAN)
          They bring us food in the morning. You
          have to eat it all, or you get fined.

Raya grabs her head. Feeling faint. She looks for a place to
sit. Julia and Tanya help her to the ground.

                    JULIA
          Don't let him see you like this.

Luba walks over to the other side of the room. Finds a spot
and sits. Raya watches her, hurt. Julia pushes a mattress
aside. Underneath is a... COUNTING SYSTEM scratched into the
floor. Each girls' name scratched with numbers beside it.

                    JULIA (CONT'D)
          I'm the closest. Then I can go home.

Raya barely has the energy to hold herself up.

                    TANYA
          What's your name?

                    RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
          Rayisa...Raya Kochan.

Tanya scratches Raya's name into the floor. Then one mark.

                    LUBA (RUSSIAN)
          It's all bullshit--

                    JULIA
          No! He sent a girl back three months ago.
          I was here! (to Luba) What is your name?

Raya eyes Luba who's conflicted between loyalty to her friend
and her own sense of survival. Luba tears up, but turns away.
                                                            TWB 72.


                          RAYA
                (softly) Her name is Luba. Luba Pankiw.

154   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         154

      Kathy works, angry, urgent now. On her desk...

      CLOSER: REPORT: PHOTO ID LINE-UP. Kathy matches circled ID
      photos of IPTF alongside testimony and Polaroids of girls.

      She works fast. Circling the photos, slapping files closed.
      When a...

      MAIL BOY slides in a cart, and places a stack of REPORTS on
      Kathy's IN-BOX. She pulls the first one off the top...

      A sticky note on the first page: Insufficient Evidence.

      Kathy grabs another... Sticky note: Unreliable Witness. She
      sees the name NADIA at the top of the statement.

      She grabs... ANOTHER: Unreliable Witness. And another...

      Transferred to Internal Affairs.

      Kathy flies through the rest of the files. One after another:

      Insufficient Evidence -- Insufficient Evidence -- Transferred
      to Internal Affairs --Unreliable Witnesses -- Insufficient --

      A photo falls out of one of them: RAYA. Kathy stares at it.

      Her eyes wander over the room, and fall on her predecessor's
      battered old file boxes, still waiting for Archives.

      She moves to them. Cuts the string on the top box. Rips the
      top off. Inside...

      REPORT FILES. Slotted in tight. She grabs one. STICKY NOTE:

      Insufficient Evidence.

                          KATHY
                Jesus.

      She starts RIPPING through them all -- YELLOW STICKY NOTES on
      all of them.

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                Kath...

      It's Jim Higgins, out of breath, in the doorway...
                                                            TWB 73.


                          JIM HIGGINS
                They've called an assembly for all
                Dyncorp personnel.

155   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNMHQ - NIGHT                         155

      Kathy and Jim walk into a room filled with DYNCORP BOYS.

                          JIM HIGGINS
                Anyone know what this is about?

      No one does. Kathy sits amongst the guys. Until...

      Rick walks up to the front.

                          RICK
                I have some not so pleasant news, but
                bear with me. (Off a prepared statement)
                Lately, local police have raided some
                houses of `ill repute' and a number of
                `ladies of the evening' have been taken
                into custody. While the credibility of
                these witnesses is questionable,
                apparently photo line-ups have been made
                available to them.

      Rick eyes Kathy, pointedly.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
                This issue is currently receiving a lot
                of attention. Guys, you gotta be
                careful... Kathryn Bolkovac is heading up
                this investigation. If you have any
                questions refer them to her.

      ALL EYES ON KATHY. They disperse, passing her, camaraderie
      obliterated. Kathy walks, livid...

                          KATHY
                You've given every officer time to create
                an alibi.

                          RICK
                I'm not going to subject my men to this
                witch hunt based on the testimony of some
                hookers! Prostitution is illegal! Your
                witnesses are criminals.

      Kathy can't believe what he's saying.

                          KATHY
                They are SLAVES. By any American or
                International law.
                                                             TWB 74.


                          RICK
                These slaves are lying about their
                presence in Bosnia. You are coming after
                American Officers with baseless claims.

                          KATHY
                ...you know they're not baseless.

                          RICK JONES
                If you've got a problem, go call the
                Ambassador's wife.

156   INT./EXT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - EVENING                           156

      ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. Kathy comes out. Seeing... IPTF
      OFFICERS. All eyeing her. She hurries through them.

157   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              157

      Kathy sits, anxious. Jan touches her back.

                          JAN
                They hired you to do a job they don't
                want done. It's a P.R. position.

      She turns to him.

                          KATHY
                Rick publicly outed me, jeopardizing
                those girls. I have to go over his head.
                But I... I never thought I'd have to go
                into Internal Affairs. The guys back home
                would never understand this.

                          JAN
                I understand you.

                          KATHY
                Yeah? And how long do you plan on being
                around, because the last two guys who
                said that aren't here.

                            JAN
                Don't.

                          KATHY
                It's just I waited so long you know. I
                want my kids to know I did something, to
                be proud.

                            JAN
                They are.
                                                            TWB 75.


                          KATHY
                No. Your kids are proud. You go on this
                mission and you're a big hero. I go and
                I'm a bad mother... (tearing up) I can't
                believe I'm gonna disappoint them again.

                            JAN
                So don't.

      He comes closer. She looks up. Decided.

158   INT./EXT. CAR - PARKING LOT - UNMHQ - EARLY MORNING        158

      A blast of light through Kathy's windshield. The lot is
      empty. She looks at a PILE OF REPORTS on the passenger seat.

159   INT. LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING                       159

      Kathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an
      OFFICER. She drops some files. He moves around her, as she
      bends to pick them up. She walks the rest of the hall,
      focused, and stops at a brass plaque: INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

160   INT. OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING           160

      Kathy marches in, nervous... MONITORS turn and see her,
      knowing who she is, but trying not to show it. She approaches
      a MALE MONITOR at a desk in the front.

                          MALE MONITOR
                What can I do for you?

      The Monitor keeps typing as she talks. Kathy hesitates, then

                          KATHY
                It's, I need to speak in-camera with a
                senior IA official. I don't have a name,
                but--

      Kathy recognizes Peter Ward working in a back OFFICE. He sees
      her, then closes the door.

                          MALE MONITOR
                Just a moment please.

161   INT. CLOSED OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNMHQ - DAY        161

      Kathy sits across from an IA OFFICIAL, 50s. He skims through
      the reports, nodding.
                                                            TWB 76.


                          KATHY
                I did a photo ID line-up with victims who
                testified to international patronizing of
                brothels, as well as complicity in
                trafficking itself.

      He looks at her.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                All the cases I filed to my superiors
                have come back, shut down. Some of them
                were marked as referred to IA.

                          OFFICIAL
                I haven't seen those.

                             KATHY
                Really?

      He shakes his head, standing.

                          OFFICIAL
                It's possible they're still in the
                pipeline, in preliminary processing. I'm
                sorry to have to rush this, but I have to
                get to a meeting. Thanks for coming in.

      He hands her a form.

                          OFFICIAL (CONT'D)
                You need to sign here, that you're asking
                for these investigations.

162   EXT. HILLS - NIGHT                                          162

      Kathy jogs along a ridge, with a view high over Sarajevo.
      Determined, panting... she pushes past her fatigue.

163   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                    163

      Kathy comes in, soaked in sweat. The PHONE RINGS. She rushes
      to it. CALLER ID: Unknown Number. She picks up, breathless.

                          KATHY
                Hello?... Sorry, who is this?... Just one
                second...

      She grabs a pen and pad. Writing: THE HOLIDAY INN. 513.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                Can I get your name? Hello? Hello?

      She looks at the phone, spooked.
                                                            TWB 77.


164   INT. LOBBY - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY               164

      Kathy moves through the lobby, scanning the scene of liquid
      lunches and diplomats. She keeps her head low, focused

      ON THE ELEVATORS

      Ding. The doors open. Kathy steps in. As they close... TWO
      DIPLOMATS slip in. The elevator ascends. Kathy stares dead
      ahead.

165   INT. HALLWAY - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                    165

      Kathy stands at door 513. She takes a moment, then knocks.

166   INT. HOTEL ROOM - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                 166

      Kathy is led in by Peter Ward. She comes inside, tentative,
      unsure who she's dealing with. Peter smokes furiously, a
      burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes
      betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into
      this world. He seems nervous.

                          KATHY
                That was you today, in IA?

                          PETER WARD
                (nodding) Would you like a drink?

      Kathy eyes him, dubious. He pours her a drink.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                I saw your files...

      Kathy nods. Peter slaps down a file. Kathy looks at it.

                          KATHY
                What's this?

                             PETER WARD
                Your file.

                          KATHY
                I don't understand.

                          PETER WARD
                They're investigating you.

      Kathy stares at him.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                Don't you get it? They're circling the
                wagons... What did he tell you? He hadn't
                seen anything from you until today.
                                                        TWB 78.


She nods.

                      PETER WARD (CONT'D)
            Bullshit. Top Level Dyncorp commanders
            are walking into IA and removing your
            files. I've been told to shut down all
            your investigations.

                      KATHY
            Why?.. There has to be some sort of an
            international court or body that can turn
            this around--

                      PETER WARD
            The United Nations. You're here.

Peter thinking about how to put this...

                      PETER WARD (CONT'D)
            Dyncorp's contract with the State
            Department in Bosnia alone is worth 52
            million dollars. We're paid ninety, a
            hundred grand, right?. But it's a drop in
            the ocean compared to their profits. This
            is a global corporation, top five defense
            contractors in the states after
            Halliburton and KB&R. You think they're
            gonna let some sex scandal threaten that?

                      KATHY
            I don't want a scandal. I just want--

                      PETER WARD
            NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU. It's designed
            that way. No oversight. No national or
            international accountability.

                      KATHY
            Dyncorp's Headquarters are in England--

                      PETER WARD
            Exactly. Nothing leads back to the State
            Department. That includes you... So if
            something were to happen to you it
            wouldn't even make the news at home... No
            one would ever know... Poof. You're gone.

Kathy sits. Scared. Finally understanding the world she's in.

O.S. VOICES. Kathy jolts. Peter moves to the door.

THROUGH THE EYE-HOLE: A COUPLE checks in across the room.

Peter turns back. Sees a panic-stricken Kathy.
                                                              TWB 79.


                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                If you're going to keep going, you've got
                to stay under the radar. Make copies of
                all your files, keep them under lock and
                key. Just... Be careful... And know who
                you're up against.

167   EXT. PARKING LOT - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY         167

      Kathy. Unstrung. She crosses the labyrinth of WHITE SUVs. She
      looks up at the OSCE towers. Feeling watched.

      TWO SFOR SOLDIERS walk toward her. Eyeing her. She slips a
      car key between her fingers, arming herself. Watching them
      as... They pass. Kathy picks up her pace. Getting to...

      HER SUV. Her pulse RACING. PARANOID. She checks around...
      The lot is empty. Quiet. She is alone.

168   EXT. UNITED NATIONS MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY                168

      A row of international flags flap in the wind.

169   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SAME                            169

      Kathy watches the flags. She shifts her gaze to the bulletin
      board. Eyeing the picture of Raya. Then... she moves to...

      THE FILE CABINET. She pulls out   EVERY FILE. Photocopies them.
      Then... Opens the bottom filing   cabinet -- pushes files to
      the front -- placing the copies   in the back. She steps
      away... Closes the Cabinet. And   locks it...

      Knowing she is operating outside of protocol now.

170   INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - EVENING                       170

      Raya stares at herself in a mirror. Dressed as a whore.

171   INT. OASIS BAR - EVENING                                      171

      It's more of a medium-sized hall. A bar, some tables and a
      few `home touches'. Maps of Yugoslavia. Pictures of Tito.

      And FULL OF IPTF. Raya walks through, ogled. She sees...

      Luba, sitting on Mara's lap. Surrounded by TEN IRISH
      SOLDIERS. The soldiers ply them with drinks, `winning' them
      with charm. Luba blends in with remarkable ease.

                          RORY
                You feel like a party?

      RORY, Irish, grabs Raya's hand.
                                                            TWB 80.


                          RAYA
                (forcing) Yes... of course.

      He leads her to the back of the bar. Raya looks to Luba, but
      realizes she is alone.

      They walk through a BACK DOOR into a ROOM FULL OF BEDS
      SEPARATED with CURTAINS. We barely make out the shapes of
      various soldiers with girls in each cubicle. All busy. Until

      A curtain opens... And Jim Higgins walks out. His rite of
      passage complete.

      Rory pulls Raya to the cubicle, as Julia comes out.

172   EXT. SARAJEVO AIRPORT - EVENING                              172

      Halyna boards a plane with PASSENGERS, but without Raya.

173   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               173

      Kathy opens the door into the empty apartment, seeing a
      RAPIDLY BLINKING LIGHT on a digital display: 14 MESSAGES.

                          ANSWERING MACHINE
                Click. Click. Click.

      Each message a silence followed by a hang-up. Kathy stares at
      the blinking light as the clicks keep coming. CLICK, CLICK,
      CLICK... She rips the machine out of the wall.

174   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATER                               174

      We hear a DIAL UP CONNECTION. Kathy's at her computer. She
      brings up a Yahoo! Search page. TYPES IN: RICK JONES

      2103 Matches for Rick Jones.

      She types again. CLOSE ON: RICK JONES + COLORADO SPRINGS

      482 Matches for Rick Jones + Colorado Springs

      She scans down the page. None of the matches work. She shakes
      her head, about to give up, when...

      Chief of Police R. Jones in $1,000,000 Law Suit

      A PICTURE of Rick Jones accompanies the article.

      CLOSE ON WORDS: Richard Jones Fired for Sexual Harassment

175   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                     175

      Kathy sits at the empty kitchen table looking at the picture
      of her kids. She holds her head in her hands.

176   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - SARAJEVO SUBURBS - NIGHT    176

      Distant music echoes through the night. VOICES of GUYS
      hanging out on their balconies. Kathy crosses the lot,
      cutting through the dark night fog.

177   INT./EXT. SUV/ROAD - NIGHT                                    177

      Kathy drives. Wide awake. The only vehicle on the road.

178   EXT. ILIDZA STATION - NIGHT                                   178

      Kathy sits in the SUV. Staring at the station. THROUGH THE
      WINDOW... Jan works the late shift alone.

179   INT. ILIDZA STATION - NIGHT                                   179

      Jan and Kathy sit. Several empty coffee cups.

                          KATHY
                This is... I can't believe your timing...

                          JAN
                It's a rotation. They're sending us back
                a month early. I tried to get an
                extension, but...

      Kathy just stares ahead. Silent... a long time.

                          KATHY
                I'm not even sure I'm staying.

      Jan sits back. Stunned.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                These guys... Jones is a sexual offender.
                Dyncorp hired him... These private
                militaries are a sham. There's no way
                around them.

                          JAN
                If that's what your instincts are telling
                you...

                          KATHY
                I have children, I have to think about
                them...
                                                              TWB 82.


180   INT. OASIS BAR - LATE NIGHT                                  180

      A big IPTF PARTY. AT THE BAR: Raya waits with an empty tray.
      Luba pulls out a heavy crate of bottles. She hurts her back.

                          RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
                Here, I'll help you.

      Luba slams two bottles on Raya's tray.

                          LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
                I'm fine. I earned this job.

                          RAYA
                I was just trying to--

                          LUBA
                Don't. You'll get us in trouble.

      An IPTF OFFICER, MIKE SEARS grabs Raya from behind. Shakes
      her, jokingly. She laughs, familiar. Almost routine..

                          MIKE SEARS
                How's my favorite girl?

                          RAYA
                I am good. Everything good.

      She smiles, hollow and takes the tray over to a TABLE. Julia
      and Tanya sit with FOUR MEN in suits. They're plastered.

                          SUIT 1 (GERMAN ACCENT)
                I wanna party all night.

      The girls smile, nodding, playing along...

                          SUIT 2 (AMERICAN)
                Let's go out. I wanna take you home.

      He squeezes Tanya tight to him, kissing her sloppily.

                          SUIT 2 (CONT'D)
                Ivan! C'mere!

      Raya eyes Julia. Ivan comes over, smiling, a gregarious host.

                          SUIT 2 (CONT'D)
                We wanna party on mate. How much to take
                them home for the day?

      Ivan eyes the girls. Thinking...
                                                            TWB 83.


                          IVAN
                Ten times normal. Pay upfront. And extra
                deposit. But you cannot take her.

      He points at Raya.

                          IVAN (CONT'D)
                Three thousand each. (off their scoffing)
                You bring back, you get back deposit.

      Ivan smiles. The other two men are dubious. But Suit 1 and
      Suit 2 exchange glances... Daring each other.

                             SUIT 1
                You're on.

      Ivan waves to follow him. They walk with Julia and Tanya.
      Raya watches Ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey. They pay him.

      Julia catches Raya's eye. They exchange... A look of promise.

181   EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING                                     181

      The DUTCH CONTINGENT boards a bus. Kathy stands aside with
      Jan. Saying goodbye... Franz pats Jan on the back.

                          FRANZ
                I'll keep an eye out.

      Jan shakes his hand. Franz winks at Kathy.

                          FRANZ (CONT'D)
                (to Kathy) It's finally our time.

      She smiles, soft. Drained of energy.

                          JAN
                Get outta here.

                          FRANZ
                Anything you need you call, okay? He'll
                kill both of us if you don't.

      Franz moves away leaving the two alone. Jan hugs Kathy.

                          JAN
                You come to me... when you're done.

      He kisses her. The bus engines start.

182   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                            182

      Kathy watches out the window. DIPLOMATS walk the halls.
                                                            TWB 84.


                          MADELEINE
                What's this I hear about you leaving?

      Kathy turns to Madeleine in the doorway.

                          KATHY
                How'd you--

                          MADELEINE
                The Dutch Officer rang before he left.
                C'mon, I want to show you something.

      Kathy follows, downbeat.

183   INT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                     183

      The girls clean. Raya sweeps, watching Mara teach Luba how to
      restock the bar. Ivan comes out of the OFFICE. A bag in hand.

184   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY                            184

      Madeleine's UN Volkswagon pulls up. Milena waits, smiling.

                          MADELEINE
                After we got Irka repatriated, I had some
                calls from other private parties that
                were interested in helping. We've
                gathered $40,000 so far. I've applied for
                matching funds, so that... we can
                completely rebuild this shelter.

                          MILENA
                Separate from the GDA. We run it our way.
                The victims come first.

                          MADELEINE
                Things are changing Kathy.

      Kathy is moved, seeing a light at the end of this. The three
      women stand, united... Then... A SHELTER VOLUNTEER comes out.

                          SHELTER VOLUNTEER
                There's an important call inside.

                             MILENA
                Excuse me.

                          SHELTER VOLUNTEER
                No. The call is for Kathy.

185   EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                     185

      Ivan puts a bag in a car trunk. He turns to... Mara
                                                               TWB 85.


                            IVAN (RUSSIAN)
                  Remember I can bring you back here the
                  second you fuck up.

      Mara nods. He shakes her hand. Ivan hands her a passport. She
      jumps into the car. It's an odd farewell. Ivan heads back to

      THE OASIS

      He scans the room. His eyes land on Luba. Raya watches Ivan
      nod to Luba. A silent exchange: Luba accepts Mara's role.

      SUDDENLY... HONKING. OUTSIDE a car speeds up.

      The two SUITS from last night appear at the door... Without
      the girls.

186   INT./EXT. KATHY'S UN SUV - SHORT TIME LATER                   186

      Kathy slows... Seeing local police in the distance.

187   EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE SARAJEVO - CONTINUOUS                 187

      Kathy pulls up. Through gathered local cops, REVEAL...

      Julia and Tanya. Disoriented. Still in last night's clothing.

188   EXT. ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER                                 188

      Julia and Tanya are FRANTIC, talking fast.

                            JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                  They take us home. They were so drunk. We
                  run.

                            TANYA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                  There are more girls! You must to get
                  them out! Go now!

      They appeal to Kathy.

                            JULIA
                  Oasis Bar. In mountains.

      Kathy eyes Viko. As the girls talk at her, Kathy knows she
      was never going home. THIS is where she needs to be.

189   INT. HALLWAY - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                     189

      Kathy brings Julia and Tanya in. An Intern leads them down
      the hall. Viko comes in...

                            VIKO
                  Should I call for a raid?
                                                            TWB 86.


                          KATHY
                No. He'll walk. We have no proof they
                were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See
                what else they know.

190   INT. OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SHORT TIME LATER                  190

      Laura watches video footage on a TV. Halyna appears on the
      monitor. Her assistant PAUSES it.

                          ASSISTANT
                That's their first cut. I'll pass on your
                notes, and they should have it ready for
                the grant proposal in time.

      A KNOCK at the door.

191   INT. LOBBY - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                      191

      Kathy stands, curt now with Laura. All business.

                          KATHY
                I have no options right now. The GDA is
                more secure than Milena's shelter... Can
                they stay before you do the paperwork?

                          LAURA LEVIN
                They'll go on record?

      Kathy nods. Laura shrugs in assent.

192   INT. KITCHEN - GDA BOSNIA - LATER                            192

      Kathy listens to a tearful Julia.

                          JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                Ivan is good friends with the soldiers.
                They come all the time.

                          KATHY
                And you're saying these soldiers brought
                you into Bosnia. Through the border?
                You're sure?

                          JULIA
                Yes. In a van. White van. Like yours.

      They both nod. Emphatic. Kathy thinks...

                          KATHY
                They had uniforms? Like mine?

      The girls nod again. Absolutely sure.
                                                              TWB 87.


                          JULIA
                April 8. I never forget. The day I leave
                my home. We come to Bosnia some day
                later. I know because we stop at the
                border. We were six of us. Men from the
                border, they opened the doors... We give
                them our fake passports. My name was
                Irena Woycek. I thought they would see
                the fake passports, I thought...

      She hesitates, the memories flooding back...

                          JULIA (CONT'D)
                I thought they would save us.

193   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - DAY                                        193

      Viko follows Kathy out.

                          VIKO
                If there are records showing those girls
                came through the border with IPTF--

                          KATHY
                Then you have conspiracy to traffick.
                And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's
                enough to do a raid that will stick.

                          VIKO
                The main border station keeps the logs.

      Kathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an
      old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car).

194   INT./ EXT. TRABANT - NIGHT                                   194

      The ride is bumpy. Viko shouts over the engine...

                          VIKO
                Best if it looks like a local matter. Get
                more info. You be my UN monitor, okay?

      Kathy smiles, cramped, but appreciative of his help.

195   EXT. BORDER POLICE STATION - NIGHT                           195

      Viko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac
      Computer. Kathy notices a calendar of Pamela Anderson
      frolicking in foamy surf.

                          VIKO
                So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep
                all this on file here?
                                                               TWB 88.


                          BORDER COP
                Of course! It's our fucking job!

                          VIKO
                And other stations up the border send all
                their files to you?

                          BORDER COP
                Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance.

      Disappointing. Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop.

                          BORDER COP (CONT'D)
                You say 30 minutes outside Sarajevo?
                Maybe Visegrad? You might be lucky. Lanky
                guy in their archives loves to send
                files.

      Kathy looks hopefully at Viko, who shrugs. Clicking...

                          BORDER COP (CONT'D)
                Okay, 11th... (mumbling) ... No, no. You
                like?.. Big exciting to watch Bosnian
                police do boring things?

      Kathy smiles. He turns back, clicking. Then stops.

                          BORDER COP (CONT'D)
                You owe me! UN vehicle with 6 girls in
                back. Stanley Harris.

      He turns proudly to them.

                          BORDER COP (CONT'D)
                What you think? All his little sisters
                come to visit from America?

      Viko looks knowingly at Kathy.

                          KATHY
                That's it. Conspiracy to traffick.

      He slaps a key. The file prints out on an old daisy-wheel
      printer. Kathy scans the pages...

196   EXT. BORDER STATION - MOMENTS LATER                           196

      Kathy and Viko hurry to the car.

                          KATHY
                We arrest the buyer first. The bar-owner.
                The border log corroborates the victims'
                testimony. Once he's in custody, we raid
                his place and get those girls out.
                                                              TWB 89.


      Kathy jumps INSIDE THE CAR...

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                The raid has to be small. No-one knows
                the bar till we're on our way.

197   INT. RECEPTION - BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - EVENING        197

      Kathy waits, nervous, holding the border logs. The
      RECEPTIONIST eyes her.

                          RECEPTIONIST
                He shouldn't be long now.

198   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                      198

      Bill on the edge of his desk. Kathy paces, frantic...

                          KATHY
                That's why I came straight to you. They
                were brought across the border by our
                guys. I need two back-up security vans
                for a raid, with well-trained--

                          BILL HYNES
                Our resources are tight. I have to
                prioritize--

                          KATHY
                (holding the border logs) This is real
                evidence. And that's just a drop in the
                ocean. I have hundreds of files. Photos,
                corroborated statements. We can build
                this case and get the perpetrators out of
                the mission--

      Bill shakes his head.

                          BILL HYNES
                If I could give you a piece of advice it
                would be to think of the future.

                          KATHY
                These girls--

                          BILL HYNES
                Are Collateral Damage. Whores of War.
                It's nothing new. Every conflict produces
                them.

                          KATHY
                You know as well as I do, those girls
                aren't a product of the war.
                          (MORE)
                                                              TWB 90.

                          KATHY (CONT'D)
                They're a product of the peace. For the
                peace-keepers.

      Kathy is repulsed. Bill takes a seat.

                          BILL HYNES
                This is your first mission. You're eager.
                But we work in a very grey area and that
                can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to
                take the gloves off but they don't want
                us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking
                Catch-22. So what do we do? We
                prioritize. We do our best and we always
                look at the bigger picture. You're a
                mother. Fine. I see what you're doing
                with these girls. Maybe that's why you're
                thinking with your heart not your head.
                But you have a chance at a career in the
                international sector. Ride this out. Get
                a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia,
                Afghanistan... I don't give a shit. And
                then, when you're running the show, you
                can implement whatever changes you see
                fit. But right now be smart and shut this
                bullshit down!

      The veil is lifted. Kathy stands frozen. The blunt workings
      of the machine are laid bare.

199   EXT. PLAZA - UNMHQ - DAY                                      199

      Kathy leans on a balcony overlooking the main plaza at HQ.
      She observes the sleek facade of honor and power.

      She straightens, and walks away without looking back.

200   INT. LOCAL CANTON STATION - NIGHT                             200

      A RAID TEAM suits up: FIVE LOCAL COPS and THREE IPTF
      OFFICERS. Viko turns and hands Kathy a helmet.

                          KATHY
                (to Viko and other cops) Try and get him
                outside first, then arrest him. Once
                you've got him outta there we'll go in. I
                want the girls to know they're safe.

201   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                          201

      A police vans SPEEDS down the road. TWO UN VANS follow.

202   INT. UN VAN - SAME                                            202

      Kathy focuses in the cabin filled with SUITED IPTF OFFICERS.
                                                               TWB 91.


203   EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT                                        203

      Viko pulls up to the bar. The UN SUV skids into the shadows.

      Viko and Danik go inside. Kathy glances back at her IPTF
      officers as they -- Pull their visors down, and WAIT -- Quiet
      -- Wind in the trees -- MUSIC ECHOING from inside as...

      Viko and Danik emerge, chatting with Ivan. Suddenly...

      Ivan jolts back -- COPS grab him -- He's YELLING --
      HANDCUFFED -- Kicking. Punching -- They PUSH him into the VAN
      -- Viko SLAMS the door, turns to the UN van and nods...

204   INT. UN VAN - CONTINUOUS                                      204

      Kathy looks back to the IPTF officers, raises three
      fingers... then TWO...ONE...

      The POLICE VAN SQUEALS AWAY, as...

      They SLAM open the doors of the bar and RUSH INTO...

205   INT. OASIS BAR - CONTINUOUS                                   205

      BURSTING in the doors -- Clients scatter -- RUSH to the EXITS

      Girls turn from the bar, the stage, the seating area --
      disoriented -- eyes darting...

      Local police spread around the bar, slamming, pushing clients
      outside. Kathy pulls off her helmet and SCANS the room.

                          VIKO
                We have a warrant to search this
                premises. The owner of this bar Ivan
                Bladzic has been arrested and taken into
                custody for human trafficking.

      The girls look at one another. Is this for real? The BARMAN
      steps forward... He looks like he's had a few drinks.

                            BARMAN
                Fuck you!

      Kathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear...

      Danik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these
      girls... His face softens. He looks to Kathy for direction.

                          KATHY
                You do not have to be afraid of Ivan
                Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now.
                                                         TWB 92.


But the GIRLS don't move...

Kathy looks out -- Stunned -- Because she sees...

Raya. Standing. Shocked. No idea who to trust anymore. One
last shred left of the dream of escape...

Kathy goes to her. But Raya's eyes dart to... Luba.

Then to Kathy, recognizing the last kind face she saw...

                    BARMAN (BROKEN ENGLISH)
          These girls work here. They have all
          documents, passports! You can fuck off.

Two local cops GRAB him. Danik CUFFS him.

The girls are astounded. Viko holds up passports.

                    VIKO
          Fakes. Bad ones.

The barman is dragged outside. Kathy scans the girls. Ending
on Raya... her faith awakening.

                    KATHY
          We want to get you out of here safely.
          That is my absolute priority.

The girls exchange a flurry of looks, speaking volumes...
Should we trust her? Can we risk it?

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          (To Viko) Get those blankets out of the
          vans. Let's get these girls out.

But the girls still don't move... Raya. Fractured with
despair... After all she has been through, all the
punishment, all the pain...

Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced...

And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When...

Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears.
He stares at Raya. Petrifying her.

Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her
gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out
of earshot of the others...
                                                        TWB 93.


                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          You just have to tell me you want to go.
          That you do not work here voluntarily.
          And we will get you to safety.

Raya wants so badly to answer.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          You can leave with me this second. All of
          you can. But I need you to say it.

Raya eyes Mike Sears - He looks to Luba. Luba turns back to
Raya - Pleading -- Don't do it.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          You know me.

Raya can't look at Kathy. Tears stream down her face.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          You can all leave with me! (to Raya)
          Let's go.

Raya. With her heart breaking...

                      RAYA
          No.

Kathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between
Mike and Kathy... And she understands...

Kathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar -- SHOVING him
to the door -- SLAMMING him against the wall.

                    KATHY
          Who the fuck are you? What have you done?
          What's wrong with you? What's wrong with
          you? You fuck!

Mike pushes back...

                    MIKE
          Get off me, you crazy bitch!

                    KATHY
          They're supposed to TRUST US!

Viko and Danik pull them apart.

                    VIKO
          C'mon Kathy. It's over.
                                                            TWB 94.


      She steps back -- Catching her breath -- Shaking her head --
      NOT AGAIN... She looks at Raya, tears streaming down her
      terrified face...

                          KATHY
                I know this girl. I know her. We can't
                leave them here. We're supposed to--

                          VIKO
                If they won't come, we can't force them.
                Nothing will hold up in court. They'll be
                returned and punished... Do you want
                blood on your hands?

      The girls all return to their positions behind the bar,
      cleaning, sitting around the edges... Not one will catch...

      Kathy's eye. She glares at Mike Sears.

      Kathy watches across the room, devastated...

      As Raya turns, giving up her last chance to leave, and exits
      to a back room.

206   EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT                                        206

      Kathy paces frantically in the darkness. Eyes wild.

      Viko comes out the door, as it hits her like a blunt kick in
      the face: sheer helplessness...

      She TURNS - Fuck diplomacy, Fuck bureaucracy, Fuck protocol -
      and RUSHES back towards the bar. Viko stops her, grabs her...

      Kathy's eyes filling with tears she cannot cry -- Her heart
      breaking. Viko holds her tight, and pulls her away.

207   INT./EXT. UN VAN - NIGHT                                      207

      Kathy sits in total silence, her face white, staring ahead.

208   INT. BATHROOM - OASIS BAR - NIGHT                             208

      Raya crouches in a corner, stifling her sobs.

209   INT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               209

      Halyna pours water into a kettle. IN THE LIVING ROOM a TV
      shows footage of the GDA DOCUMENTARY:

      THE GDA logo spins. Footage of Halyna ON SCREEN:
                                                             TWB 95.


                          HALYNA (ON TV) (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                It took me very long time to realize
                there was name for this of
                trafficking...that there are big
                organizations like GDA who work for
                against this crime all these years.

      WE SEE FOOTAGE OF THE GDA OFFICE. The place is busy, the
      staff members look sharp and efficient. CLOSE ON: LAURA

210   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - UNHCR - SAME                    210

      Madeleine watches the same footage. CLOSE ON SCREEN: Laura.

                          LAURA LEVIN (ON SCREEN)
                With renewed funding support from USAID,
                the Global Displacement Agency continues
                to be the pioneering leader in
                international counter-trafficking.

      Milena sits by Madeleine. Both saddened realizing...

                          MILENA
                And our matching funds go to the GDA.

                          MADELEINE
                (shaking her head) The State Department
                money monster. Ironic, isn't it? That the
                very people whose money we need to fund a
                shelter to protect these girls, are the
                exact people they need protecting from.

      She turns up the TV, onto... HALYNA'S INTERVIEW...

      O.S. A KETTLE WHISTLES

211   INT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - SAME                                211

      Halyna puts tea leaves in a strainer. Listening to a TV in
      the adjoining living room. Where FOOTAGE OF THE GDA plays.

                          GIRLS VOICE #1 (O.S.) (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                ...My husband tell me, I will be gone one
                month. His friend arrange for me a job.
                But his friend bought me for two thousand
                dollars.

      Halyna pours water through the strainer.

                          GIRLS VOICE #2 (O.S.) (BROKEN ENGLISH)
                My sister arrange for my papers. Her
                boyfriend did this for 12 other girls...

      Halyna puts down the kettle. An ACADEMIC SPEAKS on TV...
                                                            TWB 96.


                          ACADEMIC
                More often than not, traffickers prey on
                those they know. Banking on the fact that
                a girl will trust them. Traffickers are
                fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles and
                aunts...

      Halyna's face whitens. It hits her...

212   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - DAY                        212

      Halyna glares at Zenia, who heaves tears.

                          ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
                I wanted to tell you--

      Halyna silences her with her hand. She walks around the
      apartment, taking it all in. The money is in the details. An
      LCD TV, DVD player. Halyna's hand traces over the things...

                          HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
                It's how you pay for this...

                          ZENIA
                Roman, he does... I'm--

      Halyna stiffens. An anger she thought impossible. She grabs a
      vase. She wants to throw it at Zenia, but at the last minute
      she throws it into a wall. Zenia falls as the vase SMASHES.

                          HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
                How. Could. You... Sell your own blood...
                tu xorobo... Where is she?

                          ZENIA (UKRAINIAN)
                I don't know.

                          HALYNA (UKRAINIAN)
                Where is she?! Where is she!? Whe--

      Roman walks in. Halyna lunges at him. He knocks her onto the
      ground. Zenia crawls to her sister. Roman steps between them.

                          ROMAN (UKRAINIAN)
                She is no longer your sister. Stay away
                from me! Stay away from her!

      Halyna spits in his face. He smacks her. She lifts her hand
      to punch him, but he grabs it and pushes her out the door.

      ON THE STREET

      Halyna bends over, heaving. She runs at the door, banging on
      it. PEDESTRIANS stare. A lunatic's rage in Halyna's eyes.
                                                            TWB 97.


213   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                213

      Kathy holds the phone. Her hands shake. Tears streaming.

                          ERIN (O.S.)
                Mom, what's wrong?

                          KATHY
                Erin?... No... Nothing's wrong. I just
                needed to... I needed to say I'm sorry...
                I'm sorry if you ever felt I wasn't there
                for you, but... I love you.

      Kathy can't keep it in anymore. She let's go and cries it all
      out, to the one person she wanted to be so strong for.

214   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                214

      Kathy stares at her computer... She presses NEW MESSAGE.

      CLOSE ON A BLANK EMAIL, THE "TO" LINE IS EMPTY.

      Kathy types. We see the following addresses: "UN CHIEF OF
      STAFF", "HIGH COMMISSIONER BOSNIA", "UN SECRETARY"...

      She continues typing. CLOSE ON THE SUBJECT LINE:

      DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH OR GUILTY CONSCIENCE

      Kathy pours her heart into the keyboard. As she types...

                          KATHY (V.O.)
                I am a police officer obligated to report
                crimes. I have taken statements from
                women describing their physical,
                psychological, and emotional torture...

215   INT. OASIS BAR - BACK ROOM - LATE NIGHT                       215

      The girls sleep. Raya lies awake crying.

                          KATHY (V.O.)
                ...On arriving in Bosnia these women are
                sold, and forced to provide sexual
                services...

216   EXT. BORDER STATION - NIGHT                                   216

      An IPTF VAN stops. The window rolls down: It's Mike Sears.

                          KATHY (V.O.)
                ...Their clientele consists of SFOR,
                IPTF, local police, and International
                employees. Worse, they have become
                involved in the trade itself.

217   EXT. HALYNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              217

      Halyna sits at an empty table. Her face gaunt from worry.

                          KATHY (V.O.)
                ...It is time each and every one of you
                realize this is a serious organized
                crime, with enormous profits.

218   INT. LOCAL POLICE STATION - NIGHT                            218

      The Oasis Barman dumps a STACK of DOLLARS on the counter.
      Fills out a form. Ivan Bladzic is released by a COP.

                          KATHY (V.O.)
                You are peace keepers who came to protect
                the innocent but now prey upon them in
                the worst ways possible...

219   INT. MARKET - NIGHT                                          219

      Lines of YOUNG GIRLS. A BUYER approaches one of them. She
      closes her eyes, too tired to fight.

                          KATHY
                It is time to face the truth of what is
                happening. We can right our wrongs, and
                move forward, ashamed, but accountable
                and transparent...

220   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               220

      Kathy finishes typing...

                          KATHY (V.O.)
                We may be accused of thinking with our
                hearts instead of our heads, but we will
                have our integrity.

      We pull back as she sits in front of the computer. Nothing
      but the screen illuminating her face...

221   INT. BACK BEDROOM - OASIS BAR - MORNING                      221

      The girls can't sleep. THE DOOR OPENS. Luba comes in, quickly
      closing the door behind her. She rushes to Raya.
                                                             TWB 99.


                          LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
                He's coming back in the morning. He's
                furious. Convinced you will talk.

      The other girls rally around, supportive. Raya shakes. Luba
      looks into her eyes, suddenly melting.

                          RAYA (UKRAINIAN)
                But I didn't say anything. I won't say
                anything. I didn't... (SOBBING)

      Luba holds her tight. Their friendship not buried after all.
      Luba unlocks a window, and gives her some money.

                          LUBA
                He's gonna kill you. Go! Go!

      Raya's eyes widen. Terrified. She jumps out into the unknown.

222   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - MORNING                              222

      Kathy buttons up her uniform. Logging into her email...

      MAILBOX FULL

      In the INBOX: EMAIL after EMAIL. All with the same subject:

      RE: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH OR GUILTY
      CONSCIENCE

223   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY       223

      Blakely, Rick and JOHN MORGAN, 50s, State Department, stands
      behind a FUMING Bill Hynes. He throws down Kathy's email.

                          BILL HYNES
                What is this?

                          KATHY
                An email I wrote.

      Bill suppresses his anger. He holds out his hand... Blakely
      hands him a document. Bill places it before Kathy.

                          BILL HYNES
                The actions I am taking are for your own
                benefit. We are seeking your repatriation
                back to the United States.

                          KATHY
                (stunned) You can't--

                          BILL HYNES
                I'm doing this for your own good.
                                                            TWB 100.


      Kathy eyes him, her gaze shifting to Morgan.

                          BILL HYNES (CONT'D)
                Right now, we are still willing to pay
                your way home. You need to sign this, to
                start your check-out procedure. You will
                be out of this mission by Sunday.

                          KATHY
                No.

      She leaves. Without signing anything.

224   INT./ EXT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - AFTERNOON               224

      THROUGH THE WINDOW: Kathy paces, nervous, telling all...
      Madeleine stands, resolved. Says something. Kathy nods,
      skeptical. Madeleine picks up the PHONE.

225   INT. BILL HYNES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                       225

      Madeline slams the door, having burst in. She stops. Squaring
      off with Bill. Two WARRIORS. Bill keeps calm...

                          BILL HYNES
                I'm starting to get a fucking headache.
                All your people do is gender...

                          MADELEINE
                Right. It is a core function of the
                Gender Office.

      He looks over, unimpressed.

                          MADELEINE (CONT'D)
                About the memo--

                          BILL HYNES
                The email? It seriously concerned me. The
                level of recklessness she used speaks
                volumes toward her mental state. This is
                for her own good.

                          MADELEINE
                Bullshit. You can't just fire her without
                cause. You need a reason that would stand
                up in court!

                          BILL HYNES
                She's burned out Madeleine!

                          MADELEINE
                She is not burned out, she's being
                burned!
                                                               TWB 101.


                             BILL HYNES
                   You hired her. You keep her under
                   control. You've always wanted to run this
                   your way. But I'm not going to let anyone
                   interfere with the way I run my mission!

                             MADELEINE
                   Then start running it with some
                   integrity! It's your people perpetrating
                   crimes against humanity!

      She goes to the door furious. But before she leaves...

                             BILL HYNES
                   Madeleine. Drop this. It's coming from
                   above my head.

      She stops.

                             MADELEINE
                   This is coming from Washington?

                             BILL HYNES
                   Yes. They want her out.

      Madeleine leaves. Focused. Something up her sleeve.

226   EXT. AMERICAN APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT                        226

      Sulpher lights. Kathy approaches the building. The American
      Flags hang from the windows. But it's quiet. Spookily quiet.
      Kathy moves quickly. Alert.

      Something moves -- Behind A CAR -- Flash of A MAN -- Kathy
      picks up her pace -- Eyes forward, but... The Man...

      Comes up behind her. Kathy flinches, as... he grabs her. She
      turns quick. Realizing... It's Franz.

                             FRANK
                   Let's go. Like nothing's wrong.

227   INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                         227

      Franz takes apart Kathy's phone. Removing... a small DEVICE.

      Kathy stares, alarmed. Franz looks around, frantic.
      Searching... The COMPUTER. He rushes over. Turns it on...

      ON SCREEN: A CURSOR FLASHES... Franz types...

      I HAVE FRIENDS IN BRITISH INTEL.
                                                            TWB 102.


      He points to the ceiling. Kathy eyes the walls... Lingering
      over each corner and crack. Franz grabs the keyboard...
      PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO YOU.

      Kathy watches the screen. Afraid.

228   EXT. DRIVE WAY - SARAJEVO - NIGHT                             228

      Franz lays talcum powder under a UN SUV.

229   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - NIGHT                                     229

      Franz' house is small, a bit messy. Kathy's on the phone...

                          KATHY
                He's powdering my car.

                                                       INTERCUT WITH:

      Jan shakes his head, horrified he's not there.

                           JAN
                The door handles too? Check thoroughly to
                see if there are any prints before you
                get in that car tomorrow. Kathy, are you
                listening?

      Kathy nods. Still grasping what's happening.

                          KATHY
                So you know how we talked about living
                together..? It may be a bit sooner than
                we planned.

      She offers a nervous laugh.

                          JAN
                Kathy, maybe it's time to come home.

      She hangs her head. Then... A KNOCK at the DOOR. Kathy turns.
      She puts down the phone. Inching forward... EYES ON THE DOOR.

      Reaching it, Kathy looks through the EYEHOLE... And exhales.
      She opens the door to... Madeleine Rees.

231   FRANZ'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 231

      Kathy listens, anxious as Madeleine lays it out...
                                                            TWB 103.


                          MADELEINE
                It's bollocks. Absolute and total. You
                have signed a contract with Dyncorp
                Aerospace Operations U.K... And there is
                no provision under English law for
                summary dismissal without due process or
                an investigation.

      Madeleine stops... seeing Kathy is overwhelmed.

                          MADELEINE (CONT'D)
                But there was something else Bill said...
                If this is coming from above... Kathy,you
                need to prove that they are dismissing
                you because you were uncovering wide-
                spread corruption within this mission. If
                you can prove that this is indeed coming
                from Washington, that the State
                Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire
                you. Then we're talking about a
                conspiracy.

                          KATHY
                They tell me... people disappear. They
                bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here,
                worried there's a bomb in my car--

                          MADELEINE
                We can fight this.

                           KATHY
                This isn't just my career, it's my life.
                I don't know if I'm ready to be a
                scapegoat.

                          MADELEINE
                That's exactly what you are.

                          KATHY
                Whose?

      She eyes Madeleine, pointed. Madeleine sits back.

                          MADELEINE
                I don't know what to say to that. Think
                about this. Let me know what you want to
                do. I'll support you either way.

232   EXT. MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - EARLY MORNING                     232

      An aerial glide over the mountains of Bosnia.
                                                              TWB 104.


233   INT. OASIS BAR - BACK BEDROOM - MORNING                       233

      The girls sleep in their cots, when... BAM! Ivan kicks open
      the door. He throws Raya in. On the ground. The girls wake.

      Ivan. He picks Raya up by the neck. She fights. Luba runs in.

                          RAYA (RUSSIAN)
                I didn't say anything. I never will. Why
                are you doing this? I just want to go
                home. I want to see... Mama... Mama...

      But he kicks Raya in the stomach. She ROARS in pain. He flips
      her over. Shaking her. He looks to the other girls. FURIOUS.

                          IVAN (RUSSIAN)
                This all happened because of you.

      He pulls out a gun. Raya looks to Luba for help. But it's too
      late. Ivan presses the gun to Raya's head.

      He glares into Raya's eyes. A flash of ire.

      Raya reaches again... Luba steps forward, when... BANG!!!!

217   Raya's body falls. Luba turns away. She cups her hand over    217
      her mouth. But a loud cry wails through...

234   EXT. MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - DAY                                 234

      The sound of Luba's scream fades over the morning. The wide
      horizon is calm. But a closer look reveals...

235   EXT. RIVER - MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - DAY                         235

      POLICE cordon off a RIVER BANK. Through an opening we see...

      Viko. Keeping local cops at bay. Behind him is... Kathy. In
      civilian clothes. Standing over a...

      DEAD BODY. Raya. Kathy stares, expressionless. Viko clears
      the cops out. Kathy turns, and retches. She pulls air into
      lungs, then straightens. She looks up to the trees, the apex
      of this leafy cathedral, as if invoking some higher power.

236   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - DAY                             236

      Kathy comes in. Madeleine looks up from a phone call.

                          KATHY
                What do I do?
                                                            TWB 105.


                          MADELEINE
                Hand in an appeal. Keep reporting to
                work. Watch how they respond. Build your
                case... And catch them in their lies.

237   INT. UNMHQ - DAY                                              237

      Kathy holds an envelope. Hynes' SECRETARY looks at Kathy.
      MUFFLED SCREAMING from his office. Kathy leaves the letter.

                          SECRETARY
                Ms. Bolkovac... I, me and the other
                secretaries... Your email was the bravest
                thing anyone's even done in this mission.

      Kathy nods, truly appreciating that. She walks away, her
      silhouette growing smaller and smaller down the hall.

      The secretary takes Kathy's letter. Walking into

      BILL HYNES' OFFICE

      Bill paces around Rick Jones, Ambassador Wells and John
      Morgan. Hynes grabs Kathy's letter.

                          MORGAN
                Get something on her! Get anything!

238   INT. PERSONNEL - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY                238

      Carmen listens to an anxious Kathy.

                          KATHY
                If you could just go into my office, I'll
                give you a key to the cabinets...

      But Carmen can't even meet Kathy's eye.

                          CARMEN
                Kath... my parents really need the money
                I send home. It's a lifesaver for them.
                My Dad has medical bills... I'm so sorry.

      Kathy nods, understanding but disappointed. She is alone.

239   INT. BOSNIAN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                           239

      Out of date, and under-stocked, the store is as spruce as a
      little post-war TLC could make it. Kathy stands at a counter,
      where a CLERK puts down a chunky PORTABLE CASSETTE RECORDER.

                          KATHY
                You don't have anything smaller?
                                                               TWB 106.


240   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - DAY                                         240

      Kathy paces. She holds a tape recorder to the phone.

                            KATHY
                  Yes, this is Kathy Bolkovac and--

                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

241   EXT. AIRSTRIP - SARAJEVO - CONTINUOUS                           241

      Ambassador Wells in ushered toward a UN PLANE. Into a PHONE:

                            AMBASSADOR WELLS
                  I can hardly hear you. Can you yell-

                            KATHY
                  OK. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

                            AMBASSADOR WELLS
                  YES. GO AHEAD.

                            KATHY
                  THIS IS KATHRYN BOLKOVAC. I WANTED TO
                  DISCUSS MY TERMINATION--

                            AMBASSADOR WELLS
                  THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE IPTF.

                            KATHY
                  OK. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS TOLD YOU MET
                  WITH MR. HYNES ABOUT ME.

                            AMBASSADOR WELLS
                  THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE! WHO TOLD YOU
                  THAT? I BARELY RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME. I
                  CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

      The PLANE ENGINES are roaring. Kathy can't hear him. She
      slams down the phone. Staring at the recorder. Thinking.

242   INT./EXT.   UN SUV/ UNMHQ PARKING LOT - DAY                     242

      Kathy, parked. Rips open a CASSETTE TAPE. She looks at her
      personage - this isn't fitting anywhere.

      RAIN hits the windshield. The glass becomes blurry in the
      haze of water. Kathy grabs a UN windbreaker from the back.
      Sticks the recorder in its pocket.

243   INT./EXT. LOBBY - UNMHQ - DAY                                   243

      Kathy flashes her UN ID. The guard eyes her. PASSERS-BY also.
                                                           TWB 107.


244   INT. HALLWAY - UNMHQ - DAY                                  244

      Kathy walks down the hall. Feeling it close in on her.
      Turning a corner, to...

      KATHY'S OFFICE

      Peter Ward stands in front. He can't look her in the eye.

      Kathy slips her hand into her pocket. Fumbling... Then looks
      up. She's got it. ECU of TAPE WHEELS turning. Kathy moves
      forward. Coming closer, she sees behind Peter...

      A NOTICE ON THE DOOR: GENDER OFFICE SHUT DOWN.

      Peter hands Kathy an envelope. Looking up... Apologetic. She
      reads, stunned.

                          KATHY
                Timesheet Violations? They are firing me
                for time sheet violations!!!

                          PETER WARD
                You should go.

                          KATHY
                I'm not going anywhere. Not without an
                investigation. Madeleine Rees is--

                          PETER WARD
                Hynes has sent a delegate to Vienna to
                have Madeleine Rees removed.

      Kathy is stopped short.

                          PETER WARD (CONT'D)
                State Department auditors are here.
                Asking for files on trafficking,
                prostitution and time sheets.

      Kathy stops. Realizing...

                          KATHY
                Can you repeat that?

      He looks around, nervous.

                          PETER WARD
                Look, this is between you and me, but
                Dyncorp and the State Department... you
                know it's a dual thing, and this is the
                action they have taken, whether right or
                wrong... I'm being told to do this.
                                                       TWB 108.


                    KATHY
          So you're saying the State Department is
          instructing Dyncorp to fire me.

Peter nods. And Kathy has what she needs.

                    KATHY (CONT'D)
          Please... can I just go in for one
          minute, get my personal belongings.

She eyes him. Knowing who he is inside. He shouldn't... But
Peter opens the door. Kathy goes in

KATHY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Closes the door behind her. Rushing   -- to the File Cabinet --
takes out her keys -- TO THE BOTTOM   DRAWER -- Kathy pushes
back FRONT FILES -- Takes FILES OUT   -- Looking around -- --
She grabs a GYM BAG -- STUFFS IN AS   MANY FILES AS SHE CAN.

She zips up the bag. Looks at the door. Still closed. She...

TAKES OUT HER TAPE RECORDER. Huddles down behind her desk...
PRESSES PLAY. But all she hears is FUZZ.

                    PETER WARD
          Kathy.

She turns. Peter stands over her. Eyeing the tape recorder.

                    PETER WARD (CONT'D)
          Scrambling devices.

She looks at him, waiting for his next move. His eyes soften.

                    PETER WARD (CONT'D)
          It probably won't work in most of the
          rooms. Now c'mon. Get out of here.

She smiles, silently thanking him. She shoves the recorder in
her pocket. Grabs the bag. Thrown by it's heaviness. Peter
helps her get it on her shoulder.

He ushers her out. Locking the door behind them. They move

DOWN THE HALL

When Rick Jones barrels after them. Waving Kathy's appeal.
IPTF OFFICERS come out of their office. Kathy rushes into

THE ELEVATOR

Quickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag.
An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns...
                                                            TWB 109.


      Again slipping her hand in her pocket. This time determined.

                          RICK JONES
                I'm gonna tell you this in front of him
                and everybody else, you no longer have a
                UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You
                do not have a job with the Department of
                State. The Department of State holds your
                contract. They are the ones who are
                pulling it. You will not have an appeal.
                You will not have a hearing. You will not
                have anything. Do you understand?

      Kathy lets the doors close without saying a word...

245   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - MISSION HEADQUARTERS - SAME           245

      The lights are off. The office sits untouched. Move over the
      bulletin board, still overflowing with faces of girls.

246   INT. HALLWAYS - UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT         246

      The halls. Quiet. Still. No sense of the noise to come...

                ...suspected UN involvement in

      BBC CHIMES. Bill Hynes talks to TIM SEBASTIAN.

                          BILL HYNES
                I can categorically state that not one
                United Nations Officer has been involved
                in the trafficking of a single woman.

                          TIM
                Are you saying that you believe all these
                victims' claims to be false?

                          BILL HYNES (O.S.)
                I don't want to make accusations about
                those girls. But I will assert over and
                over again, I run a ZERO TOLERANCE
                program for that type of activity...

248   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - DAY                                     248

      Kathy watches footage of Bill Hynes on BBC. She stares in
      disbelief. Then picks up... THE GYM BAG FULL OF FILES.
                                                            TWB 110.

      An IPTF SWAT TEAM bursts down the door of a bar. They move
      in, waving FLASHLIGHTS over GIRLS running in all directions.

250   INT. EDITING ROOM - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY             250

      ON A TV: Girls in silk robes. No sign of torture. They smile

      The screen PAUSES. AN EDITOR Turns to Rick Jones.

                          RICK JONES
                Any unused footage. Use it all. I want
                the press flooded with EPKs.

251   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - DAY                             251

      Madeleine speaks to REPORTERS.

                          REPORTER
                What do you say to rumors that Dyncorp
                are working to have you removed?

                          MADELEINE
                Try me... These raids are for show and
                completely amateurish. This is the
                biggest cover-up I have ever seen!

252   EXT. BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY                                  252

      Kathy moves through TOURISTS browsing for jewelry. Holding
      the gym bag tight. She turns a corner down a

      SIDE STREET

240   Narrow. TWO PEOPLE WIDE.. Keeping her eyes to the ground.     240

                          BILL HYNES (O.S.)
                We've had a UN inspection by senior
                investigators from New York. We've had
                inspectors from the State Department.

      John Morgan leads STATE DEPARTMENT AUDITORS into the lobby.

254   EXT. NARROW ALLEY - BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY                   254

      Kathy turns into a PIZZA SHOP. Flanked by AMERICAN FAMILIES.
      She walks, knowingly... into a BACK PATIO.

258   Small and dark. Kathy spots... A WOMAN in the back.           258
                                                            TWB 111.


255   EXT. BACK PATIO - PIZZA SHOP - BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY        255

      Kathy sits across from JOANNA PAUL SMITH. Eyeing her gym bag.

                          JOANNA PAUL SMITH (BRITISH ACCENT)
                I've been working at Human Rights Watch
                for fifteen years. We've been keeping
                close tabs on this. No one has come
                forward with anything solid before.

                          KATHY
                I have everything you need. When I arrive
                in Amsterdam safely, I will go on record.

      Joanna nods, a glimmer of admiration. Kathy stands, shakes
      her hand, and leaves... Disappearing into the crowd.

256   INT./EXT. CAR/ROAD - NIGHT                                    256

      Kathy drives alone. Checking the rearview mirror.

      A car pulls up behind her. It's bright light blinds Kathy.
      The car closes in on her. She winces, but... The car passes.

      It's just Kathy on the road. The gym bag on the seat beside
      her. The culmination of everything she's been fighting for.

      Her red tail lights disappear into a dark mountain tunnel.

      Fade up on:

257   EXT. COURTHOUSE - LONDON, ENGLAND - DAY                       257

      REPORTERS snap pictures of Kathy.

                          BBC REPORTER (O.S.)
                Expecting a verdict today. Two years ago,
                Ms. Bolkovac took her case against her
                employer, Dyncorp, to an industrial
                tribunal in Southampton, because the
                company is governed by UK employment law.

258   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                         258

259   EXT. INDEPENDANCE SQUARE - KYIV - DAY                         259

      Luba walks through a crowd. She stops at a fountain and looks
      around, nervous. Then she spots... Mara.

                          MARA (RUSSIAN)
                Ivan let you go. This is what you do now.

      Luba nods, understanding.

      BACK IN THE COURTROOM

      Karen squeezes Kathy's hand. Kathy looks to the back of the
      courtroom... Erin smiles at Kathy. So proud.

      JUDGE SWISS holds up Kathy's TAPE RECORDER...

      Kathy straightens. The Judge reads from a VERDICT. Karen's
      face lights up. Kathy's won. Jan breathes, relieved.

260   INT. COFFEE SHOP - KYIV - DAY                                 260

      Mara and Luba sit across from a YOUNG GIRL, 16. The girl
      excitedly flips through a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE...

                          YOUNG GIRL (UKRAINIAN)
                You both worked here?

      Mara looks at Luba, a 'do or die' look in her eye. Hiding her
      shame, she gathers her strength for this lie.

                          LUBA (UKRAINIAN)
                Yes. It will change your life.

      AND IN THE COURTROOM

      FLASHBULBS pop as Kathy stands... Pleased, but not elated.

      The Dyncorp team files out. As the judges stand, one of them
      eyes Kathy. And they connect. As only true lawmen do.

      But in this moment, the Judge, Kathy and us... We all know...
      She never wanted to win. She just wanted to do her job.

      FADE OUT.

265   INT. BBC HARDTALK - DAY                                        265

      We end this film with FOOTAGE of THE REAL KATHRYN BOLKOVAC in
      her BBC HARDTALK INTERVIEW with TIM SEBASTIAN. Show...

                             TIM SEBASTIAN
                   We talked to Bill Hynes, who was the
                   senior UN official in Bosnia at the time,
                   we talked to him a year ago, on this
                   program about some of your allegations.
                   He said they weren't true at all. He said
                   'We've had senior officials from New
                   York, we've had investigations from the
                   State Department... I can now
                   categorically say that not a single UN
                   official was involved in trafficking'.

                             KATHY
                   I think that Mr. Hynes knows this is a
                   false statement.

                             TIM SEBASTIAN
                   So you're accusing him of lying. That not
                   a single word he said is true.

                             KATHY
                   I watched that... Yes.

      Tim shifts. Kathy sits calm.

                             TIM SEBASTIAN
                   Would you do it again?

                             KATHY
                   Yes I would. No doubt about it... I would
                   definitely do it again. I'm not the type
                   of person who would... As a law
                   enforcement officer, I am held to a
                   higher standard.

      BLACKNESS.

1   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1

    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks
    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white
    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch
    over what was my left eye.

                        ME (V.O.)
              I'm old. And all I have left is the
              will to remember...

    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &
    white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below
    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of
    Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.

    The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              ...and the fear I'll forget...

    Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30
    years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              I killed innocent men. I betrayed
              sacred oaths. I reaped profit from
              horror. The names are dead or too
              guilty to tell. The events so
              brutal they beg to be re-told...

    Legend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958


2   INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - FIGHT NIGHT                         2

    The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab
    bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the
    `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice
              Division. LAPD. That's what my face
              looked like before.

    My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this
    bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD
    "JUNIOR" STEMMONS. Twenty-six.

                                                             2.



                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Junior Stemmons. A partner I never
              asked for. The scowl meant to hide
              a shit-scared kid who'd been
              teaching evidence classes three
              months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD
              lifer who never got past Sergeant.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              We should make our move now.

                        ME
              Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you
              wanna be at the center of a riot?

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              I don't wanna be here when Noonan
              and the Feds show up.

    I point at the bantam Black:

                        ME
              We let Sanderline finish this
              beating, we get his gratitude.                          *

    Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for
    `Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic
    smells when I stand this close to it.

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-

                        ME
              -relax Junior.


3   INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3

    The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double
    doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping
    jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight-
    taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big:

                        ME
              Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of
              the LAPD and a real big fan-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              -you're under arrest.

    Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees
    the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to
    Sanderline again:

                                                             3.



                        ME
              No you're not. Reuben is-

                        REUBEN RUIZ
              -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-

                        ME
              -for being a ranked fighter who
              still steals hubcaps. Shut up.
                  (off Ruiz, back to
                   Sanderline)
              If I was gonna arrest you, I
              wouldn't have let you finish: and
              that hook-uppercut combo you got is
              something special.
                  (from Reuben, beat)
              Reuben's in custody. But you could
              be our Guest. Whaddya say?


4   EXT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4

    Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit.
    Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes,
    hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer:

                        RING ANNOUNCER
              Ladies and Gentleman...due to
              circumstances beyond our control,
              Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-

    -BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer.
    Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three
    exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows-
    out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy
              League Crimefighter. Launching a
              big boxing probe as a way to begin
              prying into everything else crooked
              and corrupt in LA.

    Move faster.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Unaware the LAPD was walking away
              with his two big witnesses.

    As we near the side exit I stop. Junior pauses, less than a
    foot from my face, pointing up at Noonan, pure panic.

                                                             4.



                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE!

    My P.O.V.: second row, washed-up gangster Mickey Cohen with a
    Blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen
    before, but only in a yellowed B&W picture 30 years in the
    future. I can't take my eyes away...five seconds-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
              -HE SEES US!

    Noonan's gaze strafes us. I see him squint.

                        ME
              Then you can stop pointing at him.

    Double-time out the double-doors.


5   INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - NIGHT                                 5

    9th floor suite. All four of us. I order room service.

                        ME
              Hungry Sanderline?

    Sanderline digs the digs: sports the Ambassador robe over his
    street clothes, reading the Bible.

                        SANDERLINE JOHNSON
              If they got shrimp.

                        ME
                  (into the phone)
              Shrimp cocktail.
                  (over to Reuben)
              You want something Reuben?

                        REUBEN RUIZ
              To know why the fuck I'm here-

                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
              -mind your tone, Shitbird...

                        REUBEN RUIZ
              Shitbird went out with Vaudeville.
              You get your badge in a cereal box?

                        ME
              You're here because we want you to
              remember where you live.

                                                            5.



                    SANDERLINE
              (grade-school mind)
          City of Angels.

                    ME
          Excellent Sanderline.

                    REUBEN RUIZ
          What?

                    ME
          You live in LA, Asshole. You do not
          live in `Federal Government.'

Ruiz turns `caught-me' pink...I nod to Junior: split `em.
Playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          We get to spend time alone now.

                    REUBEN RUIZ
          Want some perfume?

Junior shoves Ruiz through the inner-door connecting the
rooms. Sanderline giggles. Close the door behind them. Sit
down inches from Sanderline, change my tone:

                    ME
          Stop laughing.

Instant quiet.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          What were you gonna tell Welles
          Noonan?
              (watch as he flinches)
          He has a subpoena with your name on
          it, Sanderline. Why would someone
          like you need to talk to the U.S.
          Attorney?

Sanderline staying silent...

                    ME (CONT'D)
          You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I
          know the Men that pay you for that
          will murder you if they hear you're
          about to talk to the U.S.-

                    SANDERLINE JOHNSON
          -but they don't know...

                                                         6.



                    ME
              (beat, small smile)
          And they don't have to. Now tell me
          what you were gonna tell Noonan-

-phone rings. Sanderline flinches for the second time.

                    SANDERLINE
          Bet you they ran outta shrimp.

I stand, step, answer it:

                    ME
          Yeah.

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
          The Spook with you?

Mild shock. Catalogue potential "who's"...

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (CONT'D)
          C'mon, we know he is. We're just
          trying to be mysterious-

                    ME
          -who's `we?'

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
          Me and Sam G.

                    ME (V.O.)
          G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors
          for the rest of my life.

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
          We're out at the place in Palm
          Springs. You should come out for
          the weekend.

                    ME
          Tell Sam if I get minute-

                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE
          -yer gonna have to make a minute
          for him. Now. See, we think the
          Spade might testify that Sam owns
          him and how we was grooming him for
          a title shot he was gonna tank. A
          fight everybody woulda' got flush
          off of, including the Spade.                        *
              (beat, quieter)
          Have him look out the window Klein.

                                                               7.



    Click. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the
    window...open it...then I chuckle genuine:

                        ME
              Sanderline, you gotta see this...

    Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window:

                          SANDERLINE JOHNSON
              What'm I-

    -smash his head against the frame using his forward motion.
    He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to
    pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask.

    Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel
    robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead
    streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway.

    Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside
    now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the
    door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where
    Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up...

                        ME
              DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?

    Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered.
    Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to
    me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper:

                        ME (CONT'D)
              Remember where you live.

    Reuben has to use both hands to steady himself.


6   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEY'S OFFICE - MORNING           6

    Spartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the
    mahogany table around which we sit. Outside: echoes of a
    protest filter through the windows:

                        MUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (O.C.)
              MEXICAN BROTHERS SI! IMPERIAL
              DODGERS NO!

    Four of us at the table glued to the T.V, watching U.S.
    Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD.

                        ME (V.O.)
              LA's version of the Young Turks,
              only meaner.
                        (MORE)

                                                8.

                    ME (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives.
          Smartest man in town. And one of
          the richest: Dad was a Real Estate
          Developer who owned a strip of land
          that's now known as the Santa
          Monica Freeway. On either side,
          Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob
          Gallaudet, not the smartest man in
          town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my
          notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune,
          running for a City Council seat
          that'll decide if this Mexican slum
          called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed
          and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              *

                    BRADLEY
          Turn it off.

Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.

                    ME
          I was pissing. He was jumping.

Bradley picks up a newspaper:

                    BRADLEY
          `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the
          Los Angeles Police Department in
          general, and Lt. David Klein in
          particular, of murder at worst,
          gross incompetence at best...'

                    ME
          Noonan had Sanderline scared. After
          he sang to me he panicked & jumped.

                    TOM BETHUNE
          He did spend a month in Camarillo
          Mental Hospital last year-

                    GAS CHAMBER BOB
          -and wearing that hotel robe over
          his clothes makes him look even
          more looney-bin.

                    TOM BETHUNE
          Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So
          Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's
          got nothing-

                    BRADLEY
          -but time, a mandate and new
          targets...I need to speak to the
          Lieutenant alone.

                                                         9.



Bob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles
lending support before Dad drops the hammer. Door closes. I
stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks
and placards: `BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS!

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)
          Describe to me your duty, as you
          understood it, regarding Sanderline
          Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.

                    ME
          Take both men into custody before
          Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   *
          out what they were going to tell-

                    BRADLEY
          -and why did I choose you for this?

                    ME
          Because I'm a Cop with a law
          degree, and you thought my legal-

                     BRADLEY
          -because your a thug with a law
          degree. Because I thought by now
          you'd be so indebted to this
          Department for not indicting and/or                   *
          imprisoning you, that diligent,
          honest discharge of duty would be
          assured.
              (beat)
          And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    *

                    ME
          Bethune and Gallaudet don't think
          so.

                    BRADLEY
          Bob's happy because he wants to be
          State Attorney General and his most
          likely opponent will be Welles
          Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton
          Diskant, who's leading their City
          Council race, is endorsed by
          Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing
          the larger play.
              (with calculated emphasis)
          Noonan's new target will likely be
          the LAPD itself.

                    ME
          How do you know that?

                                                        10.



                     BRADLEY
          Because that's where I would aim: a
          subpoenaed Federal witness plummets
          to his death in the company of two
          LAPD detectives?
              (beat)
          This screams Police Corruption.                      *
          This offers Noonan the possibility
          of payback in the form of national
          headlines.

I wave it all off:

                    ME
          Johnson did that stint at the Nut
          House -- leak his file to your
          friends at the times-

-and Bradley drops his bomb: Coroner's file. I stare...guess
the contents...try to keep my heart rate in-check...

                    BRADLEY
          My friends would be more interested
          in this.
              (beat, flipping file open)
          Coroner's preliminary: white paint
          chips found embedded in Sanderline
          Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on
          the white window sill. I checked
          with the hotel switchboard and
          found a call was patched to your
          room at about the same time Johnson
          flew out of it.
              (beat, proclamation:)
          It shocks and sickens me that your
          allegiance to the Chicago mob would
          take precedence over the LAPD.

                    ME
              (fuck drawing this out)
          Alright. Where's this going?                         *
              (pull my badge, table it)
          Gun? Shield? What?

                    BRADLEY
          The appearance of disciplinary
          measures taken against you are
          mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    *
          so your suspension will be recorded
          but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 *

                                                           11.



                    ME
          So if the papers or Noonan come
          sniffing around-

                    BRADLEY
          -we can provide adequate proof of
          your dismissal.

                    ME
          But you're not dismissing me.

                    BRADLEY
          Just on paper.
              (closes the file)
          Since I misjudged the Cop I thought
          you were, I'm going to leverage the
          Cop that you are.

Bradley slides the morning paper over. Front page: `Candidate
Diskant Hears The Hue and Cry of The Underclass...' The photo
shows a smiling Diskant, rolled shirt-sleeves, in the middle     *
of a sea of LA Immigrants, all smiling back.                     *

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)
          Morton Diskant is to be removed
          from the City Council race. The
          means and methods implemented to
          that end I will entrust to you.

                    ME
              (throw a thumb at Bethune)
          You want me to torpedo Diskant so
          your buddy Bethune can win a City                      *
          Council seat uncontested-

                    BRADLEY
          -or spend the next month in lock-up                    *
          before being arraigned on charges                      *
          of gross misconduct and dereliction                    *
          of duty. The preamble before you                       *
          face life in prison for murder.                        *

I stare back. Feel myself getting fitted for strings...

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)
          Diskant works Saturdays. Late.

Bradley waves me out. I intentionally drag my badge back
across the desk, scratching his Mahogany heirloom.               *

                                                            12.




7   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                                7

    Hollywood Hills loom in the distance.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Bradley's stooge now. A smart play
              suspending me: a built-in shield                        *
              for him if things go sideways.

    Traffic teeming up Fairfax, tourettes-like glances in my rear-
    view...a Black Buick...maybe mirroring my lane changes.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Black Buick...five Cars
              back...feels like a tail...

    Brake hard. They hang a left on Fountain.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              ...or maybe I just need sleep.

    Cruising up Nichols Canyon to the pad, cameras and
    copywriters loom on my front lawn.

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Press camped out post-Sanderline,
              looking for quotes to hang me with.                     *

    Slouch in the seat, accelerate, keep looking back...dig that
    geek from the Hearld pissing in my hedges.


8   EXT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - MORNING                               8

    Up the walkway.

                        ME (V.O.)
              Retreat to Meg's. My kid sister and
              only living family. Mom and Pop
              died in `51 when their first plane
              ride became their last.

    Scoop Meg's LA Herald of the ground. Headlines condemn me.
    Tuck it under my arm as Meg opens the door:

                        MEG
                  (glances from paper to me)
              I already got the Times inside.

                                                            13.




9   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER                         9

    Silver tea-pot over blue flame on olive-drab stove. The Times
    open on the table between us...Same shitty headlines.

                        MEG
              How much is true?

                        ME
              How many times have I lied to you?

                           MEG
              Zero.

    Shrug. Play aloof. Hope it suffices.

                        ME
              You've always liked your Men mean.

     She looks up at me. Feels the shame I shun...                    *

                        ME
              What would Mom and Dad say?

                        ME
              Nothing. That's where I learned it.

    She stands, goes to the stove.

                           MEG
              Poor you.

                        ME
              Yeah, pour me...a cup please.
              Black, no sugar.

    Meg stares darts. I smile to defuse.

                        ME (CONT'D)
              Pretty please.

    She fetches cups and saucers.

                        ME (CONT'D)
              How's work?                                             *

                           MEG
              It's work.

                        ME
              How's Pete?

                                                             14.



                            MEG
               More work.

     Quiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means
     creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes
     open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years.

     I drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you
     see the Hell I see when sleep wins:


10   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                          10

     Fire where the clouds should be -- POP -- in a backseat,
     point-blank Tommy-gunning two smiling men -- POP -- Marine
     fatigues soaked in blood, plunging my bayonet into a
     cheesecake-white belly -- POP -- that beautiful blonde from       *
     the Olympic, smiling -- POP-                                      *


11   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - SAME MOMENT                          11

     -awake. My leg jerks, kicks a big Wing-Tip. A cup of coffee
     pipes in front of me. Then voices. I turn: PETE BONDURANT has
     his hands on my sister's shoulders.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA
               Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead
               a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly
               impressed Howard Hughes hired him
               on as his full-time muscle. My
               Sister's new Hump. My oldest living
               Friend.

                         PETE
                   (turns back at me)
               You look like Death taking a shit.

     Meg cackles.

                         MEG
               He's still got that MGM-face.

                         PETE
               You're still the only guy who ever
               traded movie-potential for Police
               work.

                         MEG
               Because in the movies they make you
               pull your punches.

                                                             15.



     Drain my mug. To Pete:

                         ME
               Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?

                         MEG
               No. We're going to the Cocoanut-

     -Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips,
     which she bends backwards.

                         PETE
               'Favor' mean `free?'

                         ME
               Means $500 an hour.

                         MEG
               Gimme the phone so I can find
               another Date-

                          ME
               -you're the only Woman I know who
               calls Men-

                         MEG
               -you're the only Man I know who
               doesn't call Women.

     Pete laughs, then:                                             *

                         PETE
               What are we doing?


12   EXT. LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING, EAST LA - NIGHT            12

     Me and Junior in the car. Pete street-side, tucked into the
     shadows -- mimes jacking off, checks his watch. Everybody
     bored. Glance again at the file in my lap:

                          ME (V.O.)
               Morton Diskant, a man who preferred
               migrant workers to million dollar
               ballparks. Beating Bethune in their
               City Council Race despite getting
               outspent 10 to 1.
                   (beat)
               If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a
               Stadium, Mexicans get to keep
               raising chickens two miles from
               City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   *
               burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         *

                                                        16.



Junior in the backseat, penning in a steno, mouthing
something to himself.

                    ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Junior brought along because he
          begged. Already hip to how many
          ways you can make money with a
          badge.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          You got a birthday coming up.

                    ME
          What?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          On the 16th, right? How old?

                    ME
          Old. What are you writing?                          *

Head down, scribbling mid-sentence, makes me wait a beat.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Just notes...about work-

                    ME
          -what `work'?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Mostly compare and contrast stuff.
          Street work versus textbook-

                    ME
          -chapter 1: don't write shit down.
          Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 *
          you.

Junior's look practiced in a mirror: clicks the pen, slides
the steno away.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          So you think Noonan will come after
          you for the Sanderline thing? He
          seems like a real hard charger.

Bait him, see if he bites.

                    ME
              (the deadest deadpan)
          I heard he was coming after both of
          us.

                                                                17.



     Feature real concern from Junior.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               What?

                         ME
               Indictments. Prison time. Whole
               nine.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Holy Jesus. Is this true?

                         ME
               I'm seriously thinking about
               turning Junior...testifying against
               you.

     Junior goes sour...gets he's being goosed. I laugh, glance
     out the windshield: see Diskant finally exiting the office.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               Here we go.

     I start the car, slow-roll up the street. My Hamilton says
     11:04 PM. Streets deserted. Pete walking in Diskant's
     direction now as I continue to roll toward both. Pete close,
     dig his giant head nodding `hello.'

                         ME (V.O.)
               Seen Pete do this a dozen times and
               every time the same thought:

     Pete suddenly puts his back into an left hook: hammers
     Diskant from nowhere as they pass. Instant-ugly crumble.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               God help me if he ever hits me like
               that.

     Pete hoists Diskant by his waist-band, tosses him in the
     backseat. I accelerate out, obeying every law.

                                                       CUT TO:

     PITCH BLACK. Then a series of strobe-flashbulbs: maybe flesh,
     maybe two bodies, maybe both hairy/pale. Then groaning, then
     flickering fluorescent lights make it all look jaundiced.


13   INT. LOW RENT FUCK-TEL ROOM - SAME MOMENT                    13

     Lights now. Diskant awake, trying to loosen his jaw.

                                                          18.



                    ME (V.O.)
          Junior picked up this Quiff jocking
          other Fags in a Men's Room. But
          Quiff was a Law Student who wanted
          his record kept clean.

Quiff nervous but cooing, dick out, on Diskant's thigh.
Junior just as nervous...reloading a camera.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          He should suck his dick. Y'know?
          Put the icing on it.

A baffled moment as the comment registers.

                    PETE
          What?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Tell me that wouldn't sell
          it...plus he's a Communist.

                    ME
          We're ruining his career, not his
          soul. Reload the camera.

Diskant finally speaks: marble-mouthed. Pushes Quiff away:

                    MORTON DISKANT
          Off me!

Don't waste a second: grab Diskant by the hair, narrate his
immediate future.

                    ME
          Drop out of the City Council race
          or I send these pictures to the
          papers.

Diskant rips his head free. Rage. Blood from his mouth.         *
Scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:               *

                    MORTON DISKANT
          I'll fight you rotten-

                    ME
          -and maybe salvage something that's
          a close cousin to `respect.' But
          what about your wife and kid
          getting hold of those pictures?

                                                             19.



     Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting.
     Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw
     punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior:

                         ME (CONT'D)
               Take the Quiff home.

                         QUIFF
               My name's Franklin-

                         ME
               -of course it is.

     Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me,
     and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour...

                         ME (CONT'D)
               I need a nod from you Morton, let's
               me know you get it-

                         DISKANT
               -don't say my name...

                         PETE
               He gets it.

                         ME
               Someone from the Times will call
               for a quote. Whatever your reason
               for dropping out make it real.

     As Pete and I turn to leave:

                         DISKANT
                   (not looking at us)
               You eventually lose the ability to
               reconcile the things you've done to
               people. That's Hell.

     A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard.


14   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NEXT MOMENT                        14

     Pete driving. Silence. Tune to an all-night Jazz signal, turn
     up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts. Toss Pete his
     cut. A $500 roll.

                         PETE
                   (pocketing the money)
               Y'know Hughes has a job you're
               tailor-made for. I already gave him
               your-

                                                             20.



                         ME
               -no thanks.

                         PETE
               Stop pretending you're not a pig
               for all this, Klein.

                         ME
               I still got a day job, Pete-

                         PETE
               -tossing more Bantamweights out                       *
               windows?

     I wait too long, answer in too high a voice:

                         ME
               The Mutt jumped.

                          PETE
                   (laughs small, then:)
               Not even the people who don't know
               you believe that. If somebody from
               the DA's office decides to dig, you
               could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in
               with a billionaire who's got a
               fleet of planes, fly you outta the
               country on a moment's notice.
                   (beat)
               C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    *
               just wants you to burn some actress
               that stopped fucking him.

     Stop in front of Meg's place. Pete leaves the engine running,
     jumps out.

                         PETE (CONT'D)
               Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        *
               It'll be worth it.

     I watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A
     block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like
     they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I
     pass...but it just stays put...idling.


15   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - MOMENTS LATER             15

     Lights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen
     table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets.
     A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz.
     Sam G.' Exhale. Flip to the same jazz station. Sit. Start
     another futile fight with sleep.

                                                               21.


     The last thing I see before I nod black: my War Trophy, a
     Japanese Officer's Samurai Sword mounted on my mantle.

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


16   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                            16

     Artillery barrages from Hell: Okinawa, 1945. A hate-fueled
     frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off
     the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine.

     I dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already
     ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This
     guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize
     Sanderline Johnson: his pieced-together face smiling up. Snap
     awake. My phone ringing. 1 AM. Rip the phone from the wall:         *

                           ME (CONT'D)
               Klein-

                         BRADLEY (O.S.)
               -you know who Hector Magdalena is?

                         ME
                   (as cobwebs clear)
               ...yeah...Narco's Snitch.

                         BRADLEY (O.S.)
               He's missing. His home was broken
               into at some point within the last
               hour.

                         ME
               So send Robbery.

                         BRADLEY (O.C.)
               The only thing taken was him.
               Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get
               over there right now.

                           ME
               Why me?

                         BRADLEY
               Call it penance.

                         ME
               I thought that's what Morton
               Diskant was-

                         BRADLEY
               -that makes one of us. 1284 South                         *

                         BRADLEY (cont'd)
                   (edge to his voice)
               This kind of timing makes for
               disasters, Lieutenant.

     I hear the first split-second of Bradley smashing his phone
     down. Click my own cradle. Wipe my face. Dial another number.

                         ME
               Junior. Meet me at 1284 South                         *
               Tremaine. 20 minutes.


17   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - LATE NIGHT 17

     Police abound. Mostly work-a-day Blues pounding coffee. They
     part as I approach: Dave "Enforcer" Klein half-legend here. A
     plain-clothes breaks through, aims right at me: DAN WILHITE.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the
               LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan
               Catholic poisoned by 25 years in
               this desert. Recently divorced
               despite seven kids with his Ex.

                         WILHITE
               Why are you here?

                         ME
               You smell like bourbon Wilhite-

                         WILHITE
               -fuck off. This is handled. And
               pull your idiot partner out of
               there-

                         ME
               -Junior's already here-

                         WILHITE
               -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's
               my scene.

     -push past him, toward the house.

                         ME
               Then get Bradley on the horn, so
               you can relay that order. I'm here
               on his word. Now, what happened?

                         WILHITE
                   (dragged out of him)
               Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's
               missing.

                                      23.



          ME
And presumed what?

          WILHITE
I could give a shit. I just want to
this case to get a quick burial.

          ME
I'll bet. Who made the call?

          WILHITE
Some old broad heard an `argument'
and buzzed Wilshire Station.                *

          ME
Where's the family?

          WILHITE
The wife and daughter were in Santa
Barbara. Just got back.

          ME
    (check my Hamilton)
At 2 AM?                                    *

          WILHITE                           *
The Wife said she got into a fight          *
with her Parents, left ASAP.                *

          ME                                *
Why wasn't Hector with `em?                 *

          WILHITE
What do you think they were                 *
fighting about? Santa Barbara Wasps         *
don't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks.

          ME
What about the Son?                         *

          WILHITE
    (sneering hatred)
Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect.

          ME
Why's that?                                 *

          WILHITE
He's got a mean streak. And he and          *
Hector had been at each others
throats for months. Have Tommy              *
picked up. He likes to loaf at              *
those nigger jazz joints in Watts.          *

                                                             24.



                         ME
               Alright, you better cut out before                      *
               people start asking why the head of
               Narco is at a missing persons.

     Wilhite gets close, still sneering:

                         WILHITE
               Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and
               pin this thing fast or you'll have
               a whole division of disgraced cops
               at your front door.

                         ME
               What are you talking about Wilhite?

                         WILHITE
               You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe
               by killing that boxer   and they
               already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   *
               Bradley sent you down   here as
               damaged goods...think   about it.
               Everybody sees what's   coming.
                   (beat, closer)
               Now close this quick.

     Wilhite bolts. I pause. Clarity finally dissolving the            *
     bloodshot: this is the disaster Bradley was talking about:        *

                         ME (V.O.)
               The God-sized problems I triggered
               tossing Sanderline take shape: the
               LAPD's sanctioned dope-pusher
               vanishes -- that's a pretty juicy                       *
               spot to stick a new probe.                              *


18   INT. MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER                     18

     All money, no taste. In the foyer: a Wilshire Station six-
     pack interviews the old BIDDIE in a threadbare bathrobe. Dyed
     orange hair and a burnt-butter grin. Leans-lunges as she
     relays her story. I zoom in to catch the performance.

                         BIDDIE
                   (mid-sentence)
               -shifty...colored...y'know Negros
               are planning an invasion! After our
               white women and our water supply-

                         OFFICER
               -where was this Peeper you saw?

                                                        25.



                    BIDDIE
          Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   *
          there before! He's a black saboteur                   *
          looking for fertile white wombs.
          Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    *

-cut into the crazy:

                       ME
          Officer.

The Six-Pack crosses to confer.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          Besides bat-shit insanity, is there
          anything else about her that rings
          true?

                    OFFICER
          Heard an argument, loud, maybe a
          minute or two, then silence.

                    ME
          What's this `Peeper' riff she's on?

                    OFFICER
          She saw someone in the bushes
          earlier. She's reported that kind
          of thing a dozen other times. She's
          also reported flying saucers, so...

                    ME
          See if any of the other Neighbors
          can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       *

Roam. A hallway. Junior the grim-faced professional, He's got
that damn steno out, scribbling like he's on a deadline.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          No one touch a thing `til I say.

He's hovering over a lake of blood, drag marks originating in
that lake lead out to the garage. Junior sees me. See him
startle, then jut his tough-guy chin on reflex:

                       JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
          Dave-

                    ME
          -Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me'
          in twenty minutes' not `go in
          without me.'

                                                        26.



                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          All I've been doing-

                    ME
              (hard/harsh/low)
          -is stepping on dicks. You don't
          know the history, the players or
          the play.

Pull Junior aside, impart the following tightly:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          The Department gave Magdalena a                      *
          monopoly on the LA dope trade
          decades ago-

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          -what Department?

                    ME
          Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet-
          proofed him in exchange for 60% of
          his profit and a promise he only
          deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          -Black and Mexican-

                     ME
          -give the man a prize. He'd also                     *
          rat his competition and kill the
          ones we couldn't convict.
          Now keep your mouth shut and stay
          on my hip.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *
          Fine.                                                *

I want to bounce his head off the wall. I continue my tour
instead. Follow the blood-trail out into the garage where it   *
ends in another smaller lake of blood.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                   *
          Loaded him into a car-

                    ME
          -are all the Magdalena vehicles
          accounted for?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         *

                                                        27.



Continue the tour. Kitchen. Two Dobermans, shot dead. Feature
matching bullet wounds right between their eyes -- yell to      *
the Officer with the Biddie:                                    *

                     ME
          OFFICER.

As he pokes his head around the corner:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          The old lady hear dogs barking?                       *
          Gunshots?

                    OFFICER
          No, I asked. Just the yelling.

Examine the wounds closer. Catch myself petting the deceased
pooches. To Junior:

                    ME
          She didn't hear barking...so they
          were either lousy guard dogs...or
          they knew the Killer.
              (point to the wounds)
          You can't hit something this clean
          unless you're point blank. He
          could've been petting them when he
          fired: look at the burn pattern-                      *
              (point)
          Like when you shoot something with
          a silencer.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          How do you know that?

                    ME
              (stare so he gets it)
          I've shot things with silencers...
          And the old lady didn't hear any                      *
          gunshots.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          You make a family member for it?
          Tommy?

                     ME
          Maybe...                                              *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Do you want to issue an APB?

                                                             28.



                         ME
               I want to talk to Bradley first.
               Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   *


19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             19

     Feature this old Matriarch hanging by the thinnest thread:     *
     MADGE MAGDALENA, fifty-plus, dyed blonde bouffant pulled at
     and picked. Sad clown tears smearing too much mascara. She
     pitches a boo-hoo in between belts of wine to a bored stiff
     Wilshire Station six-pack.

     LUCILLE MAGDALENA, 20's: Daughter. Big bedroom eyes. A top
     two sizes too tight. Pops a palm of pills. Doesn't look too
     shattered about Daddy's demise. I make eye contact. I catch    *
     bruises on her arms. She sees me see, tries to cover           *
     nonchalant. The wall phone rings. Grab without asking.         *

                         ME
               It's Klein.

                         BRADLEY (O.S.)
               Update.

                         ME
               Hector's gone. Blood that may or
               may not be his leads out to the                      *
               garage. Two guard dogs shot dead
               but no other signs of a struggle.
               The house is intact.

                         BRADLEY
               Family?

                         ME
               Wife and Daughter are here.

                         BRADLEY
               Describe their state.

                         ME
               Mother Madge aggrieved.                              *
                   (aim my gaze at Lucille)
               Daughter Lucille...indifferent. The                  *
               son is persona non grata and a
               strong early suspect.

                         BRADLEY
               Alright, kick everyone out.
               Including all police personnel.

                                                             29.



                         ME
               How's that?

                         BRADLEY
               Don't question me. Is your partner
               on hand?

                         ME
               Yeah...                                               *

               and bring it to Wilshire Station.
               Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and
               take him into custody. No APB's,
               nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI
               to this situation.

                         ME
               You want me to-

                         BRADLEY

               line. I'll be at the Bethune event
               later on today. Find me there.

     Click. Second time he's hung up on me in an hour. Pull Junior
     to me just as he's going through a stack of mail:

                         ME
               I'm giving you on-scene command.                      *
               Bradley wants everyone removed from
               the premises and the entire house
               bagged for evidence and brought to
               Wilshire Station.
                   (more of a dare)
               Can you handle this?

     Big brown-nose nods from an aim-to-please Junior.

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Entirely. Where are you going?

                         ME
               To find Tommy Magdalena.


20   INT. CAR - EARLY MORNING                                  20

     Rolling up Hollywood to Highland.

                         KLEIN (V.O.)
               Big yawns. Half haze from no sleep.
               Buzz dispatch. A message from Pete.
               `Reminder: Hughes aircraft, 7 PM.                      *

     Glance street-side: Sanderline smiling blood in a wind blown
     bathrobe. Blink and he's gone, replaced by a kid hawking the
     Times.

     Pull-over. Toss the kid a coin. Front page: LEADING CANDIDATE
     BOWS FROM CITY COUNCIL RACE, next to a picture of Diskant.
     Pissed for reasons I won't name. Back to the Car. A Black
     Buick passes, slower than the rest of traffic, act like I'm
     oblivious. It turns. I slide in, start my Pontiac.

                          ME (V.O.)
               Another Black Buick. Call it a Fed                     *
               Tail. Noonan already up my ass.                        *

               Let's see if they got guts enough

21   EXT. DARKTOWN - DAWN                                        21

     Cruising the Crenshaw district, up through Central Ave.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Dispatch gave me Tommy's make and
               model: A `32 Ford Deuce with a bent
               eight. Hot-rodder Tommy liked to
               goose the cops into giving chase.

     Check my mirrors. That Black Buick hangs way back. Cruise
     past jazz clubs: The Savoy, Joe Morris's Plantation, Shepp's
     Playhouse, the Down Beat...no sign of a Ford Deuce. Pull up
     to the Club Alabam. Valets stare: a white man in Watts at
     this hour can only be Cop. Park.                                 *

     Half-a-block back: buzzcuts in that black Buick.

               Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces                       *
               glow like Martians this far down

Almost 6 AM and the club is still half full.

Press on, scan the stage: A Bebop trio toils over an Erroll
Garner tune as a beautiful black girl sings in a satin soft
lilt. This whispering falsetto that makes your hair stand on
end. I stop and listen. Get my only smile of the day from       *
her. Smile back because her voice reminds me to.

Hear beer bottles rattle behind and break. Turn. Squeeze that
smile into a sneer, stare down this massive BARTENDER.          *

                    ME
              (flop badge on bar)
          Get Lester and get me a scotch                        *
          straight.                                             *

The bartender glowers, grabs a bottle, pours, hands the size    *
of catcher's mitts. He slides the glass. I sip.                 *

                    BARTENDER
          Sanderline Johnson was my second                      *
          cousin, Peckerwood. I wouldn't                        *
          drink that with my gun hand.

He vanishes behind a stained curtain. Feel those voodoo         *
stares from behind...and I switch the scotch glass to my left   *
hand as nonchalant as possible. Bartender reappears, motions
me back. I follow. Backstage. I see a figure stretched prone,
ice-pack pressed to his face, rolled reefer between his lips.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced
          crooner. But a dabble in the dope
          trade cost him a set of slashed
          vocal cords at the hands of none                      *
          other than Hector Magdalena.                          *

Only as I get closer do I see the badly swollen black eye. He
looks up at me. A voice like sand-paper left out in the sun:    *

                    LESTER LAKE
          Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of                      *
          Sanderline Johnson...y'got stones                     *
          showing up this far South.                            *

                    ME
          What happened to your face?

                     LESTER LAKE
              (beat)
          Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I
          understood something he was saying.

                                                        32.



                    ME
          Where is he?

                    LESTER LAKE
          Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe.

                    ME
          Shit. He's wise.

                    LESTER LAKE
          To what? You looking for him?

Lester hands me the reefer, take it, toke geeky, belch smoke.

                    ME
              (at the reefer)
          Just never got this...

Lester takes it back, draws deep.

                    LESTER LAKE
          Too white to appreciate good grass.                   *

Now watch Lester's attitude improve toot sweet:

                    ME
          Hector Magdalena is missing,
          presumed dead. Tommy is our sole
          suspect.

He spurts smoke, sits up like a shot, beams.                    *

                    LESTER LAKE
          Muthafucker -- there is a God.
          If only I'd known this an hour ago.

                    ME
          Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig
          here last night?

                    LESTER LAKE
          I don't let him, he just does.
          Nails on a chalkboard too. He
          rushed the stage last week when we
          had Charlie Mingus drop in for a
          set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   *
          greaser kid trying to play `Round                     *
          Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    *
          find them keys with a flashlight.'

                    ME
          Tommy's playing days are over.

                                      33.



          LESTER LAKE
Hallelujah.

          ME
What time did he show up?

          LESTER LAKE
Around four. Him and these Pachucos         *
poppin' switchblades like punks.
    (mops his brow of blood)
The only thing that was keepin' him         *
`untouched' was Hector...                   *
    (beat, hopeful-prayer)
Is he really dead?                          *

          ME
There's blood all over his house,
seems to belong to him. There's
just no body. Not yet.

          LESTER LAKE
    (a toke, a thought)
I don't feature Tommy for it.               *

          ME
    (my head kinks a bit)                   *
How's that? How many times has he           *
been in here, busted you up?

          LESTER LAKE
Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             *
to truly take a Man's life.                 *
Especially not Hector's...he was            *
scared of him.                              *

          ME                                *
Why?                                        *

          LESTER LAKE                       *
`Cuz Hector been whippin' Tommy's           *
ass from the time he could talk.            *

          ME                                *
What about the Wife? Beat her too?          *

          LESTER LAKE                       *
We used to call that old bitch `the         *
Burglar'...eyes were so black, it           *
looked like she had a mask on.              *

          ME                                *
And the daughter? Lucille?                  *

                                                        34.

23   EXT. UNION STATION BALLROOM - DAY                            23

     Bethune Campaign Fundraiser turned Victory Bash. Big smiles
     beam above sunburned double-chins. Bethune the nucleus of a
     Press circle-jerk. I weave around, lack of sleep and a
     miserably wrinkled suit make me look like something dug up.

                         REPORTER #1
               Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant
               dropping out the only way you could
               have won this race?

                         TOM BETHUNE
               Not at all. My message of civic
               advancement manifested in that
               beautiful blue baseball team was
               starting to hit home.

     Bethune's beam twitches when he sees me weaving past. Give
     him a quick nod, get nothing back: he can't be seen this
     close to the turd in the punch bowl. Moving by:

                         REPORTER #3
               Anything you'd like to say to
               future constituents?

               I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard
               and relish!

     Bradley at one of the front tables confabbing with DA Gas
     Chamber Bob Gallaudet. As I aim their way, one of my favorite     *
     men aims at me, wearing this Great White grin: FRITZ KOENIG.

                         ME (V.O.)

          These functions aren't normally               *

                    KOENIG
          I wouldn't have expected so public
          a showing after Sanderline Johnson.

                    ME
          He jumped Fritz.

Koenig flashes that grin again.

                    KOENIG
          I'm sure he did. And where is your
          young partner this day?

                    ME
          Working his first big job.

                    KOENIG
          Might the job involve the LAPD's
          most important missing Wetback,
          Hector Magdalena?

My eyes narrow but stay smiling:

                     ME
          It does.

Koenig nods, casts his gaze out over the crowd.

                    KOENIG
          I've known Stemmons since the
          academy. He was a top pupil. A                *
          peculiar little pain in the ass,
          but very good with details.

                                                        37.



                     ME
          Kid might have some climb in him.
               (look back at Bradley)
          Reminds me of another pain in the
          ass.

Koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his.

                    KOENIG
          I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley
          would assign you to the Magdalena                     *
          case when you're neither Homicide
          nor Robbery...

                    ME
          There's no body, and nothing was
          taken except Hector.

                    KOENIG
          He does know how to delegate
          doesn't he...and also I'm sure that
          poor Negro's nosedive has put you
          squarely in his debt.

                    ME
          Something like that.                                  *

                    KOENIG
          Keep me abreast will you? Chief
          Parker is understandably nervous.
          Situations like these tend to yield
          grief...and we've the FBI poking                      *
          around our garden patch.                              *

                    ME
          My ass first Fritz, yours second.

Koenig's big laugh again. Moving toward Bradley now. Then
flashbulbs pop-blind. Panic: snapping pix of me? Relief: not
me. Hollywood types: this Buff McMan Meat-type and Her. I go
slack inches from the Press that yesterday wanted to roll in
my guts...but now they're just as entranced with her as I am.

She and McMan Meat continue past as I stare, she answers his
questions for him. I think her eyes see mine. Then I realize
where I'm standing. Bradley waiting. Focused on me and not
her -- God-damned Eunuch. I step over, speak without preface:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground
          and he's got a war chest to keep
          him there. The only way we take him
          quickly is to issue a citywide APB-

                                      38.



          BRADLEY
-no. We can't risk that. Do you             *
make him for the murderer?

          ME
Yeah. Hector's disappearance is
definitely an inside job. That
whole family feels hinky. The
daughter was all bruises and no
tears and Hector's hop-head wife            *
looks part punching bag.

          BRADLEY
Do you suspect either of the women?         *

          ME
According to Wilhite, they were in
Santa Barbara at the time.

          BRADLEY
Verify that. Where is your partner?

          ME
Vouching in evidence at Wilshire
Station.

           BRADLEY
Keep him on that. He had excellent
ratings as an evidence teacher and          *

Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus
everything on that effort & I want
him apprehended Klein, not killed.

What about Hector? Still missing.

          Wilhite. He was operating Hector-

                    BRADLEY
          -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You
          deal directly with me. Now go out
          the back. I don't want the press
          recognizing you.

Swallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard.
Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an
alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get
to examine up close. I stop, stammer, she gives me a once-
over, thinks I'm a Reporter...

                    ME
          You got a light?

                    WOMAN
              (searches my empty hands)
          You got a cigarette?

I fumble for a Chesterfield. She pulls a Zippo slow.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          If you snap a picture of me, I get
          to set you on fire. Fair?

I smile too wide -- fuck. I kill it, try to gather up the
bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile.

                    ME
          It didn't look like you were all
          that upset with the attention.

                    WOMAN
          Good thing you're not a cop.

     Lights my cigarette. I hold it in my mouth to hide shaking
     hands.

                            ME
               Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Don't thank me: these things are
               bad for you.

                         ME
               You believe everything you read?

     Stubs her cigarette.

                         WOMAN
               You believe anything you read?

     She starts walking back the way I came.

                            WOMAN
               No.

     I can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through
     the double doors, re-entering the fray head-first. I step
     after her. A reporter finally makes me. Random catcalls of
     `Klein! `Hey, Enforcer!' Shutterbugs beeline my way, firing
     flashbulbs from the hip. Close the door quick and bolt.

24   INT. WILSHIRE STATION - DAY                                  24

     Stroll. Sidelong stares on the periphery. Muted whispers from     *
     desk cops. Feature this rookie chump clear a path as I pass.      *
     Down a flight of stairs to the evidence lockers. Junior

Everything worthwhile.

          ME
What did you tell the Watch
Commander upstairs?

          JUNIOR STEMMONS
    (schoolboy proud)
That this was a random drug
seizure. I'm not using names and
I'm number coding everything.
A load of interesting stuff too.
    (points to each stack)
I got unregistered fire-arms, more
dope than I've ever seen, and some
mail from business associates that
seems hinky. We should follow up-           *
    (grabs an envelope)                     *
-here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings'         *
Hector had some real estate
dealings-

-bag it until Bradley orders us
otherwise.

How do you solve a case when the
evidence is in bags?

You don't. Our job is to find
Tommy.

And why is that out?

          JUNIOR STEMMONS

I'm making notes separate from-

-I thought we were investigating
Magdalena's disappearance-

bottom of the screen?                       *

               And there's reasons. Respect them.                      *

     Junior tucks the steno away, chastened.

                          ME (CONT'D)                                  *

               the house and revolving tails on
               both Madge and Lucille Magdalena.
               Their alibi is they were in Santa
               Barbara when Hector vanished. Find
               out if that's real. The tails and

               Can you manage this?

     Junior jacks his chin just high enough to save face, tucks

          Please.

We sit at a huge drafting table. I shoot a sidelong to Pete.

          Where's Mr. Hughes?

                    MILTEER
          Unavailable. Unfortunately. But
          I've been given full authority to-

                    ME
          -I'm not contagious...if that's
          what he's worried about.

Pete hate scowls me: have your fun, Asshole...

                    MILTEER
          I don't find that the least bit
          humorous Lt. Klein.

                    ME
          Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr.                      *
          Milteer?

Milteer looks at Pete. Pete half-shrugs. Back to me now:

                                                44.



                    MILTEER
          An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe
          signed a Service Contract that
          she's now willfully violating by
          acting in a Z-grade horror picture
          presently `shooting' in Griffith
          Park. Despite entreaties for her to
          cease participation in this
          absurdity, she continues to revel
          in her outlaw status with us. Thus
          we would like her destroyed.

                    ME
          What makes you think I can do a
          better job than your people?

                    MILTEER
          Mr. Bondurant says you're one of
          the smarter people he knows-

                     ME
          -dubious honor if you knew the
          other people Pete knows.
              (beat)
          So you want to catch her in
          violation of her Service Contract?
          Something like that?

                    MILTEER
          Exactly. The morality clause in
          particular as the damage to her
          reputation would be most
          devastating: Nymphomaniac,
          Criminal, Communist...anything
          along these lines. Once you visit
          the set of her `Attack of the
          Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the
          void that is her character. We
          haven't a photograph handy, but
          she's playing the lead female role.         *

                    ME
          I'm happy to help. But my price is
          $10,000. Not 5.

Pete laughs out loud. Milteer goes frigid.

                    MILTEER
          $10,000 should buy more than help.

                                                             45.



                         ME
               For 10 give it any name you want.
               I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      *
               that means I'll have to find time
               off hours to do this.

     A long, cold moment drags...                                    *

                         MILTEER
               Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      *
               been stealing groceries from our
               talent domiciles. There's no proof
               that it's her, but it's her. Peter
               will provide you addresses.

                         ME
                   (faux fey)
               Thank you Peter.

                         MILTEER

     Two-fisting coffees. On top of a hill overlooking the `Atomic
     Vampires' shoot. Pure schlock. The spaceship: a totaled
     Cadillac replete with home-made canopy and cardboard
     extensions on the fins. Crew: homeless winos. Extras:
     homeless drug-fiends. Scan the assembled `talent'...and see:

     HER. My black and white picture. The Beauty at the fight. The

29   EXT. ATOMIC VAMPIRE SET - DUSK                               29

     Walk past a pair of beat Airstream Clippers. Watch her
     propping up this silver-haired junkie. She grabs a sound
     blanket, drapes him, hands him her coffee before siting down
     next to another Woman and rehearsing.

     I eyeball the rest of the `set.' Winos in werewolf masks and
     capes, holding wooden ray-guns spray-painted silver: One
     pisses, bottle in one hand, cigarette/dick in the other.

     The "Director" is a fey manic, fingering a snuff-box.

                    ME
          What else are you hearing?

                    MICKEY COHEN
          That this Welles Noonan character
          has developed quite a crush. That
          you might want to consider
          relocating to Dogdick, Delaware.

                    ME
          Been a marked man for years Mick.

                    MICKEY COHEN
          But the bullseye on your back's
          never been quite so big...if you
          need a new line of work, I got this
          faygele leading man needs replacing-

-follow Mickey's gaze over to ROCK ROCKWELL. Buff McMan Meat-   *
the guy with Glenda at the Bethune party. He's primping with    *
other boys decked in surplus SS uniforms, checking the side     *
mirror of one of the `Alien craft' before his big close-up.     *

                    MICKEY COHEN
          His agent told me he could play
          straight.

                    ME                                          *
          His agent lied.                                       *

                    MICKEY COHEN                                *
          You interested?                                       *

                    ME
          No. But I am interested in your                       *
          leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw                    *
          her at the Bethune-

                                                             48.



                         MICKEY COHEN
               -not a chance. I'm still trying to
               play hide the submarine.

                         ME
               You want Chief Bradley angry?

                          MICKEY COHEN
               Ten years ago I could call for that                   *
               little Pisher's head on a stick.
                   (looks around)
               And now...

                         ME
               And now the only thing you're
               putting on sticks are corn dogs.
               What's her name, Mick?

                         MICKEY COHEN
               Glenda.

                         ME
                   (still looking for HER)                           *
               Why was she there?

                         MICKEY COHEN
               Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda
               and Rock to any event where there's
               cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'-
               honor treatment everywhere with
               that shape a' her's...

                         ME
               What she drive?


30   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              30

     Following the tail-lights of a 56 Corvette. Top-down,
     whipping Blond hair split-second visible under passing street
     lights. Glenda pulls into what I guess is her place: tiny-
     tidy Glendale flat. I roll past: no eye contact.

     Around the block. Park on the next street over. Waiting until
     I think of what comes next...get out now...


31   EXT. GLENDALE - NEXT MOMENT                               31

     Up to a fence. Scratch it: make sure a nuts-hungry Pooch
     isn't slobbering on the other side. Nothing. Vault the fence.
     Dodge a pool. Over another fence and into-

                                                             49.




32   EXT. GLENDA'S BACKYARD - NEXT MOMENT                      32

     -creep to a window: curtains pulled. Creep to another: there
     she is. Watch her: elegant fingers emanate from hands only
     now beginning to betray age. Watch her shake her sandals off.
     Arranging three coffee cups on a tray: company coming.

     On cue: another car. A `53 Cadillac: the Director and Rock
     Rockwell. I crane my neck to get as much of her as I can. She
     leaves the tray, cups steaming. Muffled greetings. Check the
     window, open. Slide it up gentle.


33   INT. TINY LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENT                       33

     Glenda clearing seats.

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Coffee's in the kitchen. Let's go
               over this quick because I'm beat.

                         DIRECTOR
               We're set on a place where we can
               stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga
               Canyon, two weeks-

                         ROCKWELL
                   (petulant)
               -two weeks? My body'll fall apart-

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               -think of it as 14 days of push-ups-
                   (to the Director)
               Are you sure about this Sid? Seems
               shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?

                         DIRECTOR
               And I think it's brilliant!
               Inspired! The two leads of Mickey
               Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped!
               The press'll eat it up! They'll
               write about `Gangster Mickey,' the
               glory days. Couple a' headlines
               like that and interest in Atomic
               Vampires will go through the roof!
                   (to Glenda)
               Who's gonna grab you?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               A charmer I knew in another
               life...George Ainge.

                                                             50.



     Pat myself down for a pen, scribble on my hand: "A-I-N-G-E"

                         SID FRIZELL
               Is he okay with making it look real-

                         ROCKWELL
               -he can't hit me in the face!                         *
               That's a deal-breaker!

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               He'll be thrilled to knock me
               around. Plus he's holding something
               of mine, so we can kill two birds.
               He'll grab us Tuesday in front of
               the Pacific Dining Car.                               *

                         ROCKWELL
               What about Hughes?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               What about him? That angle can only
               help us.

                         SID FRIZELL
               I'm dying to know...was he the
               Spruce Goose between the sheets?


34   EXT. GLENDA'S BACKYARD - SAME MOMENT                      34

     My face folds up -- jealous-sour frown. I reach in, steal one   *
     of the steaming cups, bolt. Audible as I retreat:

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE (O.C.)
               Hung like a newborn and he called
               my tits `propellers.'

     Belly laughter from inside.

                         ME (V.O.)
               The real howler: fake kidnappings
               always bomb.


35   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              35

     Parked. Tepid pulls off the stolen mug. Done. Toss it to the    *
     passenger side: lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam. Look
     up: the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down. Glance at
     the passenger seat: an envelope lined with fifty $100 bills.
     The name: BLEDSOE written across the front. Pick it up.

                                                             51.



                         ME (V.O.)
               Thinking I could tip Milteer off to
               the kidnap plot and pick up the
               other half of my payment...
                   (stare at that money)
               Thinking I should just give the
               first half back now...'cuz I know
               right now I'll never hurt her.

     Toss the envelope into the glove-box, slam it shut. Scan. Two
     heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars I ordered. Cursory
     nods as they pass. Tail-lights fade. Dead quiet save my low
     Jazz. Fighting my drift. Check my Hamilton. 10:00. Grimace.       *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               No sense of time. Exhaustion steals
               it. A full hour earlier than I told                     *
               Junior to meet me. I need sleep.                        *

     Yawn. Look up...Lucille Magdalena at her window. Sudden.          *
     Startling: no blouse, pig-tails, big silver-dollar nipples
     touch/steam glass. Pushes the curtains back even further.
     Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid: wide awake now.

     I see her eyes aren't sex-placid or rolled back -- they're
     scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back.      *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            *
               This routine had been done before.
               That old broad babbling about a
               Peeper. The only other link to
               Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       *

     She holds her scan for a blink, a different smile, eyes sex-
     placid now, rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was
     looking for: hidden eyes staring back at her. I look to where
     I saw her gaze kink...unholster my .45. Get out quiet.


36   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT               36

     Cold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg.
     Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet
     steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter...

     Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm
     shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my
     head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       *
     blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning:

                         ME
               STOP-

                                                         52.



Still unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of
gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting
away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   *
finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     *
left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim:

POP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight:
a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the
block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      *
Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running.

I sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail,
panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the
Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard.
Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street-

-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    *
look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel.
I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands
pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm
swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    *

Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick.
Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to
write home about. My gun clatters to the ground.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          That's for Sanderline Johnson.

                    ME
              (nod at the Peeper trail)
          ARE YOU BLIND-

                    WELLES NOONAN
          -what were you firing at?

                    ME
          The only lead on Magdalena -- we're
          after the same guy you idiot!

                    WELLES NOONAN
              (to one of the goons)
          -write that name down: `Magda-LEE-
          na' or `Magda-LAY-na.'
              (back to me)
          No, we were after you. But thanks
          for the name.

Sag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity.          *

                                                               53.



                          ME (V.O.)
               Assumed the Feds were smart.
               Assumed they were ready to stick a
               new probe into the LAPD's deal with
               Hector, like Bradley warned, like
               everyone feared. But they had no                        *
               clue and I just handed them the
               whole God damn thing.
                   (beat)
               Like I said: I need sleep...

     Raise my face now, eyes intent, chin out.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               First punch you ever thrown Noonan?
               Your Mom have to teach you how
               because Dad was the same no-chin,
               Connecticut Faggot you are?

     Noonan stops, turns back to me: blazing.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I think I hit the Noonan family
               dynamic, dead-on.

     He winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           *
     darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn.

     FLUTTERING BLACK:

                           WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)
               Drop him.

                         DERBY #1 (O.C.)
               You don't want to take him in?

                         WELLES NOONAN (O.C.)
               I only want to bring him in when I
               know he'll never leave.

     BLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER, then:


37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN                       37

     Horizontal. Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one
     side: space for the cot I'm on. Look up. Junior looking
     down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough. In his undershirt. He
     slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. Sit up. A
     balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped.

     Gaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig
     walks in, silver pitcher in hand. I gape up, still punchy.

                                                        54.



                    ME
          Coffee?

                    KOENIG
          Ice. Bradley's on his way down.

Toss the dress shirt to the floor.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          That's mine...you needed some                        *
          mopping up.

                    ME
          Who found me?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          I did. I got there at eleven like
          you said, right as two black &
          white's pulled up: you were out                      *
          cold in a gutter `round the block.                   *
              (this blithe little grin)
          Did Noonan knock you out?

                    ME
          He hit me with his car first.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
              (a nod to Koenig)
          The Captain was the only one here
          at this hour...                                      *

Look from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him --
Bradley steam-rolling our way. To Koenig, conspiratorial:      *

                    KLEIN
          If I need your help later on, can I
          count on it?

                    KOENIG
          Of course you can.

Take the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the
cold cuts cobwebs. Bradley walks in, imperious. Koenig moves
past -- ice forms between the two.                             *

                    KOENIG (CONT'D)
          Chief.

                    BRADLEY
          What are you doing here?

                    KOENIG
          The Lieutenant was thirsty.

                                                           55.



Koenig closes the door. I refuse to look up at Bradley.

                    BRADLEY
          Progress on Magdalena.

I point to Junior -- happy to play teacher's pet:                *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          No fingerprints. Clean crime scene.
          Canvassed the neighborhood. A
          senile neighbor did report a
          possible Peeper-

-rubbing the back of my head where the Peeper bashed me-

                    ME
          -confirmed Peeper.

Bradley turns to me:

                    BRADLEY
          Is that who knocked you out?

                    ME
          Noonan knocked me out.

                     BRADLEY
              (beat)
          He's having you tailed then...

                    ME
          And he knows the Magdalena name and
          that I was chasing a suspect -- the                    *
          Peeper Lucille strips for.                             *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          She knows someone watches?

                    ME
          And who he is. She has to.
              (back to Bradley)
          I want access to her juvie sheet or                    *
          whatever arrest records exist.                         *
          Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     *
          dealers he did business with.                          *

                    BRADLEY
          That's immaterial.                                     *

                     ME                                          *
              (as my teeth grit)                                 *
          It is if you're eliminating her as                     *
          a suspect-                                             *

                                                        56.



                    BRADLEY                                    *
          -did you confirm their alibi?                        *

Point to the ever-studious Junior.                             *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *
          I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston                  *
          Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   *
          of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      *
          they've confirmed their visit and                    *
          also corroborated the argument that                  *
          resulted in them leaving early.                      *

                    BRADLEY                                    *
              (back to me now)                                 *
          One alteration to my previous
          orders-

                    ME                                         *
          -previous orders being what? Assign
          the Cop Noonan blames for his dead
          boxing probe to the case that's
          becoming his new crusade?                            *

Bradley conjures the Roman visage...then slowly opens the      *
door, staring holes in me.                                     *

                    BRADLEY                                    *
          Step out Stemmons.                                   *

Junior balks, looks my way: tries to mimic my sneer. I stand   *
and shove him toward the door. His look back at me: Judas.     *
Bradley closes the door behind him.                            *

                    BRADLEY (CONT'D)                           *
          No direct approach on the mother or                  *
          the daughter.                                        *

                    ME
          No. Madge was a battered wife and                    *
          Lucille was a suborned whore. If                     *
          that's not motive, what is? You                      *
          want answers then we brace those                     *
          two hard.

                    BRADLEY                                    *
          If you do so directly, if they're                    *
          formally questioned then Noonan may                  *
          find out and go after them with
          Federal warrants.

                                                    57.



                    ME
          Noonan will figure out who and what
          Hector was sooner or later.                     *

                    BRADLEY                               *
          Yes he will, so we buy time, keep
          him busy-

                    ME
          -until when?

                    BRADLEY
          Until Tom Bethune votes on the
          floor of the city council in two
          days, ratifying the official start
          of construction on Dodger stadium-

                    ME
          -this is bigger than a fucking
          ballpark! Hector Magdalena and
          Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              *
          whole Department to hell.                       *

                    BRADLEY
          Don't be dramatic, it looks weak.
          Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit,
          so I supply him with one-                       *

                    ME
          -me. You want me to draw him off-               *

                    BRADLEY
          -you've been drawing him off. And
          the more he sees you the less he'll
          think of anything other than
          getting you. Now find Tommy and                 *
          take him alive. Do not let Noonan               *
          get to him. As a potential major                *
          case witness against the LAPD,                  *
          Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            *
          keg, he's an atom bomb.                         *

Bradley walks. Watch him disappear down the hall.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Bradley has a bigger angle and I'm
          getting close to it...I just
          haven't hit home. Yet.                          *

                                                                58.




38   INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                        38

     In a clean T-shirt from my locker. Heading toward Junior's
     desk. All eyes on my wounds. I toss Stemmons his shirt.

                         ME
               Seltzer will take the blood out.

     Junior bitchy, like some broad you stood up:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               I give you the shirt off my back                        *
               and you bash me!                                        *

                         ME
               When a Superior Officer tells you
               to leave the room, you leave the                        *
               fucking room.                                           *

     Junior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     *
     deep breath.                                                      *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               I made a file on the Bledsoe broad.
               The one you asked about.

                         ME
               Thanks. But forget it.

                          JUNIOR STEMMONS
               I spent a whole day putting it
               together and this skirt's got
               skeletons.

     Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink.
     Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
               Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17.
               Prostitution arrest at 21. Known
               associate of a Kern County homicide
               victim, this convicted pimp named
               Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp.
               Stabbed to death in his home,
               weapon never recovered-

                         ME
               Forget it. Burn it, s'not important
               now.

     Take the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed.
     Glenda priors scream back instant conviction.

                                                               59.



                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Why is it not important?

     Plant the file in his chest as my answer.

                         ME
               I need an address on a guy named
               Ainge, George Ainge-                                    *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               -what about Magdalena?

     My temper turning threadbare.

                         ME
               -after you get the Ainge address,                       *
               get back to the Magda-

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
                   (picks up Glenda's file)
               -is Ainge related to this Cunt?

     Snap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce.

                         ME
               We're partners in name only. You
               want to stay in the room next time,
               Junior? Do something to impress me:
               like finding that address.

     Dig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog
     glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face.


39   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                               39

     Driving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black
     Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        *

                         ME (V.O.)
               Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        *
               Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        *
               But I could still spot the tail.                        *

     Run a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            *

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               This jet-engine urge to see her.
               Needing it like a junkie does. No
               logic. Just the push.

                                                          60.



Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      *
the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up
sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy
handed me: Talent Domiciles.

Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with
airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the
curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check
my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face,
inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry
little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    *

Roll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my
cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine:

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Better looking than the last guy
          Howard hired. Once you heal.
              (she recognizes me)
          Wait a minute. You were there, the
          other night, the Bethune Party...                     *

My heart jammed up into my throat. Push past it.                *

                       ME
          Yeah.                                                 *

                    GLENDA
          Mickey told me this `Bent Cop'
          everybody used to call-
              (mocking, I love it:)
          -`The Enforcer' was asking about
          me. Told me to be careful. So
          you're LAPD after all...

                       ME
          In theory.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          You're going to arrest me for
          breaking and entering?

                    ME
          Depends.
              (nod to groceries)
          Those Howard's?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Everything's Howard's.

                    ME
          Except you.

                                                        61.



                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          That's why I left.

                    ME
          You just shop here now?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Some of our extras haven't had a
          vegetable since Truman.

                    ME
          Attack of the Atomic Vampires...

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
              (smiles, no flinch)
          We can't all be Audrey Hepburn.
          Plus it pays bills.

                    ME
          Better than a billionaire does?
          Go make amends and finish out your
          service contract Ms. Bledsoe.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Not if there was just one day left
          on it.

                    ME
          Why?

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          I'm better than that.

                    ME
          You're also better than a starring
          role in schlock horror flick
          that'll never see a screen,
          regardless if it's leading lady
          gets `kidnapped' or not.                              *

Drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag. She's
beat, but bluffs by.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          This isn't the first time you've
          spied on me.

                    ME
          Nor the second.

                                                             62.



                          GLENDA BLEDSOE
                   (beat)
               Well you've got me all giftwrapped,
               Enforcer-

                         ME
               -Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side
               Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright
               place to be. So please go-

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               -Glenda.
                   (this smile just for me)
               And tell Howard I'll take my
               chances with the fake vampires.

     And she twirls off, gone...watch her go...my radio buzzes.

                         ME
               Klein. Go ahead...                                      *

40   EXT. PASADENA PAYPHONE - DAY                                 40

     Out of dimes, drop slugs instead. Three rings, somebody snags
     it before the fourth. Background reverb blares, bar racket.
     Hear a muted male growl `Club Alabam...'

                         ME
               Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant
               Klein, LAPD-

     -click. Fuck. Fish for another slug. Redial. One ring. Picked
     up, same background din-

                         ME (CONT'D)
                   (push this out pronto)
               -this is LAPD-put Lester on the
               phone or I'll have your liquor
               license and after-hours permits
               yanked inside the hour...

     A muffled back and forth before Lester comes on the line:

                         LESTER LAKE
               Dave?

            I saw her singing the other night.

                      LESTER LAKE
            I think she's been truckin' with
            Tommy Mag. Got pipes like Ella but

            Dunno, but when he'd get drunk,                   *
            he'd trade Horse for blowjobs out                 *

            Called a friend of hers, a waitress
            that works here too, said she was                 *
            at Bido Lito's in Hollywood. Said                 *
            she was `hiding out.'

            She actually said `hiding out?'                   *

                      LESTER LAKE
            Then she got off the phone. Fast.
            If Tilly's running with that demon,               *
            you gotta get her out of there. She               *
            got a lot more good in her than not-              *

     Driving.

                          ME (V.O.)
                Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown
                altogether. Holed up in Hollywood.
                Hiding in plain sight.


42   INT. DINER - DAY                                          42

     Back booth with a view of the street. Bido Lito's across the
     way. Eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley. On the table
     in front of me, mugshots: known Tommy Magdalena associates.     *
     Mostly greaser kids with low-rent juvie sheets.                 *

     Stare at that photo of Tommy.

                          ME (V.O.)
                Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a
                face out front if I get lucky. Wait
                till Bido Lito's gets busy before I
                make my move.


43   INT. DINER - NIGHT (LATER)                                43

     Snub my last Chesterfield, stifle a yawn, check my Hamilton.
     9:20 PM. Bito Crowd bops out front. Valet ballet.               *
     Scanning...spot a face...pull my mugshots...Steve Wenzel,       *
     Okie white-trash from El Monte, shoving his way through the
     crush out in front of the club, hits the side alley.

     I'm up. Dump a pocketful of coins on the table. Hit the door.


44   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                  44

     Cross fast, play the wall and the shadows close. Watch as
     Wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club. Get deeper
     into the alley: a padlocked two-car overhang at the rear.
     Grip my .45, stock down, swing, split the lock. Chain spools
     at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under
     a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.       *

                          ME (V.O.)                                  *

               Now he's on foot.                                       *


45   INT. SECOND FLOOR FLOP - CONTINUOUS                          45

     Jimmy the door,   slide inside silent. Muffled sounds through
     the floor, some   jazz combo wailing away at Bido Lito's below.
     Voices down the   hall, male, laughter, goofball guffaws.
     George Gobel on   the tube: `Well, I'll be a dirty bird!

     Creep in a crouch, my .45 at the hip, safety off. Move toward
     the flicker at the far end of the hall. Sounds of pissing         *
     nearby, ease around a doorjamb .45 first: bedroom barren,
     dust-caked mattress, a half dozen bottles of Old Crow lie
     scattered among sash cords & used heroin spikes.

     Light from the bathroom...a pair of legs visible, female.
     Dark but pale, splayed from inside the bathroom...the right
     foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to
     gain some purchase on fast-draining life. Somebody flushes,
     zips up, steps over the two legs.

     Duck back into the hall as this Greaser stinking of pomade
     wafts past, weaving back toward the TV room.


46   INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    46

     Inside. Move fast now. A fist-sized lump swells mid-chest,
     blossoms into my throat. I don't want to see what I know is
     there. Turn the corner:

     Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death.
     A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. Her
     right hand claws at tile. These beautiful dark eyes stare up
     at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. Throttle marks
     on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope.

     I don't want to touch her face but I do...she closes her eyes
     the moment my fingertips hit. That gases my hate. Choke back
     sudden tears.

                         VOICE BEHIND ME
               FUCK YOU DOIN'?

     Turn back. GREASER in the doorway, brown-bagged T-Bird hits
     the floor as he reaches for his waist -- stand and shoot him
     in the throat. Drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade
     before I fire the second-third-fourth shots. He falls/flails.     *
     Jump-shock from the other room.                                   *

                                                                66.



                         ME                                            *
               POLICE!                                                 *

     Bodies scramble. No words. Just Pistol fire through the half-     *
     rotted walls -- punks taking potshots. No compliance means I      *
     hit the hallway shooting back. Firing dead-bang at a couple       *
     fleeing silhouettes -- see them pop-stumble-fall-                 *

     -the archway above my head shreds, collapses. Somebody firing
     a sub-machine gun. Flat on my ass, my back finds the wall,        *
     cough up plaster, sleeve my eyes to see. Then quiet, save the     *
     rattle-clap of changing clips.                                    *

                         ME                                            *
               PUT THAT GOD DAMN GUN DOW-                              *

                         TOMMY MAGDALENA (O.C.)
               -YOU SET ME UP YOU COCKSUCKER!

     Machine-gun fire lights up my left side. Roll. Taste floor        *
     grime as subsonic zips snap close...bullets miss by inches.       *

                         TOMMY MAGDALENA
               -RAT FUCK COP! YOU KILLED HIM                           *
               WILHITE!

     Every part of me pauses...`Wilhite'...back door gets blunted
     open, frantic footfalls recede. That big bent V-8 on Tommy's
     `32 Deuce roars to life. Up now, plow through the cloud of
     cordite. See one of Tommy's Pachucos propped up against the       *
     wall, unhit, unhurt. Point my .45 and pull the trigger a I        *
     pass. Hit an empty chamber...this punk's lucky day.


47   EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                      47

     Out the door reloading as the `32 Deuce barrels away. Tommy
     fires shots into the air to clear traffic. Wenzel in the          *
     passenger seat, screams to do the same. The Driver's side rim     *
     sparks fireworks.                                                 *

     Pandemonium out in front of Bido Lito's as the crowd
     stampedes ass-over-elbows. Sprint to my car, inside, key          *
     dispatch fast as I wheel rough off the curb:                      *

                         ME
               Shots fired, 1600 block of Ivar.                        *
               Suspect fleeing scene in red `32                        *
               Ford Deuce travelling westbound on                      *
               Wilcox, vehicle impaired, intercept                     *

     -horns blare as I slalom club-goers scrambling across Ivar.
     Punch it over-top Sunset, parallel to the Deuce. Rip a left       *
     on Selma. Stay on my radio:

                         ME
               -and I need an ambulance to respond
               to 1607 North Ivar, second floor,
               female negro, possible overdose.

     Up ahead I catch a fireworks show: the Deuce gouges pavement      *
     across the 4-way. Clip 90 MPH catching up. Squeal onto Wilcox     *
     as Tommy hooks a right onto Hollywood.                            *

     Two prowlers pass the next second, sirens lit, full scream.       *


48   EXT. HOLLYWOOD AND VINE - CONTINUOUS                         48

     Haul ass up to Hollywood, round it: See Tommy and Wenzel
     sitting upright, the Deuce spun sidelong, firing M3 `Grease
     Guns' into the approaching prowlers. Both cars go helter-
     skelter under fire. Six-packs spill to the street, belly          *
     crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire.

     Tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. Wenzel
     stays atop the car -- gun my engine, split the abandoned          *
     prowlers. Wenzel looks up mid-reload as I T-bone the `Deuce'      *
     at speed. The impact rockets him rag-doll end over end before     *
     he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple
     bruises/fractures/breaks...blood pooling in pints.

     Tommy wide-eyes the heap that was Wenzel. Kick my driver's        *
     side door open firing. Tommy cuts loose with that Grease-Gun,     *
     sprays wild. Crouch-move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz
     by overhead. More sirens approach. Tuck behind the front end
     of the mangled `Deuce.'

     Another salvo from the Grease-Gun skips up off the pavement       *
     in front of me. The six-packs have regrouped, start laying        *
     down fire on Tommy. Tommy running now -- I'm up on one knee,      *
     aiming, tucking into the .45: take his legs but don't kill h-     *

     -that Gray Packard materializes across the intersection in
     front of Tommy: shotgun blasts from the driver's side             *
     backseat obliterates Tommy's mid-section.                         *

     My mouth gapes at what just happened...then I remember to         *
     fire at the Packard as it continues down the street, running      *
     lights extinguished, no plates visible.

     Get to Tommy. Crying. Fading. Roll him on his back.               *

                                                             68.

               Where's your father!? Did Wilhite                     *
               kill him!?- TELL ME!

     -bubbling blood in place of words. Mouth moves like a           *
     grouper's...get close...his last gasp...pray it's profound.     *
     He breathes out...nothing.                                      *


49   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NIGHT                              49    *

               Bido Lito's too fast to catch a                       *
               tail. So where did they come from?                    *


50   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - DAY                            50

     Magdalena home. Pull up onto the front lawn. Grab my brass      *
     knucks from the glove box. Out of my car. Growling. A pair of   *
     Narco brims, Wilhite's boys, break wide on my approach.         *
     Junior stumbles from the stakeout car, rushing up the street
     toward me.

     Inside. Madge, this vacant glaze, tear-smudged, mock mourning   *
     with more booze and pills...word of Tommy's demise has          *
     reached her.                                                    *

     Wilhite and Lucille in the middle of some close conversation.

At Wilhite:

          Where's Magdalena's body!?                            *

                    LUCILLE                                     *
          FUCK YOU COP!                                         *

          HOW MUCH -- OR ARE YOU GIVING IT UP                   *
          FOR FREE NOW?                                         *

Sucks her steam: she knows I know. Her eyes shoot to Wilhite.   *
Grab Lucille's bruised arms. Wilhite grabs me in return. Hear   *
footfalls coming hard up the steps, Wilhite reinforcements.     *

                    WILHITE                                     *
          YOU FUCKING THUG! LET GO OF HER!                      *

                    ME                                          *
          You murdered him! That's why the                      *
          dogs didn't bark: they knew you-                      *

-hands on me, ripping/hauling. Bull-rushed back into the hall   *
by Wilhite's boys. I spin free. Wilhite flinches-trips.         *
Junior too-close, plant my shoulder into him -- push off.       *

          NO DIRECT APPROACH ON MAGD-                         *

-grab Wilhite hard, haul him into a hallway bathroom, slam    *
the door, lock it.                                            *

          What the fuck are you-                              *

          or I'm gonna kick your teeth in...                  *

Junior beating on the door.                                   *

          FUCK OFF.                                           *

Wilhite tries to push past. Gut-punch him hard, trying to     *
rupture something. Shove him back into the wall. Drywall
implodes. He squeals/shrieks, seizes his shoulder.            *

                     WILHITE                                  *
          I outrank you Klein! Are you out of                 *
          your mind?

Brass knucks gleam, get close, kow him completely.            *

          You fingered Tommy for his father's                 *
          disappearance and pressed me to do                  *
          the same to cover your ass!                         *

          Am I? Where's Hector? You can't
          file murder charges without a
          corpse. Who knows this? Cops know
          this- You would know this.

               secrets must stink like rot.                            *

     Red and blue light strobe from outside. Look: an unmarked         *
     caravan arrives. Bradley leading the charge, leaping from his     *
     sedan. Wilhite gets a split-second's worth of gloat/glee.         *

     Wilhite wide-eyed. Slouching/sinking down onto the toilet.        *
     Somebody beating on the bathroom door hard. Bradley's voice       *

53   INT. MAGDALENA HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                       53   *

     Shoulder past, start down the stairs. Bradley follows.            *

     Hit the front door, moving toward my car, Junior and the          *
     Narco brims cagey, primed for another atomic outburst.            *

          You're on one month's unpaid leave                     *
          as of this moment.                                     *

Go right at him, cut his steam.                                  *

               You're scamming something big.                       *

               -if you make any further inquiries                   *
               into this case I'll strip you of                     *
               rank, have your pension revoked and                  *

     See red. Launch. Try to wrap my hands around his throat.       *
     Watch him feather back just out of reach. Junior and a pair    *
     of six-packs restrain me.                                      *

                         ME                                         *
               What's your fucking angle Bradley!?                  *

     His eyes beam back doom.                                       *

               You're done Klein. Soon.                             *


54   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS                         54   *

     Reach the car, slide in, anger in aftershocks rattle across    *
     still balled fists. Junior at my window blathering white       *
     noise. He might as well be speaking Greek.                     *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *
               Dave listen: don't do anything else                  *
               to jeopardize yourself...I can                       *

               some things together-                                *

                         KLEIN
               Central, this is Klein, I need an
               update on that overdose I called
               in. What's the girl's condition?

     Static. Wait. Anger make my eyes ache, fuzz my focus.

                         DISPATCH
               Lieutenant Klein, the girl, Tilda
               Hopwell was pronounced D.O.A. at
               Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital-

     Rage flares, slam the radio into the dash console, crushing
     it- fists flex, blood seeps from a battered knuckle, look at   *
     my hands: blood drool over the faint remains of the pen-       *
     scrawled `A I N G E'...Glare up at Junior:                     *

                                                             75.

55   EXT. ROW HOUSE - CULVER CITY - NIGHT                         55   *

     Up the walk, Junior tailing, feel his stare.                      *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                               *
               You're in no state to conduct
               yourself as a Police Offic-

                         ME                                            *
               -shut up. Don't identify yourself,                      *
               don't badge him, don't talk.                            *

     BLACK. Then a light turns on somewhere: my gun in a round         *
     man's face just through his front door. GEORGE AINGE.             *


56   INT. GEORGE AINGE'S PAD - NIGHT                              56   *

     Tough Ainge: He doesn't flinch. Drops his lunch-pail slow.        *
     Takes off his jacket: jail-house tattoos abound. He sits.         *

                         ME                                            *
               How do you know Glenda Bledsoe?                         *

     Junior's `betrayed' look: this guy is tied to that Cooze.         *

                         GEORGE AINGE                                  *
               Knew that whore'd try to muscle me-                     *

                         ME                                            *
               -don't call her a whore again.                          *

     Laughs in my face:                                                *

                         GEORGE AINGE                                  *
               If you gave her as many paychecks                       *
               as me, you'd know `whore' fits                          *
               like a fuckin glov-                                     *

     -I grab a chair cushion, put the .45 against it, fire a           *
     muffled round that blows Ainge's hair back as it passes.          *
     Junior twitches hard enough to spot himself. Ainge jabbers:       *

                         GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                         *
               She fucked for a fee! Jesus Christ                      *
               she's a pro! What is she paying to                      *
               get that blade back-                                    *

                                                           76.



-get the gun in his face, burn his nose with the barrel.         *

                    ME                                           *
          What? What `blade?'                                    *

                     GEORGE AINGE                                *
          What's she paying you to recover                       *
          her knife?

Just then Junior banana peels it -- deliberately:                *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *
          Lieutenant!                                            *

A hate-scowl for Junior: trying to put enough heat behind it     *
to melt his head. Ainge lights up.                               *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          Y'all are Cops!?                                       *

                    ME                                           *
          Shut your mouth.                                       *

Ainge sees me bent on Glenda. Looks past me, past the gun in     *
his face, aims right at Junior.                                  *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          Back in `50, Glenda the Good Witch                     *
          put a blade in her pimp `bout as                       *
          deep as I put my pink in her, this                     *
          mongrel named Dwight Gillette.                         *

Junior fixes me, pulls that steno, starts scribbling openly -- *
I grab it, shred it. Ainge grins at the voodoo between us.     *

                    GEORGE AINGE (CONT'D)                        *
          Could use a couple LAPD favors, and                    *
          ain't guttin' a pimp still a crime?                    *

          Capitol crime.                                         *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          Guess who she asked to hold the                        *
          knife? Guess why she brought me in                     *
          on this kidnap thing? It was her                       *
          way a' buying it back-                                 *

          -show it to me.                                        *

          I'll have my lawyer take a picture                     *
          of it for you-                                         *

-throw his TV at his head: legitimately trying to kill him       *
now and he knows it. Off his chair, crawling.                    *

                     JUNIOR STEMMONS                             *
          STOP!                                                  *
              (more question than                                *
                statement)                                       *
          YOU ARE NOT BENT ON AN EX-WHORE!                       *

I grab the shattered tube: throw it again. Big POP inches        *
from Ainge. Angry at myself for missing twice:                   *

                    ME                                           *
          GOD DAMN IT-                                           *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *
          -HE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS TO A MURD-                    *

-grab Junior, sharp jab him, push him out a door for the         *
second time-                                                     *

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                     *
          -YOU WILL CEASE AND DESIST KLEIN-                      *

-final push with my foot gives me enough room to dead-bolt it    *
behind him. Ainge can't fit under his bed.                       *

                    GEORGE AINGE                                 *
          I AIN'T RESISTING YOU!                                 *

                    ME                                           *
          I'm not arresting you.                                 *

Flip the mattress. Teen Tit mags and jack-off socks fly with     *
it. Ainge under pine slats. Panic. I put my foot through,        *
bash his gut -- rip him out from underneath.                     *

                    ME (CONT'D)                                  *
              (hissing)                                          *
          Where is it?                                           *

Ainge unable to speak, gasping for air. Step to his closet:      *
shred hinges when I open it. Rip the clothes rod down:           *
nothing. Pull shelves from the wall: a Louisville Slugger        *
falls at my feet. I smile. Ainge goes frightwig. Step to him.    *

                    ME (CONT'D)                                  *
          WHERE?!                                                *

                                                               78.



     Swing it into a wall. Gaping holes in holster. Bring it back
     like Babe Ruth over his head.

                         ME (CONT'D)                                  *
               -that blade or your life.                              *

     Door bashed open behind me -- deadbolt assembly pops, pieces     *
     hit me -- then something big/black-metallic ends my night:       *
     Junior, tear-streaked cheeks, Ainge's mailbox in-hand, pulled    *
     free from the stucco. I drop. Ainge turns cheerleader:           *

                         GEORGE AINGE                                 *
               NICE!                                                  *

     Roll to my knees: guttural groans I can't place   because        *
     they're mine. Junior rips a radio cord from the   wall, wraps    *
     it around my neck, pulls my head back, feel his   tears hit my   *
     shoulders. Veins in his arms go Pop. Eyes in my   head go Pop.   *

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS                              *
               Last time you push me out a door!                      *
               For a dirty split-tail! You're-                        *
                   (cinches hard)
               -not dragging me down! If Bradley

               -you're gonna burn all by yourself!

     -go black. Then eyes open...out for hours/days/months...what?    *

     Feel. Hangman's bruise forming around my neck. Junior and        *
     Ainge gone. Floorboards under Ainge's bed pried-up. Crawl to     *

     Driving. Glenda close. I want to pull her closer. We wind         *
     along Topanga Canyon. Constant mirror checks, looking for         *
     Packards/Buicks/Ghosts...seeing nothing...I roll my window        *
     up. Light jazz on the radio gives way to the news:                *

     -click it off. Abrupt. She notices, says nothing. After
     another half mile she points to a side road: 655 TOPANGA CYN      *
     RD on the mailbox. I pull in. A gravel drive gives way to a       *
     bungalow, tucked into the trees.                                  *

                                                                85.

63   INT. MY CAR - NIGHT                                          63

     Driving. Blood-shot. Slowly being squeezed on all sides.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Looking for leverage. Figure out
               Bradley's angle before I fry.
               Madge and Lucille in custody. No
               Hector and no Tommy equals No
               leads. Save one.

                                                             86.




64   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - EARLY A.M.                      64    *

     Slouched in my front seat, watching a small flop-style motel    *
     near the beach.

                          ME (V.O.)
               Dan Wilhite.
                   (beat)
               Dispatch shot me his temporary
               address. Some beach flop he fled to
               after his wife put him out.

     Check my Hamilton: 7:32 AM. A car pulls into the parking lot.
     Two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious:
     Process Servers if ever I've seen them. One of them bears a
     sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. No
     answer. They knock rude. I roll down my window.

     Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover. Before
     he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the
     pair depart. Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope
     and reading what's inside...then rereading it.

     Gauge his reaction: ruined.

     He puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to
     protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him.
     Another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly
     walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.


65   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - NEXT MOMENT                     65

     Out of my car. Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach
     it and hear a distinct POP -- see the flash-snap from behind
     the curtains: Gunshot. I know what it is. Hit the door.


66   INT. WILHITE'S ROOM - NEXT MOMENT                         66

     Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet
     of paper still gripped in the other. Body half onto the bed,
     half off. Blood drains from a round wound in his temple.

     Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door. Pick up
     the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope. The first word I
     see: SUBPOENA.

                         ME (V.O.)
               My first thought, pure panic:
               Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena
               connection.

                                                              87.



     Flip the Subpoena over to see his Signature: not Noonan's.
     This subpoena has been issued and signed by LA District
     Attorney Bob Gallaudet. Flip it back over, wide-eyed:

                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena.
               Wilhite was being called to testify
               by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't
               piss without Bradley's say-so.
                   (beat)
               Bradley trying to beat Noonan to
               the punch and burn the LAPD
               himself...why?


67   EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER                                      67

     A quick check of the lot. Empty. A housekeeping cart sits
     nearby. Swipe a bottle of bleach from it. Walk to Wilhite's
     Studebaker Powerhawk. Pop the trunk, return to his room.

     Move quick. Fireman's carry, dump Wilhite's body in the
     trunk. Toss his service .38 too. Pour the bottle of bleach to
     stanch the inevitable rot smell.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Swap my car for Wilhite's. The
               former head of the LAPD's Narcotics
               division dead in the trunk. Call it
               the leverage I was looking for --
               his body can buy me out of bad spot-

     -and that's when I see it: a bandage poking out from under         *
     Wilhite's collar...undo a couple buttons, lift the bandage.        *

                                                      FLASH TO:


68   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - NIGHT                              68   *

     BAM: me hit from behind by the Peeper. BAM: me firing at the       *
     Peeper. Hit him in the left shoulder. BAM: Grabbing Wilhite's      *
     shoulder in the Magdalena bathroom, him howling in pain.           *

                                                      RETURN TO:        *


69   INT. WILHITE'S GARAGE - NEXT MOMENT                           69   *

     The kind of wound a grazed bullet leaves.                          *

                                                              88.



                         ME (V.O.)                                    *
               Wilhite was the Peeper. Bent on                        *
               Lucille, a girl younger than his                       *
               youngest daughter. Call it grounds
               for divorce...Call Wilhite Hector
               Magdalena's murderer...

     Slam the trunk as Wilhite's glazed eyes stare back at me.


70   EXT. STREET - A.M.                                          70   *

     Slow cruise, new ride means no tails. Check my mirrors           *
     anyway. Back to the pad, back-streets all the way.               *


71   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - A.M.                        71   *

     Rounding the corner -- break hard: those same process servers
     leaning on my doorbell now.

                         ME
               Bradley trying to bury me too. That
               subpoena means my fifteen year
               career with the LAPD just went up
               in smoke.

     Continue past. Those Process Geeks keep buzzing my doorbell.


72   INT. BREAKFAST JOINT PAY-PHONE - MORNING                    72

     Drop dimes. Dial Pete.

                          ME
               Hey-

                         PETE (O.S.)
               -Junior's left the fucking planet.

                         ME
               You find him?

                         PETE
               Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car
               was out front. I scoped it: a sawed-
               off shotgun in front, canned tuna
               in the back seat. Think he's living
               outta that car. After he left, I
               tried to get inside his place: The
               front door is triple pad-locked.

                                                             89.



                         ME
                   (out loud)
               That knife is in there-

                            PETE
               -the what?

     Shit. Ignore it, maybe Pete will too.

                         ME
               Meet me down the street from his
               place. You got bolt cutters?

                         PETE
               I'll bring `em.

                         ME
               Thirty minutes.


73   EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY                              73

     Junior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up.
     Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors. Sans tail
     as I pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy. Step out,
     sidle up driver's side.

                         PETE
               Who's car is that?

                         ME
               Long story.

                         PETE
               Junior looked real skeezed this
               morning. Like he was on a dope jag.

                            ME
               Yeah?

                         PETE
               Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be
               careful. He was fucking around with
               his front door before he left. I
               don't know what he was doing.

                         ME
               Two honks if he shows. Then meet me
               in the alley, back of his place.

                                                             90.



                         PETE
                   (handing me bolt-cutters)
               What about this Bledsoe broad?
               Milteer has called me twice.

                         ME
                   (taking the bolt-cutters)
               One thing at a time pal.


74   EXT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                    74

     Hustle across the street. Hang my badge over my shirt-pocket.


75   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          75

     Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver
     hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a
     shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine
     stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig-
     sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine
     stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it.

     Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges.


76   INT. APT. 303 - NEXT MOMENT                               76

     Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry-
     rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger
     of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level.

     Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching
     Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Junior the Insane: You couldn't
               hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA,
               and not have it rot your mind.

     Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished
     with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his
     shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed
     jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag.

     Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it.
     Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Junior stealing evidence from the
               Magdalena crime scene.

                                                                      91.



Then I see the bookcase. Top shelf: Police manuals. Bottom
two shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the
same brand. Shock. Step over. Flip through them: tiny,
architect-neat script covers every page. The running dialogue
of a functional fucking freak:

MAGDALENA RESIDENCE. 1284 S. TREMAINE. RECOVERED: MAGDALENA FINANCIAL
RECORDS/LEDGERS. SOME ENTRIES REDACTED. TRANSLATED `HH' INTO
`HURWITZ HOLDINGS' AFTER RECOVERING MAIL. SEEMS SUSPICIOUS. BROUGHT
TO ATTENTION OF KLEIN. BRUSHED OFF. PRESS IN SPITE OF KLEIN'S LAZINESS OR
LACK OF INTEREST.

A hand drawn cock doodled beneath that, then below:

DAVE WEARING FORM-FITTING SHIRT TODAY. HANDSOME. I WANT TO PULL IT-

-drop the steno like it might bite. Pick up another: same
drill.

WELLES NOONAN WILL WIN OUT. KLEIN NOT SKILLED OR SMART ENOUGH TO
DUEL WITH A U.S. ATTORNEY MUCH LESS THE FBI. DEEP ADMIRATION FOR
NOONAN'S CAUSE. HIS PURPOSE IS PURE. DON'T WANT TO GET DRAGGED DOWN
WITH POISON PILL KLEIN. MAKE HIM PAY FOR PATRONIZING ME.

Pick up yet another, hands shaking, turn to the last page:

MAKE KLEIN HURT LIKE I HURT. TRADE HIM. TRADE EVERYTHING. TRADE UP TO
THE BUREAU. THINK OF IT: AGENT RICHARD STEMMONS JR. PROUD-PROUD. 1
DREAM DOWN, 10,000 TO GO!

                      ME (V.O.)
            Junior the Climber, trading me up
            to Noonan. Thinks bootlicking will
            buy him a Bureau gig.

Now, rifle for that knife. Systemically destroy the place.
Dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike,
watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random
paperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled
by the dozen.

Under the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps. Spring them,
clear a space. A Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay
classified ads. First-person perspective Polaroids of
Junior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice-
versa.

Open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. Arsenal:
handguns, shotguns, a surplus M-1. Dump it, kick contents.
Only interested in that knife.

                                                             92.



     Move into his kitchenette. Check the freezer even though
     Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka,
     benzedrine, cocaine. Close it. Look down. STOP: indents in
     the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit.

     Pull to see what's behind. Eyes catch the bear-trap near the
     bed as I tug: ugly-rusted-waiting. STOP part II: Contort,
     peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade
     duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe.

                         MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.)
               The safe scared me more than all of
               it because a safe doesn't get
               installed overnight...he'd been
               working on something, planning
               something...

     Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the
     refrigerator. My bolt-cutters snap it. Pull the refrigerator
     out now. The safe bolted into the drywall. Stare at it: the
     dial, the black paint-job...

                                                       CUT TO:

     Loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello
     mold. Back into the kitchen. Exhale. BEGIN BLASTING. Massive
     noise. Six shots. Reload fast: nothing can muffle this
     clatter. SECOND VOLLEY. Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall
     out. Gagging on gunsmoke. Rip at the safe -- something gives.
     THIRD VOLLEY. The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole.

     Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like
     honks. Quick peek: Pete gone. A Black Buick with two white-
     walled FEDS up front. Then Junior gets out of the backseat...

     Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the
     snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front
     of Junior's door. Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck
     it under my arm. Back into the kitchenette. Turn on the gas
     but don't light the burners. Pull the grenade off the wall.
     Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.


77   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NEXT MOMENT                              77

     Out the window, on the escape, toss the evidence-bag down to
     Pete, then push the safe over the railing. Feature it almost
     crush the back of Pete's idling Cadillac. Pete jumps, yells:

                          PETE
               Asshole!

                                                             93.



                         ME
               Get it open if you can and meet me
               back at Meg's!

     Doesn't move until I pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the
     pin down on him. He jumps back in, peels off-


78   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT               78

     -Junior on the second-floor landing, heading to his place.
     Bloodshot bleary wide eyes, spun on a combo of drugs, the
     Feds herding him like a rabid dog:

                         JUNIOR STEMMONS
               Stay right here. I'll get it all
               and come back. Don't move.


79   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - SAME MOMENT                               79

     Ricochet the grenade back into the kitchen. Leap down half a
     flight: put exterior brick between my head and the-

     -BIG BOOM -- the grenade goes off.


80   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME MOMENT               80

     Junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight. Feds
     come sprinting. Screaming Junior tackles one on the way up.
     Juniors' front-door blown off. Terrified Neighbors greeted
     with images of Sodom scattered from the explosion: drugs,
     mags, dildos. The Fed that didn't get tackled picks up a
     photo: Junior kissing a hairy stomach.

     And Junior's mind snaps cleanly in-half. Crawls away growling
     like a bear caught in one of his traps.


81   EXT. ALLEY - NEXT MOMENT                                     81

     I step calm. Clear the alley slow. Don't let your stride give
     you away. Another Black Buick arrives. More Bureau stiffs.
     Keep moving. Looky-Loos pop up along the block, pointing. I'm
     the only one not looking back toward Junior's now flaming
     pad. The Powerhawk still another street up. Fire engines wail
     close.

     Shouts from behind now. Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my
     way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me.

                                                             94.



                         ME (V.O.)
               Call it. Keep going and give up
               Wilhite's car and the corpse
               inside, or lay back and deal with
               Noonan's Buzzcuts.

     Lace my fingers behind my head, turn to face them -- catch a
     form tackle from this geeked up junior G-Man diving from the
     Buick, drives his shoulder and takes me down sprawling.


82   INT. L.A. FEDERAL BUILDING - LATER                        82

     Welles Noonan staring. He picks nipped/mutilated fingernails.

                          ME (CONT'D)
               Civil servants can't afford
               manicures?

                         WELLES NOONAN
               Breaking and entering, theft, and
               willful destruction of private
               property...and I'll add attempted
               murder to the current first degree
               murder charge I'm about to file
               against you.

                         ME
               Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't
               be fucking around with shitty
               shakedown routine -- you'd file.
               Coercion equals confession. So
               let's see you pound it out of me.

                         WELLES NOONAN
               Where are the files you stole from
               Sergeant Richard Stemmons.

                         ME
               Junior. Your secret weapon right? I
               mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted
               fuck, but traditionally `vicious
               fags' don't make the best major
               case witnesses.
                   (beat, keep pushing)
               I'm worried those burning dildos
               may have damaged his credibility.

                         WELLES NOONAN
               Oh I don't need his testimony
               Klein. I'll just force yours.

                                       95.



          ME
Not if you had the next hundred
years.

          WELLES NOONAN
Sanderline Johnson, your links to
Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen,
extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire.
I'll put you in every pair of cross-
hairs I can find. I'll torch
everything you've ever touched. You
have no idea how deep I run Klein.
And how far I'm willing to go to
fuck you-

          ME
-everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit.
What are you proving? Bradley's the
guy flanking you right now. The guy
who's vulnerable right now.

          WELLES NOONAN
You're all angles and graft Klein.
Why trust a God damn word that
comes out of your-

          ME
-you done anything with the
Magdalena case?

          WELLES NOONAN
    (thrown)
Prelims: drug pusher gone missing,
presumed dead, we're investigat-

          ME
    (scoffing)
-Dealing drugs for 20 years!
Arrested once. Hall a' fame career!
You photographed the head of Narco
in-front of his house...

          WELLES NOONAN
AND?

          ME
Jesus Christ, you need cue cards?
    (sell this fucker now)
Come after me: you get me. Go after
what I can give you and you get the
LAPD's power-set on a slab.

                                                          96.



                    WELLES NOONAN
          I don't believe you'd turn.
          Treacherous yes, traitorous no.
          Tell me where Stemmons' files are.

                    ME
          I'll bring them to you.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          You're not leaving here Klein.

                    ME
          Then like I said: you only get me.

Noonan stands, firm:

                    WELLES NOONAN
          I'll take it.

On his way out I speak fast -- the last ace in my deck:

                    ME
          I give you the body of Dan Wilhite,
          head of LAPD's Narcotics Division.
          Proof of a 20-year criminal
          collusion between his department
          and Hector Magdalena and my
          testimony to link the dots.
              (beat, make him believe)
          Then I leave LA for good.

Noonan at the door: please bite-please bite...but he just
smirks, walks out. Real panic now: no ideas on what comes
next. 15 seconds. Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies
pushes a sheet. Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement. Noonan
back: two cups of coffee. Read it over.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          What happened to Wilhite?

                       ME
          Suicide.

                    WELLES NOONAN
          Like Sanderline Johnson?

Ignore him. Sign the agreement.

                    WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)
          Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's
          body by noon tomorrow.

Gulp the coffee back, the burn feels good.

                                                             97.



                         ME
               No more tails. I don't want anyone
               else incriminated.

                           WELLES NOONAN
               Agreed.

                         ME
                   (nod to agreement)
               I get a copy of that?

                         WELLES NOONAN
               After a judge signs it. Now Leave.

     Stand-nod-take my coffee-leave. Door closes. Noonan shreds
     the Witness agreement. Tosses it in the trash. Off the
     baffled Deputy.

                          WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D)
               We wait for him to deliver, then we
               arrest him. You never saw that
               agreement.

                           DEPUTY #1
               Tail him?

                         WELLES NOONAN
               No. Let him get comfortable...let
               him believe me.


83   INT. CAB - NIGHT                                             83

     Backseat. Suborned Cabby driving fast. LAPD on board.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Running out of room, time, both.
               Trapped between Bradley and Noonan.

     Jump out of the cab, into Wilhite's Powerhawk. Slide in, slam
     the door.


84   INT. MEG'S PLACE - LATER                                     84

     Bust in shaking. Teeth chatter like I'm freezing. Pete in the
     garage adjacent the kitchen, welder's goggles and a power
     drill, punching holes in Junior's safe.

                         PETE
               I know what Feds look like -- those
               were Feds with Junior...

                                                             98.



                         ME
               Yeah and they made me leaving the
               scene. Had to barter out.

                         PETE
               Barter what?

                         ME
               My Testimony. I signed a Federal
               Witness Agreement.

     Pete drops the drill.

                           PETE
               You what?

                          ME
               It's bullshit. Noonan's got no
               intention of honoring it.
                   (beat)
               They want Stemmons files though. I
               think Junior's been working angles
               for awhile, doing his own
               investigations.

                         PETE
               What did you do to his place? Nice
               quiet neighborhood one minute,
               Nagasaki the next.

                         ME
                   (point to safe)
               He had a hand grenade tied to that.
                   (as Pete resumes drilling)
               How much longer do you need?

                          PETE
               Few more hours. Maybe. Junior
               didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta
               bore right through the face plate.
                   (beat)
               You got some time now, why don't
               you get Milteer off my back and go
               work that Bledsoe broad.

                         ME
               You read my mind.


85   EXT. TOPANGA CANYON BUNGALOW - NIGHT                      85

     Pull in. Glenda's Vette parked behind. Lights on low inside.

                                                             99.




86   EXT./INT. BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER                        86

     The door opens. She's dressed for bed. I don't hesitate,
     afraid she'll shun me. Move to her, she doesn't startle. An
     arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers.

     I take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before
     they tell me it's okay...I lean in, takes a lifetime...and
     kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my
     split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in.

     She feels exactly like I imagined.

     My coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving toward
     a bed in back. I stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over
     her shoulders. I whisper:

                         ME
               ...tell me if I'm being too rough.

     Tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even
     harder, pulls me down to her. We make love like we've never
     touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley.
     Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes it all away.
     I escape into her. Hours fall. I could stay here forever...


87   INT. BEDROOM - LATER                                      87

     Lying there, staring at her. A silence and peace I've never
     known. Not once.

                         ME
               Tell me anything. Tell me
               everything.

     Label her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just
     as quickly. A long moment as she waivers...commits:

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Where would I start?

                            ME
               Why here?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Why L.A.?
                   (this amazing smile)
               Why is anybody here? Want the rest
               of the world to know who they are.

                                                       100.



                    ME
          You?

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE
          No...I don't think so.
              (beat)
          I just love it. I grew up in
          Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd
          take me to the movies.

Me watching her...tucks her hair back over his shoulders.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)                     *
          The idea that you can outlive
          yourself...that a part of you goes
          on, long after you're gone.
              (beat, grins)
          Sounds silly doesn't it? `Attack of
          the Atomic Vampires' being-

                    ME
          -your ticket to immortality?

Make her laugh. Swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her.
He face slowly goes dark.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Hughes told me he could get me in
          for this screen test two years ago.
          Movie with Gregory Peck at
          Universal. He thought he was
          humoring me...until I got it. They
          offered me the role...there in the
          room. So Howard, who I'm sure never
          thought in a million years I'd land
          that part, makes some phone calls
          and just like that they don't want
          me anymore.
              (beat)
          Nobody calls now. I can't get in to
          see any studio casting people. He's
          ruined me in those circles.

                    ME
          And you still want it-

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          -bad enough to put on a silly
          cheerleading skirt and try to make
          the most god-awful dialogue sound
          decent.

                                                         101.



                    ME
          Surrounded by winos in werewolf
          suits.
              (she laughs, I laugh)
          That's...dedication.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Or desperation. Depends on the day.

The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)
          I'll get there though.
              (beat)
          I'll get there.

I let the silence take...try not to shatter it with:

                    ME
          Dwight Gillette.

She doesn't blanch.

                     GLENDA BLEDSOE
          He asked me to take his `niece and
          nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard.
          These beautiful, funny little kids.
              (tears she doesn't swipe)
          I dropped them off. Didn't ask any
          questions -- I believed Dwight. A
          week later I saw their pictures in
          the Post Office. A week after that
          their little bodies came in on the
          tide near San Pedro.
              (beat, tears stream)
          I'll never shake the thought that
          maybe those poor kids thought I was
          part of it. That I knew what was
          going to happen to them. So I pray
          to God that he let them look in
          when I put that knife into Dwight.
              (beat)
          But I'll never ask his forgiveness
          for doing it...
              (beat, clears her eyes)
          Why do they call you `Enforcer?'

She actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me.

                    ME
          I've killed 44 men.

                                                              102.



     She blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away
     from mine.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for
               profit -- mostly. Why did you sign
               with Hughes, knowing what he was?

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               `For profit -- mostly.'

     Silence. A feeling like: `and there we are...'

                         ME
               I'm not much good.

                         GLENDA BLEDSOE
               Me neither.

     She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and
     it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She
     takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things
     audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out.

     BLACK.

     Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow.

     Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her
     lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the
     last good thing you'll get today.


88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88

     Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light.
     On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short-
     stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching
     for something else...Pete's voice behind me:

                         PETE (O.C.)
               The Knife ain't there. File on top
               of that middle pile: George Ainge
               in an `undisclosed locale.'

     I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down.

                         PETE
               Junior documented everything like a
               fucking Monk.
                   (pulls a file)
               Like here: `has evidence' you
               murdered Sanderline Johnson.
                         (MORE)

                                                            103.

                     PETE (cont'd)
           Kept track of `suspected contract
           killings' you pulled for the mob.

Look at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes.

                     ME
           You been up all night?

                     PETE
           In-case Stemmons made a house-call.
           He's got every goddamn address of
           everybody you know...
               (beat, hard)
           And you should've told me about the
           Bledsoe broad.

                     ME
           There's nothing to tell.

Feature Pete, righteously pissed:

                     PETE
           Then call Milteer about this dead
           Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind
           like you, but I'll bet a murder
           beef would violate her morals
           clause quick.
               (beat, hands phone)
           Collect the rest of your money.

                     ME
           I don't want it anymore.

                     PETE
           Then give that five grand back.

                     ME
           Junior stole it.

Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks:

                     PETE
           People are gonna start lining-up to
           see you bleed, Pal.

Door closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same
architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry:

SUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE
SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS
KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH
SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN
COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946
JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST.

                                                            104.



     Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript
     clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to
     the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan.

     Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY.
     Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover.
     Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across
     a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS'

     I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...


89   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                           89

     Barrel down the hallway toward Bradley's office. A habitual
     eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers.
     Stop. Veer toward him...

                         KOENIG
                   (formal-frosty)
               Your young partner called me at my
               home, early this morning.

     Teeth grit. Hide it. Let Koenig talk.

                         KOENIG (CONT'D)
               Heavily inebriated. Speaking
               inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how
               the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by
               justice.' Is this the `bind' of
               which we spoke earlier?

                         ME
               Yeah.

                         KOENIG
               And his apartment -- there was some
               type of disturbance? A fire?

                         ME
               That's why I needed his address. I
               was trying to help him before
               something like this happened. The
               kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's
               literally lost it.
                   (beat, deadpan)
               He say anything else to you?

     Koenig looks back at me. Give nothing away...one gesture that
     doesn't read right and he'll know. He lets more seconds pass
     than he should. Trying to shake me.

                                                            105.



                         KOENIG
               Only that he was in possession of
               materials that might deeply damage
               Chief Bradley...and yourself.

                         ME
               Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his
               lid. I don't want to go to Internal
               Affairs but I'm afraid Junior
               might've forced just that.

                         KOENIG
               Let me try to locate the lad first
               Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a
               young career so soon.

                         ME
               Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.

     Spin, press on toward Bradley's office.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in
               the LAPD, digging. He'll find
               Junior and when he does he'll find
               Ainge...then Glenda...

     Reach Bradley's office, burst in. Empty. To his Secretary:

                         ME
               Where is he?

                         SECRETARY
                   (frowns at my informality)
               Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.


90   EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - DAY                                     90

     Park the Powerhawk. Downwind. Out. Walking. Check my
     Hamilton: 12:10 PM.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Noonan's deadline lapsed ten
               minutes ago. An official fugitive
               from justice now.

     Down below, Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow: glazed-fear,
     following him like he's handcuffed. PROTESTORS gather,
     placards hoisted, chants: "Dodgers, No! Mexico, Si!" The
     group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus
     continues: "DODGERS NO! MEXICO SI!'

                                                       106.



                    ME (V.O.)
          Bradley doing damage control, the
          forced relocation of the Ravine's
          immigrants has the press in a
          feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced
          along as the token Mexican
          mouthpiece.

Reporters press. Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb.

                    BRADLEY
          -this area has long been rife with
          crime and venality, but with a
          brand new Stadium, we can make this
          horrible blight a bright spot and
          give our Los Angeles Dodgers the
          home they deserve.
              (like Ruiz was an orphan)
          Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his
          travails growing up in this
          horrible slum and why now is the
          time to `Redeem The Ravine.'

                    REPORTER #2
          Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney
          Noonan has promised to deliver
          surprise witnesses before the
          Federal Grand jury on-

-Bradley, this brilliant rebuke:

                    BRADLEY
          -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous
          hack politician whose smear
          campaign against us will fail, for
          he has grievously underestimated
          the moral rectitude of the Los
          Angeles Police Department.

Then Bradley sees me. His press-friendly face contorts, the
shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it. He
shifts back from snarl to smile...

                    BRADLEY
          Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave
          you with Reuben Ruiz.

Ruiz begins his forced/coerced/do-it-or-we'll-fuck-you sob
story as Bradley steps away from the glare. I follow. Get
right on his heels.

                                                          107.



                    ME
          Your subpoena hasn't caught up to
          me yet, Chief...

Bradley spins back.

                    ME (CONT'D)
              (hand him Junior's file)
          Hurwitz Holdings.

Bradley blanches, buckles. I see it. Before he can play
stupid with: `What?'

                    ME (CONT'D)
          You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought
          big chunks of Chavez Ravine over
          the past two years through a shell
          company called Hurwitz Holdings.
              (beat, look around)
          If the Dodgers move here the value
          of the land booms...you could sell
          it off for a fortune -- or hang
          onto it and make even more. The
          parking lots alone would make you
          all multi-millionaires.

Bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that
dooms both his immediate and distant future...

                    ME
          Word gets out that the three City
          Officials who were pushing hardest
          for a Stadium also stood to gain a
          mint -- might color public opinion.
          Might color it even more to know
          that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives
          was trying to purchase a huge tract
          of that land from the biggest dope
          dealer in town.

Slap another file over the one he's reading.

                    ME
          Hector Magdalena owned ten and half
          acres of this land.
              (beat, ram him)
          You didn't give a shit about
          solving his disappearance. You were
          worried that your real estate deal
          was going south.
                    (MORE)

                                                       108.

                     ME (cont'd)
          That's why you wanted Tommy found,
          not because he was a murder suspect
          or you were concerned that Noonan
          might tap him as a federal
          witness...you needed him to
          finalize your fucking land grab. To
          sign paperwork in place of his dead
          Dad. That's why you've got Madge
          and Lucille in custody now.
              (beat)
          Maybe I'll let your subpoena find
          me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right
          into it...the tales I could tell.

All Bradley can muster is:

                    BRADLEY
          How?

                    ME
          Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence
          teacher. His `excellent ratings'
          didn't stop him from stealing the
          Magdalena seizure and doing his own
          investigation.

                    BRADLEY
          Why would he investigate me?

Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in
American Blue.

                     ME
          That was stapled to the cover.
              (beat)
          Why would Noonan worry about a Turd
          like me now...when a high profile
          target like you can be taken down.

Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling.

                    BRADLEY
          Where is Stemmons?

                    ME
          No idea. If you haven't spoken to
          Internal Affairs today, I'm sure
          they've called. Junior's apartment
          caught fire. Deeply deviant
          material inside. Round him up-
              (my angle)
          -and anyone he's got with him.

Bradley readjusts his glasses.

                                                         109.



                    BRADLEY
          I'll issue an A.P.B. saying
          Stemmons is a known deviant
          targeting kindergarten children.

                    ME
          Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed
          Wilhite too.

Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled.

                      BRADLEY
          How do y-

                    ME
          -don't worry `how.' Why?

Bradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          You're going after Narco yourself.

                    BRADLEY
          Exposing the corrupt parts of the
          LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll
          prove that Police can police
          themselves-

                    ME
          -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his
          crusade and condemn your own before
          he can...Jesus Christ can you turn
          lemons to lemonade.

                    BRADLEY
          No Cop will testify against other
          Cops. This is why Wilhite has
          suddenly disappeared.

                     ME
          And how.
              (beat)
          So where do we go now Chief?

                    BRADLEY
              (beat, eyes flick again to
               the files I'm holding...)
          There are other forces at work
          here...faces we need to identify.
          Names we need to know. A third
          party.

                                                            110.

                         BRADLEY (cont'd)
               Find out who Klein and I'll
               reinstate you, rescind that
               subpoena & burn the coroner's
               report on Sanderline-

                         ME
               -that report is only useful to
               Noonan now.

                         BRADLEY
               No. It ensures our mutual
               destruction should you choose to
               share the contents of that Stemmons
               file. Which I know you won't do
               until you figure out how it will
               best benefit you.

     He walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the
     press ranks once again.

                         ME (V.O.)
               A mistake to underestimate me now
               Chief. The price to keep your
               secrets is steep...and you're going
               to pay up. Soon.

     Back to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near
     it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They
     see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers:

                         SIX-PACK
               Something in your trunk smells to
               high hell Lieutenant.

                            ME
               Dead body.

     Laughter. Easily amused academy types. Brush by grinning,
     give `em an "Enforcer" story to tell the other rookies. I
     jump in the Powerhawk and tear off.

                         ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Borrowed time burning fast. My days
               are done. Only hours remain.
               Whatever moves I have left...make
               them now.


91   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - LATER                                     91

     Going through files. Filling my own steno pad with scrawl.
     Pete walks in from the garage, face bunched up, bit-lemon.

                                                       111.



                    PETE
          Fucking Christ. You can't keep that
          car in the garage, the smell's
          coming into the house.

Meg wanders in, dressed for work.

                    MEG
          Open the windows.

                    PETE
          That's not gonna help.

                    ME
              (still scribbling)
          Take a couple bottles of bleach,
          pour it over the trunk.

                    PETE
          What do you got in there?

                    ME
          My foreseeable future.

                    MEG
          I'm going to work.

She kisses me on my head. I turn:

                    ME
          You taking her?

                    PETE
              (God damn glowering)
          I'm taking her.

Meg walks out. Pete lingers. I'm starting to sour him. Not
smart. He stares. I look up.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          What?

                    PETE
          Hughes.

                    ME
          This is almost over Pete -- I'll
          give Milteer the five-grand back.

                    PETE
          It's more than that.

                                                       112.



                    ME
          I'll square it. It's my thing.

                    PETE
          That you made mine.

                       ME
          I'm sorry.

A beat. Pete sketches me head to toe.

                    PETE
          Look as bad as I've ever seen you.

                    ME
          Things are as bad as they've ever
          been...

Pete exhales. Stalks off. I keep scribbling.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Bradley's Third Party Theory.
          Everything linked: Wilhite,
          Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my
          own theories...and the one that
          sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong
          about.

Meg's phone blares, I answer it on reflex.

                       ME (CONT'D)
          Klein.

I hear rasp on the other end, hyperventilating, unhinged.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me!
          That Cooze you threw everything
          away for is still cooked! I got the
          knife. I got Ainge-

Junior. Jesus.

                    ME
          How'd you get this number Junior?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          I got everything on you! AND I'M
          GONNA USE IT!

                    ME
          -you're a broom-closet Queer. Your
          career is over.

                                                       113.



                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          The knife for MY file on Bradley.
          I know you already burned that
          Whore's but don't think I can't re-
          do investigations.

                    ME
          You snitch to Noonan, then what?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies.

                    ME
          Who? The Soviets?

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Meet me in one hour with that file,
          Fern Dell Park-

                    ME
          -Where you used to snag fruits for
          Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          Be there with Bradley's file or I
          scratch your scabby Bitch.

                    ME
          Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?

The phone on the other end seems to break-in half. Hang up,
it rings a beat later. Junior still wanting to spar. Snag the
receiver, rip his shit:

                    ME (CONT'D)
          -I see anybody near there Junior,
          the deals off and I gift that file
          to Bradley to fuck you with-

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          -Dave?

                    ME
              (big beat)
          Glenda?

He's got her. Junior. Sick. Evil. My mind cannibalizes itself
with "where-is-she-how-do-I-get-her-back" when:

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
          Sorry...you gave me this number...

He doesn't have her. A sigh so big, it steals all my air...

                                                            114.



                           ME
                 Jesus...hey...


92   INTERCUT:                                                  92

                           GLENDA
                 Who were you talking-

                           ME
                 -no, no. It's nothing. I had a
                 phone call, just before yours.

     A beat. Glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking
     the canyon. She sits up.

                           GLENDA
                 Was it him? The Cop you were
                 telling me about?

                           ME
                 I don't want you to worry. I'm
                 handling it. But I might send my
                 friend Pete out there.

                           GLENDA
                 You don't think it's safe?

                           ME
                 I'd just rather have someone there
                 with you.

                           GLENDA
                 I wish you would've woken me up
                 this morning.

                           ME
                 I'm better-looking in low light, I
                 didn't want to blow it for myself.

     She laughs. Makes me smile despite my world caving-in...

                           ME (CONT'D)
                 Stay by the phone.

                           GLENDA
                 I miss you.

     And I melt. Love-struck at possibly the worst fucking moment
     of my life. Hang up before your voice breaks. Grab a pen,
     scrawl for Pete, post it on the fridge magnet: `PETE: 655
     TOPANGA. STAY WITH HER. PLEASE.'

                                                            115.




93   EXT. FERN DELL PARK - EVENING                             93

     Rolling green. Half-dirt, half-asphalt path. I scan for any
     back-up. Nothing. Junior already there. Astride like Gary
     Cooper. His eyes bloodshot from here. My gun riding quick-
     draw style. The heft feels good. Unbutton my coat to show him
     the file as I approach, tucked right behind my .45.

                         ME
               Where's the knife.

     Junior, this evil little curl. He turns. Follow him over a
     small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting. A silhouette behind
     the wheel. As we near it the lights come on, blind me.

                         ME
               Turn your lights off...and just
               come out and talk to me...Fritz.

     A pause in the car, Junior looks at me like I'm Rasputin,
     divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over LA. The
     lights pop off and I hear a tired laugh coming from the car
     that we've all heard before.

                         ME (V.O.)
               Third Party Confirmed...I fucking
               knew it.

     Fritz Koenig steps out of the Packard.

                         KOENIG
               Not much with these sub-rosa
               things...

                         ME
                   (a nod to the Packard)
               I thought it was Noonan tailing me.

                         KOENIG
               Bradley's greatest stroke was
               enlisting you to his side.

     Junior, jumpy in my periphery. I don't like it.

                         ME (CONT'D)
               Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not
               Narco.

                         KOENIG
               When did you know?

                                                              116.



                         ME
               I didn't. I had a feeling. I
               smelled cover-up all over Hector's
               disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't
               have the muscle or the mind-set to
               kingpin something that big by
               himself...you knew about Bradley
               trying to buy him out?

                         KOENIG
               He was offering to exonerate Hector
               and clear his criminal record.
               Hector met with Wilhite and I to
               inform us of his decision...

                                                    FLASHBACK TO:


94   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - PAST                                94

     For the first and only time, WE SEE Hector Magdalena, alive
     and well...for the moment...speaking to Koenig and Wilhite.

                         KOENIG (V.O.)
               ...to accept Bradley's deal...

     Koenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs.

                         KOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...and although the terms of that
               deal worked well for him. I found
               them less than favorable...

     Koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before
     shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest. Wilhite
     staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the
     coup de grace head-shot to Hector.

                         KOENIG
               Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots
               for Human Vice. These are slums I
               run & profit from. If these slums
               suddenly become Stadiums, that
               profit goes elsewhere...that crime
               goes elsewhere.

                         ME
               Bradley...you two got greed in
               common.

     Koenig grins. Junior keeps shifting. Dying to shoot him dead.

                                                       117.



                    ME
          You knew about Wilhite and Lucille.
          That's how you were operating him.

                    KOENIG
          I was aware of his sexual
          predilections.

                    ME
              (a scowl for Junior)
          ...and someone else's...

                     KOENIG
              (that great white grin )
          We share an eye for human frailty
          and we're both born blackmailers
          Dave.
              (beat)
          I knew young Stemmons here had a
          fondness for Lads, stretching back
          to his days at the academy.

                    ME
          And now you're his only ally.
              (back at Junior)
          This sad queer who fell out with
          cops and flunked out with the Feds.
              (back to Koenig)
          So you get this file to battle
          Bradley with. What's Junior get in
          return?

And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I
twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and
drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant
trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a
pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          JUST YOU! YOU FUCK!

Look down, SEE: A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the
business end stuck deep. Junior laughing as I fall to my
knees. He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
              (two inches from my face)
          THERE'S YOUR KNIFE KLEIN!

Koenig takes the file, opening it.

                                                       118.



                    KOENIG
              (turning his back)
          I don't want to watch...I'm sorry
          it came to this, Dave.

Junior, his own .45 pulled, put to my head.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth
          it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a
          crooked cop, you think small.

Koenig reads the file's first page, lifts it...a blank page
behind...and behind that one...

                    ME (V.O.)
          Whatever moves I had left...I just
          made.

Koenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file.

                    KOENIG
          This isn't it!

-Junior looks: that's all I need. Pull the pig-sticker off my
ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. Junior bleats
slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free. Grab
his tie, pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and
fire two shots through the top of his head.

Haul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand
flashes to his shoulder. Shoot him twice. He goes down
gargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as
I slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood
flow saturate my pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes me as I
approach Koenig.

He pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head.
This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his
hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky.

                    KOENIG
          Poorly played Dave...poorly
          played...

Say nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal
clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum
about to beg for change.

                    KOENIG
          Could I talk you into something?
          Cut you in on something?

                                                            119.



     Give him no hope.

                         ME
               Won't work for me Fritz.

     He nods, remorse, resignation...it at all looks the same now.

                         KOENIG
               Give me a minute then?

     I do. Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an
     ankle grab, his back-up piece...none comes. He sets his shoes
     aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this
     short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.

                         KOENIG
                   (with a nod)
               Okay...

     ...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content
     as I shoot him. Cross to Junior now, rifle his clothes,
     retrieve a hotel key, Room 16, read it: MOTEL COMMODORE -
     1195 Centinela Ave. Inglewood, CA 90302


95   INT. MOTEL COMMODORE - INGLEWOOD - LATE NIGHT             95

     George Ainge, sweating on a stained bedsheet, smoking reefer,
     goofing on a TV test pattern, randomly pulling at his dick.
     Walk by his window, he sees me, recognition kinks -- thinks
     this is a good sign...I shoot him right through the glass.


96   EXT. TUDOR MANSION - EARLY A.M.                           96

     Bradley, roused from sleep, silk robe, coming down the
     stairs, his back door wide open. Reaches the landing, turns
     on the light.

     Feature me, this bobble-eyed ghoul, bloodying his settee. I
     look like something exhumed. His monogrammed serving napkins
     soak up blood from my knifed side. He startles school-girl.
     Throw the file at his feet: marred, mangled, stained. He
     inches forward, cinching his robe.

                         BRADLEY
               Who?

                         ME
               Fritz Koenig.

                                                       120.



                      BRADLEY
                (going pale)
            Where?

                      ME
            Dead. Along with Wilhite,
            Junior...and Hector Magdalena.

                      BRADLEY
            Why are you here?

                      ME
            To collect. I have the things you
            need to destroy Noonan's play.
            These same things can be used to
            destroy you.

Bradley, prim, proper, even this early. He sits down across
from me like some fucking Duke.

                      BRADLEY
            Things like?

                      ME
            Stemmons files...and Wilhite's
            body. He committed suicide after
            you subpoenaed him.

                      BRADLEY
            This body is in your possession?

Just nod.

                      ME
            And it's what you need to burn
            Narco to the ground...but if those
            files and his body were to be given
            to Noonan and the Feds, with me
            providing the cherry-on-top
            testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The
            word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind.

                      BRADLEY
            What will this cost?

                      ME
            A percentage of your Dodger Stadium
            stake in perpetuity. You buy my
            silence for a fourth of Hurwitz
            Holdings.

Bradley scoffs, pithy smile.

                                                               121.



                           BRADLEY
               Doubtful.

                         ME
               What'd you expect? A stick-up?
               Empty your safe? I'm about to
               disappear for good, and you're
               gonna fund my new life. You can't
               counter-punch out of this. Arrest
               me and I snitch the world.
                   (point to the file)
               I'll hold that over your head for
               the rest of your life. Renege on
               our deal and it won't matter if
               it's tomorrow or ten years from
               now...I'll fry you with that file.
                   (at my cracked Hamilton)
               I'm officially outta time now
               Chief. Call it.

     Bradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic. His Adam's apple
     bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten.

                         BRADLEY
               Wilhite's body...Bury it.


97   INT. PETE'S CADILLAC - MORNING                               97

     Cruising up the Topanga Canyon. Almost home...

                         ME (V.O.)
               Shaking to see her, touch her...


98   EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING                                      98

     Door locked. Knocking. Pete opens up. Standing drunk. A
     pissed-off nod.


99   INT. BUNGALOW - NEXT MOMENT                                  99

     Liquor wafts off of him.

                         ME
               You go to bed drunk, or just been
               up all night.

     No answer as I follow him into the house.

                         KLEIN
               Where's Glenda, is she asle-

                                                       122.



-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go
pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look
back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with
a right cross.

                    ME (V.O.)
          Seen Pete do this a dozen times and
          every time the same thought: God
          help me if he ever hits me like
          that...

Instant-drop, moan. Glenda screaming.

                    ME (CONT'D)
          Don't kill me.

Pete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes.

                    MILTEER
          The harder you hit him the quicker
          I say `stop' -- and cease that
          absurd crying.

Pete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my
nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left
hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes.
Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything.

                    GLENDA BLEDSOE
              (at Milteer)
          THAT IMPOTENT SHIT-

                    MILTEER
          -touch me and he dies.

Pete knocks me down again. My face in pieces.

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)
          Kick him-kick him-kick him.

Pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3-

                    MILTEER (CONT'D)
              (prim, official)
          -you may stop.
              (beat, for the room)
          Howard determined that this was the
          price for your time together.

Milteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered
husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out:

                                                             123.



                          MILTEER
                You still have a job.

      Milteer gone. I spit volumes of blood. I'll talk with a slur
      for the next year. Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing.

                          PETE
                ...I'm sorry Dave...

      Pushing out words past shattered teeth.

                          ME
                I put you here...that Powerhawk-

                          PETE
                -there's a body in the trunk-

                             ME
                -burn it.

      Big drunk nod from Pete. Glenda panicking, trying to stanch
      blood that keeps rushing. Pete, reeling drunk, leans down,
      stuffs something in my jacket.

                          PETE
                I'm so sorry....


100   INT. SHOWER - TIME UNKNOWN                               100

      Steaming water. Almost painful. I sit in the tub, let the
      shower rain down. Drain floods diluted red. Wash my wounds,
      my soul. So many bruises I look bubonic. My face still
      swelling, already purple-black. My left eye more than swollen
      shut. On the other side of the curtain:

      Glenda naked. Beauty that catches in my chest. Try to stand,
      turn my destroyed face. She gently pushes me back down. Sits
      into me, holds my face in both hands so that the water hits
      my lips. No nerves, no unease. Home. She closes the curtain.


101   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     101

      Post-coital. Both wide awake. Still scared.

                          GLENDA
                Let me take you to a hospital.

                          ME
                We'd never make it inside.

                                                             124.



                          GLENDA
                    (big beat)
                I'm worried.

                          ME
                I'm through the worst of it.

      She frames my face with her hands.

                          GLENDA
                I don't believe you.

      Lies will only leak, expose. The silence makes me just as
      guilty. She lets me off the hook, her head on my arm, leaning
      in. I kiss her.

                          GLENDA (CONT'D)
                    (at a whisper)
                Was I worth this?

                          ME
                Whatever the cost.

                          GLENDA
                Just like that then?

                          ME
                Just like that.

      A nod. An understanding. Another kiss, the last one I'll
      remember.


102   INT. COLD WATER CANYON BUNGALOW KITCHEN - BLACK A.M.       102

      Head shaved. Stopped bleeding. You clearly see what my face
      will look like 25 years hence. Gauze over my left eye.
      Reading the Paper: my dress-blue photo, the one that looks
      nothing like me now. Headline:

                My deadline with Noonan: two days
                old. He and Bradley playing chess
                by press release.

                           ME (V.O.) (cont'd)
                Bradley relocates the deaths of
                Captain Fritz Koenig and Sergeant
                Richard Stemmons to Chavez
                Ravine...both given posthumous
                Medals of Valor. Junior dies a hero
                after all.

                Bradley's press fodder cast them as
                `outlaw cop and drug dealer' who
                most likely fled to Mexico. Narco
                under a full-blown, Bradley-led
                investigation.

103   INT. BEDROOM - BLACK A.M.                                  103

      Just sit and watch Glenda. Listen to her sleep: rhythmic
      breathing. The little natural smiling curl to her lips.
      Blonde hair splayed over white sheets. Touch her.

                          ME (V.O.)
                I haven't loved you long enough to
                leave it all behind...Too many
                enemies. Too many ways for you to
                get hurt. Too close to me...a
                decision that will haunt me the
                rest of my days...

      The Gillette knife, fold it in a kerchief, gift-wrap it to
      Glenda. Place a letter under it on the night stand:

                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                "My Heaven: the hours I had with
                you. My Hell: the years ahead,
                without. Someday I'll see you
                before you even know I'm looking."

                                                               126.



      I stand quiet, `grief' the best word but still not enough.
      Choke back tears as I lift Pete's camera and take the black
      and white picture you've seen before.

      Put my jacket on, pull the paper out of my pocket that Pete
      planted...a TWA Airline voucher. I smile small...

                                                     FLASHBACK TO:

                          PETE
                ...be nice to be in with a
                billionaire who's got a fleet of
                planes, fly you outta the country
                on short notice...

                                                       RETURN TO:


104   INT. LAX - MORNING                                          104

      A Times vending machine: paper blazing with front page photos
      of wanted cop Dave Klein. I walk right past my old face. Past
      Cops and Feds camped out, looking for me.

                           ME (V.O.)
                Pete's penance beating built me a
                brand new face...nobody gives me a
                second glance...not even the cops I
                recognize.

      Up to the TWA counter: glance up at the departures board-

      BLACK.

105   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                               105

      I'm old. Stare at my leather-tan, once-broken face in a
      gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed
      uneven. I start to pack my suitcases. Old files you think you
      may have seen before. An old gun you know you've seen before.
      Movements slow and steady in my advancing age...

                           ME (V.O.)
                My will to remember. My confession
                complete. Still not enough.
                    (beat)
                Post-scripts.

                                                       127.

                     ME (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Me: gringo exile rich off funds
          from Stadium Parking lots. Meg and
          Pete: still married. Three boys.
          Boyce Bradley: Lt. Governor, then a
          Gubernatorial primary loser to some
          chump who acted in Chimp movies.
          Welles Noonan, convicted of jury
          tampering in `64. Prison suicide in
          `66. Howard Hughes: a shut-in

          Vegas Hilton.
              (beat)
          George Ainge: body found, murder
          unsolved. Madge Magdalena, liver
          failure in `68. Lucille Magdalena:

Look back down at HER picture.

                      ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding
          her name. Only a photograph,
          yellowed with years-passed,
          reminding me of everything I never
          was.
               (beat)
          Then a week-old Times at the place
          I buy coffee. Her picture sees me
          before I realize she's looking. Her
          Face eternal-beautiful...

Put her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times
into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.

                    ME (V.O.)
          ...and it asked me to revoke our
          time apart, redeem it...tell her
          anything...tell her everything...

I stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And
as I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my
MGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.

1. COVERED RIDING SCHOOL OF THE MANORIAL ESTATE INT/DAY
MONTAGE OF CLOSE-SHOTS:

                                                                1

A man is riding a dressage horse. We can't see his face.
Only his boots, spurs, whip, the taut reins, the horse's
foamy mouth, the movements that steer the animal.
We watch him for a while and hear the SNORTS of the
horse, the dull SOUND of THE HOOVES on the ground, the
fast-uttered COMMANDS of the rider. Then we start to
hear a gentle voice:

       NARRATOR (o.s.):I don't know if the story that I
       want to tell you, reflects the truth in every
       detail. Much of it I only know by hearsay, and a
       lot of it remains obscure to me even today, and
       I must leave it in darkness. Many of these
       questions remain without answer. But I believe I
       must tell of the strange events that occurred in
       our village, because they may cast a new light
       on some of the goings-on in this country...

LONG SHOT OF THE RIDING STABLES.
The rider is the village doctor, a gaunt, intellectual-
looking man of around 60, who has finished his dressage
session, and now rides toward the open gate beside the
CAMERA, goes through it and into the landscape. We see
him in the avenue, now visible behind him, and watch him
grow smaller until he vanishes.



       NARRATOR (o.s. continuing):...Everything began,
       if I remember correctly, with the doctor's
       riding accident. After his dressage session in
       the manor's riding school, he was first headed
       for his home...


                            



2.   THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY

The garden opens up on the meadows and fields of the
flat countryside.

The doctor lies beside his wounded horse. His arm is
strangely twisted, his broken collarbone has made a bump
in the blood-drenched jacket. He yells with pain.

After a few moments Xenia, the doctor's 12-year old
daughter, comes running out of the house. She rushes up
to her father and looks at him, horrified, then at the
twitching horse, screams with horror. Her father shouts
something to her, she bends over him and tries to raise
him to his feet. He screams at her as he's in such pain.

She staggers back helplessly, he shouts something to her
again, whereupon she runs off. We hear all this from far
away, because during the whole scene the narrator has
continued his tale:
                                                           2

       NARRATOR: ...to see if any of his patients had
       arrived. As it entered the property, the horse
       had tripped over a hardly visible, taut wire
       that had been strung between two trees.
       The doctor's fourteen-year old daughter had
       watched the accident from the window of the
       house, and was able to inform the woman who was
       their neighbor, who in turn got the message to
       the manor house, so that the agonizing doctor
       could be transported to the hospital of the
       district capital that was over 30 kilometers
       away...

                            



3.   VILLAGE-STREET AND SCHOOL EXT/DAY

TRACKING SHOT:
Emilie Wagner, a skinny, modestly dressed woman in her
late thirties hurries along the village street.

       NARRATOR: ...The neighbor, a single woman of
       around 40, was the village midwife, who had
       filled the invaluable position of housekeeper
       and receptionist for the doctor since the death
       of his wife in childbirth.
       After tending to the doctor's two children, she
       had gone to the school to fetch her own son,
       Hans. Since she didn't like leaving him alone,
       she asked me - in return for a small fee - to
       keep him at the school with me every day, after
       the other children had finished their lessons.
       But on the day of the riding accident there was
       choir practice in the afternoon, so that most of
       the children were still present.

A few children pass Emilie and greet her. Then she
reaches the school. The door is open. The schoolchildren
stream out.

We see the schoolteacher, a slight man, hardly 30 years
old, talking inside to some of the older students.
Martin, a tall gangly boy of around 12, whose elegant
clothes make him stand out among the other children
coming out of the school, turns to the midwife:

        MARTIN: Were you at Xenia's place?
He's interrupted by Marie, a delicate, pretty and polite
girl of around 13 who has the odd characteristic of
already behaving like an adult.
        MARIE: Can't you say hello? Good afternoon, Mrs.
        Wagner, excuse me.
       MIDWIFE: Hello, Marie.
                                                           3

        MARIE: We're so worried, you know. That's why
        Martin forgot his manners.
        MIDWIFE: That's all right.
        MARIE: How is the Doctor?
        MIDWIFE: Not very well.
        MARIE: Will he have to stay in the hospital?
        MIDWIFE: I don't know.


The midwife is tired of Marie's precocious and endless
questions. She peers over the heads of children
surrounding them, looking for someone in the classroom.

        MARIE: We'll take care of Xenia. Maybe, we can
        help her somehow.
        MIDWIFE (distracted): Good idea. It'll cheer her
        up.
She has seen her son, who's coming out of the door: he
is a mongoloid boy of 8. His name is Hans. He hesitates,
as he sees his mother surrounded by the others. The
midwife leaves the group and goes over to him.
        MIDWIFE: Well, did you enjoy the singing?
        HANS (nods eagerly): It was great!
The schoolteacher comes in.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Show your mother what you've been
        singing.
Hans looks doubtfully, first at the schoolteacher, then
at his mother, who nods at him encouragingly. After
hesitating for a second, he starts to SING:


        HANS: La... La... lalala...
MARIE turns to leave.


        MARIE: Good-bye, Sir. Good-bye, Mrs. Wagner.
Her saying good-bye acts as an invitation to the other
children: they also SAY GOOD-BYE, though some less
distinctively, and follow the girl.
TRACKING SHOT with the children. After a short distance,
Georg, a strong boy of around 13, shouts, encouraging
the others:

        GEORG: Last one is a rotten egg!


                                                           4

Then he sprints off. Most of the children follow him.
But Marie and some of the other kids merely walk off at
a brisk pace.
The CAMERA, that stopped when Georg ran off, now FOLLOWS
Marie, so that, after a while, the others can be seen
again at the far end of the street.


                            



4.   THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAY
Xenia, who is herself in a pitiful condition, holds her
four-year-old brother Rudolph on her knees. She rocks
him and herself back and forth. As his head is bowed, we
can only guess that he's crying. After a while

        XENIA (quietly): If you want, I can cut out some
        animals for you, as I did last week?
No reaction.
        Would you like that?!
Rudolph shakes his head faintly.
        We could color them together, no?
No reaction.
        Or we could cut them from the lovely colored
        paper? The golden one, do you remember? The one
        I got for Easter?
No reaction. Xenia ends up pressing her head helplessly
against her little brother's head and mutters:
        Come on, come on.
They remain that way for a while. Finally Xenia raises
Rudolph high enough so she can stand up:

       All right! Now I'm going to make us something to
       eat. Mrs. Wagner has prepared everything, I...
       RUDOLPH (interrupts her softly, his head still
       bowed): What if he never comes back?
        XENIA (as if she hasn't understood): What?
Rudolph merely shakes his bowed head. Xenia kneels down
in front of her brother and tries to look into his eyes,
but the boy bows his head even deeper.

        XENIA (tenderly): Come on! Don't be stupid! It
        goes away just like the flu. Remember last
        winter? You were very sick, weren't you? And
        then, two weeks later...
A NOISE makes her cock her ear: it's as if something had
hit the window in the next room.
                                                           5

Xenia stands up and listens. SILENCE. And then, after
listening for a while, once again the same noise.
        XENIA: Hush!
She goes into the OTHER ROOM and, hiding behind the
curtain, looks out.
Outside, the group of children are gathered around
Marie. They look up at the house. They're waiting for
something.
After a while, Georg, the boy who earlier had urged them
to race, throws another stone at the window. Xenia is
startled. She hesitates. Finally, she opens the window.
        GEORG: Hi, Xeni!
Xenia doesn't answer. After a while
        MARIE(quietly): How are you? Can we help you?


                            

5.   MANOR EXT/NIGHT
The steward of the estate, a heavy set rustic man in his
mid fifties, is talking with the landowner (who's about
the same age). They are standing beside a team of
carthorses. With a torch the steward lights up a dead
horse that lies on the ground after being towed in by
the carthorses.
        STEWARD: ...its tendons were almost severed. It
        never would have recovered.
The landowner bends down and examines the wounds on the
pasterns of the dead animal's front legs.
        LANDOWNER: How did that thing get there? Didn't
        the Doctor say anything?
       STEWARD (with a snicker): He was in no mood to
       talk, with his collarbone sticking out of his
       throat. I asked his daughter. She has no idea.
       He always rides through those trees.
       LANDOWNER: Did you look at the wire?
       STEWARD: Of course. It's thin, but strong. You
       can hardly see it, if you don't look closely.
       LANDOWNER: But why was it tied there?
       STEWARD (shrugging): And at knee height! I don't
       know... Maybe so the kids could jump over it. No
       idea. I don't think the doctor himself was
       stupid enough to tie that thing there.
       LANDOWNER: Meaning?



                                                           6

       STEWARD: Meaning: I don't know. Anyway it was
       definitely put there intentionally and looks
       damn...


                            

6.   MANOR. LIVING ROOM ON THE TOP FLOOR. INT/NIGHT
Sigi, the 9-year old son of the landowner stands at the
window, and watches his father and the steward standing
in the torchlight beside the dead horse.
In the background MUSIC (Piano/violin).
After a short while the two men down in the courtyard
separate: the landowner heads to the manor, the steward
with the team of carthorses to a farm building.
Sigi turns away from the window and looks into the room.
There his mother Beatrix, a beautiful, nervous woman in
her late thirties, is sitting at a baby grand piano.
Beside her stands the tutor, holding a violin tucked
under his chin. He looks as if he's in his late
twenties, plump and slightly greasy, and obviously
infatuated with his beautiful employer, who has just
interrupted her playing with an annoyed sigh.
        TUTOR: I'm sorry, Madame. You're just playing
        too well for me.
       BEATRIX:   Stop  apologizing   and  concentrate.
       That'll be more helpful for both of us.
        TUTOR: To tell the truth: You're just playing
        too fast for me. I'm not Paganini.
Beatrix looks up at him with a quick amused smile, then
turns back the pages of her sheet music.
        BEATRIX: Well, let's start all over again at the
        letter D.
The tutor does the same, they glance at each other and
start again.
Sigi watches them from the window, then he saunters in,
stops some distance away and watches. Then he saunters
away again.
Suddenly, Beatrix stops playing again.
        BEATRIX: Listen, darling. If you like the music,
        then sit down beside me and turn the pages of
        the sheet music. But if you're bored, go up to
        your room and at least stay out of my sight. It
        makes me nervous if you're constantly sauntering
        around in front of me.
Sigi bows his head ashamed, but doesn't move.
        BEATRIX (turning to the tutor): By the way, what
        time is it? Where is the girl?
The tutor pulls out his pocket watch.

                                                           7

       TUTOR: She's with the twins, I presume. Twenty
       to nine.
       BEATRIX: Twenty to nine?! (turning to Sigi): You
       should have been in bed long ago. (to the
       tutor): Has he done his homework?
       TUTOR: Of course, Madame.
        BEATRIX: All right. (to Sigi): Well, do you want
        to turn the pages for me or not?
Sigi nods.
        BEATRIX: Then come here!
With a little caustic smile, she taps beside her on the
piano bench. Sigi comes over sits down beside her and
looks at the sheet music. Beatrix turns the pages back.
        BEATRIX (to the tutor): All right, here we go
        again: the letter D. Try to play a bit faster.
        Or else I might as well play with the village
        schoolteacher.
They PLAY again. Sigi reads the music with her, then
turns the page.


                            



7.   RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHT
Marie and Martin come through the door and stand in
front of it.
At the dinner table, the pastor (in his mid-forties)
sits with his back to the door. In front of him, at the
other end of the table, sits his wife Anna, a woman in
her late forties. On the sides of the table sit the
children:
Anton (11), Magdalena (10), Katharina (9) and Florian
(7). Two other places are empty.
The table is set for 8 people, but the plates are empty.
SILENCE.
         MARIE (quietly): Please forgive us.
        MARTIN (following her lead): Please forgive us.
SILENCE. Then the pastor speaks very quietly, without
turning to the two children:

       PASTOR: There's no question of forgiving. You
       haven't offended me. It's your mother and your
       brothers and sisters that you have frightened
       away and offended. Ask them for forgiveness.
       You amaze me. I didn't know that the two oldest
       and therefore most reasonable of my children
       wouldn't mind frightening their mother and
       brothers and sisters to death.
                                                           8

He turns around toward the two children:
        Are you now grown up enough to live on your own?
        Are you? Do you want to leave home and start a
        life of your own? So you can come and go as you
        please, and nobody gets in your way. Is that
        what you want?
The two remain silent, their heads bowed. The pastor
turns his back to them again, and faces the table.

       Nobody at this table has eaten tonight. When it
       grew dark, and you hadn't returned, your mother
       went all over the village in tears, looking for
       you. Do you really think we could've enjoyed our
       meal, if we feared something had happened to
       you?
       Do you think we can enjoy our meal now, when
       you've come back and dish up lies as an excuse?
       I don't know what's worse: your absence or your
       coming back. (PAUSE).
       Tonight we shall all go to bed hungry.

He stands up, followed by the mother and the children
who were sitting at the table. Again he turns to the two
wrongdoers:
        PASTOR: You probably agree with me, that I
        cannot leave your offense unpunished, if we want
        keep living in mutual respect. So, tomorrow
        evening at this hour, I shall give each of you
        10 strokes of the cane. Until then, you have
        time to ponder over your offense. Do you agree
        with me?
       MARIE and MARTIN: Yes, Father.
        PASTOR: All right then. Go to bed now, all of
        you.
The children who were sitting at the table go first to
their mother, then to their father. They kiss their
hands and leave the room. As Marie and Martin want to do
the same, the father says
        PASTOR: I refuse to be touched by you. Your
        mother and I will sleep poorly because we know I
        have to hurt you tomorrow, and because it will
        more painful to us than the strokes will be
        painful to you. Leave us alone and go to bed.
As the two children are about to leave the room, he says
        PASTOR: When you were small, your mother once in
        a while would tie a ribbon in your hair or
        around your arm. Its white color was to remind
        you of innocence and purity. I thought that at
        your age you were well-mannered enough to get by
        without such reminders. I was wrong. Tomorrow,
        once you've been purified by your punishment,
                                                           9

        your mother will tie such a ribbon on you again,
        and you'll wear it until your behavior shows us
        that we can trust you again.


                               



8.    THE DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY
CLOSE ANGLE: one of the trees to which the wire was tied
that tripped up the doctor's horse. A policeman is
looking for clues.
With him are Xenia, Rudolph, the midwife and her son
Hans.
The    two  boys   don't  show   much  interest  in   the
investigation. They run after each other in the garden
and the neighboring fields. Hans especially seems enjoy
this, and is shrieking with delight.
         POLICEMAN: Where is the wire now?
The midwife looks at Xenia, who shrugs her shoulders.
         POLICEMAN: Then who took it away?
        XENIA: I don't know.
        POLICEMAN: You weren't here?

Xenia, uncertain, looks at the midwife.

        POLICEMAN:   Did   you   accompany   your   father?   To
        town?
        XENIA: No.
        POLICEMAN: That means you were here.
        XENIA: I was in school. Today.
        POLICEMAN: And when you left for school, the
        wire was still here?
        XENIA: I didn't check.


The policeman turns to the midwife:

        POLICEMAN: And when did you come?
        MIDWIFE: At noon. I make lunch for the Doctor
        and the kids. Since the death of the Doctor's
        wife, I've been helping him out.
        POLICEMAN: Since when?


                                                                   10

        MIDWIFE: It's been 4 years. Since the birth of
        little Rudolph. I'm the midwife here. We often
        work together.
        POLICEMAN: But you didn't see anything?
        MIDWIFE: No.
        POLICEMAN: Do you have any idea how long the
        wire had been there?
        MIDWIFE: I'd never seen it before.
         POLICEMAN (angrily): Let me get this straight:
         Nobody saw the thing before, nobody saw it
         afterwards. It wound itself around the two trees
         all alone, and made itself vanish after the
         doctor's fall. Right?
Neither the midwife nor Xenia know what to answer. At
that moment Hans comes running in from the field,
excited:
         HANS: Mother! ... Look! ...Look... come!
        MIDWIFE (reluctantly): What's happening?
        HANS: People! ...Lots of people. Come!!
        MIDWIFE (to the policeman): Sorry...
Indeed, as the midwife sets outs for the field, a group
of people hurry along the path bordering the doctor's
property, and cross our POV. They carry a body on a
makeshift stretcher. The policeman and Xenia follow the
midwife. The group vanishes as quickly as it appeared
behind the surrounding bushes.
As the group was approaching, we have been hearing
        NARRATOR: The day following the doctor's riding
        accident not only brought no solution to the
        question of who'd done it, but a second, far
        more tragic incident almost made people forget
        the misfortune of the previous day: the wife of
        a tenant farmer died in a work-accident.


                            



9.   FARM INT/DAY
It's very dark in the low-ceilinged room. Small windows.
A couple of women in peasant dresses take care of the
dead woman, who's been laid out on the bed. The women
remove her clothes and wash her.
        NARRATOR: The woman, who because of an injured
        arm could only do light work, had been dispensed

                                                            11

         by the steward from harvesting chores, and was
         assigned to easier work in the sawmill.
Everything happens very silently. An elderly woman, a
midwife specialized in bathing, takes care of the
proceedings.
Every time the door is opened, one hears the mutterings
of the people waiting outside. Soiled water is carried
out, new underwear brought in, and the women start to
clothe the naked corpse again.
Outside, the sounds of excited VOICES are getting
louder. Then the door opens and the farmer (around
fifty) enters the room. The old midwife turns around
angrily:
         BATHING-MIDWIFE: You stay outside! I haven't
         yet...
        FARMER (quietly): Get out!
Reluctantly, the old midwife abandons her half completed
work, not without having spread the dress she had draped
over the still half-naked body of the dead woman. The
other women follow her, embarrassed.
Once the door has closed behind them, the farmer just
stands there. Only after a long while does he move
forward and sit beside his dead wife. He remains seated,
motionless. For a very long time. He only tugs once at
the dress draped over the half-naked body, as if he
wanted to cover a patch of nudity. Then he just sits
there again in the dark room, and only his halting
breath lets us know that any moment he may cry.


                            



10. A RIVER AND MEADOW WITH BRIDGE EXT/DAY
With his net and his fishing rod the schoolteacher is
landing a fish.
        NARRATOR: On the same day, I had a strange
        encounter: the weather was beautiful and hot, so
        I decided to try and improve my meager menu with
        some brown trout, which are plentiful in the
        river. The landowner apparently liked me, and
        allowed me to fish.
Suddenly, the schoolteacher stops dead: like a tightrope
walker Martin is walking along on the top of the wall of
the bridge, thirty feet above the riverbed.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (shouts, fearful): Martin!
The boy doesn't seem to hear him and keeps up his
balancing act.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (louder): Martin!!
The boy keeps at it.

                                                           12

The schoolteacher quickly wades ashore, throws his
fishing rod and the net and the wriggling fish on the
gravel beside the river and climbs up the river bank.
When he gets on top, he sees the boy balancing himself
at the other end of the bridge.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Martin, be careful!
The boy takes a few more steps, then reaches the end of
the wall and jumps down onto the bridge. Hesitatingly,
he turns to the schoolteacher, who comes toward him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you completely insane? ! Do
        you want to break your neck? !
        MARTIN (his head bowed): Hello, sir.
The schoolteacher has reached him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's happening? Are you mad? !
        Don't you know how high that is?
The boy remains silent, keeping his head bent down.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Didn't you hear me? I shouted to
        you.
         MARTIN (after a short silence): Yes, I did.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?
The boy remains silent.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?!!
Keeping his head bowed, the boy shrugs a little. The
schoolteacher, realizing that this won't get him any
further, tries again, talking in a gentle voice:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: You saw me down there and wanted
        to impress me?
The boy shakes his head.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, why didn't you...
         MARTIN   (interrupting  him) I  gave  God  an
         opportunity to kill me. He didn't do it. That
         means, he's pleased with me.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (staggered): What are you saying?
         MARTIN: He doesn't want me to die.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (bewildered):   Who?   Who   doesn't
         want you to die?
         MARTIN: God.
Pause.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why would God want you to die?
The boy stops answering, his head bowed again. The
schoolteacher remains silent and looks at him for a
while. Then, he adds softly:

                                                              13

        Promise me never to do such nonsense again. All
        right? Look at me.
Martin looks up reluctantly.
        Promise it to me.
Martin remains silent. He doesn't dare look down, and
instead looks past the schoolteacher.
        You don't trust me, don't you?
        MARTIN (polite, emotionless): Yes, I do, Sir.
The schoolteacher realizes that there's no use in
talking any further.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (concluding): All right. Go home
        now. I'll be coming tomorrow for the piano
        lesson. I'll talk to your father then.
Martin turns and faces the schoolteacher, and says in
such a pleading voice that it startles him:
        MARTIN: Please, don't tell him! Please, sir,
        don't!
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why?
Martin just looks pleadingly at the schoolteacher and
shakes his head, as if to stress his request.

                            


11. SAWMILL INT/DAY
Franz, the farmer eldest son, is searching for evidence
of his mother's accident. He is accompanied by the
neighbor's son Matti, a slight boy of around 16.
The sawmill is a ramshackle wooden building beside the
river.
Matti, who obviously was there when the accident
happened, shows Franz the place.
        MATTI: There. Be careful. Everything's rotten
        here.
Franz moves slowly forward. He looks down at the lower
floor. Immediately below: the saw. Franz steps back
carefully and turns to Matti:
        FRANZ: Who made her climb up here?
       MATTI: I haven't a clue. They told us to collect
       all the lose ends. She just climbed up there.
       FRANZ: She could never stand heights. It made
       her dizzy.
       Who assigned you to this job?
       MATTI (uneasy): You know how it works. The
       sawmill needed to be cleaned up, and the foremen
       pick the weaker harvesters
                                                          14

        FRANZ: Who picked her?


                               

12. STREET AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE EXT/DAY
.
The schoolteacher with his fishing gear and several fish
that he caught.
        NARRATOR: It was on my way home after the
        strange encounter with Martin that I met Eva for
        the first time.
Eva (18), a redhead, somewhat chubby, but pretty girl,
crosses him way on her bicycle. A big bag is strapped to
the baggage carrier.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello.
        EVA (passing by): Hello.
The schoolteacher stops, turns to the girl:
        SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitantly): Excuse me!
        EVA (Off): Yes?
        SCHOOLTEACHER   (embarrassed):  Excuse   me   for
        accosting you this way. You're the new nanny of
        the Baron's children, aren't you?
We hear the bicycle stopping.
        EVA (o.s.): Why?
The schoolteacher has turned around and now moves toward
the girl.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: They say you're from Oberdorf.
        EVA: Who says that?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Folks around here.
        EVA: Oh. So what?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I don't know. Sorry. I'm
        the schoolteacher here. I just thought I... I
        don't know (he laughs embarrassed): when I saw
        you, I thought... I'm from Grundbach... I'm the
        tailor's son...
        EVA: I know.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (confused): What?
        EVA: The Baroness already told me.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What did she tell you?


                                                            15

       EVA: That the schoolteacher is from the village
       next to mine.
       SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): Oh, I see! Yes. Well...
       I thought... (he points at the bag on the
       baggage carrier): You look as if you're going
       there...
       EVA: Where?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Back home. To Oberdorf.
       EVA (doesn't understand what he's referring to):
       Yes?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Are you going there?
       EVA: Yes, I am.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (doesn't know what to say): Well,
        I thought... since you'll cycle through our
        village... you might perhaps...(he's thinking,
        looks down and sees the fish): ... say hello to
        my father and (laughing at his own idea, he
        holds up a fish) bring him one of the fishes.
        They're fresh. I just caught them.
Now Eva laughs too.
        EVA: What?!
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling as if to apologize):
        Well. I'm sure he'd be delighted. Especially as
        it's the start of the weekend.
She nods at the fish. The absurdity of the suggestion
amuses her. At the same time she doesn't really know how
to behave.
        EVA: Well, how...
The schoolteacher holds up the fish, laughs, as if he
himself doesn't how he got this idea.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:    I     don't    know    either.
        Unfortunately, I have nothing to wrap them in.
The both laugh. Pause. Then the girl points at the bag
on the baggage carrier of her bicycle and says
regretfully:
        EVA: Neither have I. Unfortunately.
The schoolteacher has a new "idea ":
        SCHOOLTEACHER ("amused"): I could give you some
        fishing line, to tie them up.
        EVA (equally amused): There on the bicycle?!
The schoolteacher shrugs his shoulders with a smile
("why not").
        EVA: I don't think that's a very good idea.

                                                           16

         SCHOOLTEACHER:    You're   right.   It   was   just   an
         idea.
        EVA: Yes.
Embarrassed pause. Then
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that your bicycle?
         EVA ("What an idea!"): No! It belongs to the
         estate.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I see.
Pause.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Is this your first day off?
         EVA (rather suspicious because all this is too
         intimate for her): Yes.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, you're         probably   looking
         forward to being at home.
         EVA: Yes, I am.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I can imagine.
Pause. Then
        EVA says (putting the pedals and handlebar in a
        "ready to leave" position): Well. I've still a
        long way to go.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (stepping back): Of course. Well,
         good-bye.
        EVA: Good-bye.
She's about to ride off.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (with a smile): If you cycle
        through Grundbach and see my father, at least
        say hello to him from me.
         EVA: I don't know your father.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true.
They look at each other for a while and then Eva rides
off. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her. Eva and the bicycle are
tottering a bit. The girl looks around and shouts,
laughing:
        EVA: I only learned to ride a bicycle today!
         SCHOOLTEACHER (now o.s., also shouting): Well,
         you're doing fine! But be careful!
         As she picks up speed, Eva rides better and soon
         is just a speck on the dusty country road.
                              


                                                                    17

13. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DUSK
It's still too early to switch on the light.
Xenia and little Rudolph are sitting in the kitchen,
eating. For quite a while. Suddenly
        RUDOLPH: The woman today. What was wrong with
        her?
        XENIA (eating): Which woman? Oh, I see. She was
        dead.
Pause. Then
        RUDOLPH: What's that?
        XENIA: What?
        RUDOLPH: Dead.
Xenia looks up from her meal.
        XENIA: What's dead? My God, that's when someone
        doesn't live anymore. When he's stopped living.
SILENCE. Then
        RUDOLPH: When does one stop living?
Xenia looks up from her meal again. Now she tries to
talk more seriously to her brother because she
understands that these questions matter to him. But
she's also feeling uneasy and put on.
        XENIA: When you're too old or very ill.
        RUDOLPH: And the woman?
        XENIA: She had an accident.
        RUDOLPH: An accident?
        XENIA: Yes. That's when you hurt yourself very
        badly.
        RUDOLPH: Like Dad?
        XENIA: Yes, but much worse than that. So bad,
        that your body can't take it anymore.
        Another SILENCE: Then
        RUDOLPH: And then you're dead?
        XENIA: Yes.      But   most   people   don't   have   an
        accident.
        RUDOLPH: That means they don't need to die?
        XENIA: No, they die much later.
        RUDOLPH: When?
        XENIA: Later, when they're very old.
Long PAUSE.
                                                                   18

       RUDOLPH: Do all people die?
       XENIA: Yes.
       RUDOLPH: All of them, really?
       XENIA: Yes, everyone dies.
       RUDOLPH: But not you, Xeni?
       XENIA: Me too. Everyone.
       RUDOLPH: But not Dad?
       XENIA: Dad too.
       RUDOLPH: Me too?
       XENIA: You too. But not before a very very long
       time. All of us, only in a very long time.
       RUDOLPH: And you can't do anything against it?
       It has to happen?
        XENIA: It has to happen. But not now, not for a
        very long time.
Long PAUSE. Then
        RUDOLPH: And Mom? She didn't go on a trip?
PAUSE.
        RUDOLPH: Is she dead too?
PAUSE.
        XENIA: Yes. She's dead too. But that was a long
        time ago.
Both remain SILENT. In the meantime it has grown dark in
the kitchen.
Suddenly, Rudolph brushes away his plate off the table
with an angry movement, and turns away from Xenia. The
plate shatters on the floor.
At first Xenia is stunned, paralyzed. Then she starts to
sob, but tries to hide it from her brother.

                             

14. RECTORY. DINING ROOM. INT/NIGHT
While we hear the SOUNDS of the punishment and the
children being beaten, COUNTING the strokes with
increasing MOANS and stifled WHINING, we see (CLOSE
ANGLES) the faces of the other brothers and sisters.
Some have turned away their faces, and others start to
cry with pity and fear.
Finally both have received their 10 strokes.
CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor. He is breathless and beads of
sweat on his forehead.
        PASTOR: There.

                                                           19

He hands Martin the cane. CLOSE ANGLE: Martin.
        Here, take the cane and put it back in its
        place.
As Martin is about to go, his father goes on:
        But first you can thank me for trying to protect
        you from any further misconduct.
        CLOSE ANGLE: Marie.
        You know how much I love you and how much it
        hurts me to inflict such pain on you. Today was
        a very sad day in my life, and I hope for all of
        us that it doesn't happen again.
        CLOSE ANGLE: Both kiss their father's hand.
        CLOSE ANGLE: The pastor.
        PASTOR (smiles): And now hug me. There's nothing
        we have to forgive each other anymore. I love
        you with all my heart.
He first hugs Marie who, her face still wet with tears,
tries a forced smile and then Martin. Then, the pastor
turns to his wife:
        PASTOR: Now the ribbon, Anna.
Anna goes toward the two children, tying a white ribbon
around Martin's upper arm and another in Marie's hair.
        PASTOR: This will remain on you until we're all
        sure you have learned how to fight bad thoughts
        and manners. You're well aware, this year you
        will receive Christ's body in the form of bread
        and wine. Until then, strive to be free of
        sinful thoughts. Now let's eat.
Martin carries the cane out of the room. The pastor and
the other children sit around the table. Marie leaves
the room with her mother. After all the others have sat
down and put their plates back where they were before
the punishment, the two come back with two soup bowls
and put them on the table. Martin has also come back and
sits down at his place beside his father.
The pastor folds his hands in prayer, the others follow
suit.
        PASTOR (very friendly): Marie, would you say
        grace today?
        MARIE (smiling eagerly): With pleasure, father.
She bows her head, so do the others.
        MARIE: Come Lord Jesus and be our guest
        And bless what you've given to us.
        PASTOR: Amen. Blessed be this meal.
        THE OTHERS: Blessed be this meal.
                                                           20

The mother and Marie open the soup tureens and hand out
the soup. Then they eat.

                               

15. FARM INT/NIGHT
The body of the farmer's wife has been laid out. The
candles to its left and right are almost burnt out.
Its very quiet.
Little five-year old Sepp sneaks into the room, bare-
foot and wearing a shirt. He hesitates. Then, slowly and
carefully, he comes over to his dead mother. He ends up
standing beside the bed. The face of the dead woman is
covered with a white handkerchief.
Sepp is very frightened. He makes several attempts
before he dares to lift the handkerchief. Then he
watches her, breathless, his eyes and mouth wide open.
Suddenly, startled by a noise, he jerks back. He turns
around: his 14-year old brother Paul is sitting on a
bench against the wall. He too only wears a shirt.
        SEPP (surprised, with a whispering voice):
        Pauli?!
Paul doesn't say a word. Sepp doesn't know what to do.
He looks at his mother again, then again at his brother.
He goes over to him and sits beside him on the bench.
Like birds in a cage, they remain seated in the dark.
Very close together.

                               

16. ESTATE. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. BEDROOM.
INT/NIGHT
The steward and his children Liesl (15), Georg and
Ferdinand (10)] are waiting for something. Then the door
opens and the midwife comes out. She tells them to come
into the other room.
        NARRATOR: That night, the wife of the steward
        gave birth to her fourth and last child at the
        age of 42.
The children want to follow their father. At least
Liesl, a chubby and good-natured teenager, rather plain,
can't wait to go in. But the midwife tells them to be
patient, and only the father is let through.
        LIESL (burning with curiosity): What is it?
       MIDWIFE (smiling): Well, what do you think?
       LIESL(shakes   her   head   impatiently):   I   don't
       know.
       MIDWIFE: It's a boy.
       FERDINAND: Oh God!


                                                               21

       MIDWIFE: What do you mean?! Don't you want a
       brother?
       FERDINAND: Pff!
        MIDWIFE: You're lucky your father can't hear
        you.
Instead of the father, Georg hits his brother on the
back of the head. They quarrel.
        MIDWIFE: Stop that!
She steps in and distributes a few smacks. Liesl runs
out of the room howling.
        MIDWIFE: You should be ashamed.
        FERDINAND (Suddenly, as if he'd become another
        person): Sorry.
The midwife looks at him, confused.

                            


17. TRACK NEAR THE FARM EXT/DAWN
The farmer, Franz and Paul leave the farm, they go to
work. The two oldest carry scythes.
In the background vast fields of crops.
The three walk hurriedly. After a while
        FRANZ (hesitantly): Father, I have to tell you
        something.
       FARMER: What is it?
        FRANZ: I went to the sawmill.
The farmer keeps on walking as if he hasn't heard. Franz
looks at him from the side. For a long moment he remains
silent, while all three keep walking. Then, Franz goes
on softly:
        The floor, on the first level, where mother
        worked, was totally rotten.
They keep on walking.
        The steward, who sent her there, must have known
        it. And the landowner too.
The farmer remains silent. They keep walking.
        Father?!
       FARMER (hostile): What do you want?
        FRANZ (doesn't understand his father's refusal):
        They sent her there knowing it was dangerous.
The farmer stops, turns to Franz:
        FARMER (aggressive): What are you getting at?
       FRANZ (doesn't understand): But...
                                                           22

         FARMER (furious, but with forced calm): Do you
         want me to sue the Baron? Or kill the steward?
         FRANZ: I...
        FARMER: Go and cut off his head of with your
        scythe. Sure, that'll bring your mother back to
        life.
He turns away from Franz and keeps on walking. The
others follow. After a few steps
        FRANZ (softly): I think our father loved our
        mother.
Suddenly the farmer stops and screams, almost crying
with fury and despair:
        FARMER: Shut up!
CLOSE ANGLE: Paul. He was listening carefully the whole
time. He looks at the father. Then, lowers his eyes.
        NARRATOR: After these two days in July, life in
        the village returned to what it had always
        been...


                             


18. MONTAGE EXT/INS./DAY/NIGHT
a) Harvesting. Even teenagers and children are used to
tie the sheaves and to do other easier jobs.
        NARRATOR: ... The daily harvesting drove the
        people almost to exhaustion. Most of the
        children were busy helping their parents.

b) The midwife is doing housework in the Doctor's house.
A quarrel between her retarded son and the 4-year old
Rudolph (that we barely can follow due to the Narrator's
voice, o.s.) is settled by the midwife in favor of her
son.
        For the time being, the doctor remained in the
        hospital. In the meantime the midwife catered
        the basic needs of Xenia and Rudolph, his two
        children. After the burial of the farmer's wife,
        that was attended by the whole village, the two
        accidents were soon forgotten...


                             

19.   MANOR EXT/DAY
         NARRATOR: ... until the harvest festival at the
         end of the summer brought the whole village

                                                           23

        together again, first in a festive hustle and
        bustle, and then in horror and perplexity.

The courtyard is full of people, dressed in their Sunday
best:   Farmers,  seasonal-workers,   people  from   the
village, children and teenagers.
A dance hall has been set up. On it we see the
landowner, the steward and the pastor with their
families.
A couple of younger women, a delegation of the
harvesters, goes over to present the harvest crown to
the landowner.

        HARVESTER: ...with our songs and our prayers
        We've gathered the rye
        and given that crown to your lordship.
        It is not big, it is not small,
        But pretty, nice and fine.
        Not with thistles or thorns is it made,
        but with pure grain.
        Had our lordship sowed more,
        The men would've scythed more
        And we girls gathered more.
        We girls have gathered the grain,
        Over mountains and valleys,
        Over thistles and thorn,
        Over the fields of our lordship.
        I wish our lordship a happy life,
        As many years as there's sand on the beach
        As many years as there are drops in the rain
        So much may our lordship be blessed.
        And as a reward to be of good cheer
        We'd like for our folks a barrel of beer,
        And if we could have a fried goose perchance
        Then we'll all be ready to dance.
During the poem, the camera has shown all those we have
met until now. They have all ( except for the Doctor,
the farmer and his two eldest sons) come to the feast.
While all the folks present LAUGH and SHOUT, the maid,
with a clumsy curtsy, hands over the harvest crown to
the Baron. The village band plays a fanfare.
As soon as the hullabaloo has died down
        BARON(answering): My thanks to all of you. Thank
        you very much. You have worked well and the
        heavens were merciful, and now the barns are
        full.
         Therefore there's more than enough beer, and you
         won't starve today.
He points to the open barn, where food and beer are
waiting. In front of the barn are tables with long
benches.
         BARON: Enjoy your meal!! Eat and drink as much
         as you wish. You deserve it.
                                                            24

Again the people YELL and CHEER. Then, the MUSIC starts
and the feast is off and running.

                            


20. VEGETABLE GARDEN OF THE MANOR EXT/DAY
The vegetable garden is at the back of the manor house.
In the distance we hear the MUSIC from the feast.
Franz, in working clothes, comes over, opens a gate in
the fence, then goes to a large field with the cabbages
and slices them all off with his scythe. The whole scene
looks like a mass execution.

                            


21. ESTATE EXT/DAY
The party is in full swing: people dance and shout,
children run around, young men quarrel and show off in
front of the young girls. Older women are stand around
in groups, gossiping. Some farmers are gathered around
the landowner ­ he is friendly with them, but we don't
understand what they're talking about.
His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place
in this crowd. She's talking to the schoolteacher.
        BEATRIX: ...didn't you promise us a little
        chorale sung by your protégés.
       SCHOOLTEACHER: You have to talk to the pastor,
       Baroness. We're still busy studying the choir
       pieces for the confirmation feast.
       BEATRIX (amused): But that's in spring, my dear.
       This is the start of autumn.
       SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles, embarrassed): I know, but
       unfortunately not all of our little singers are
       very musical. I'm sorry if...


                            


22. ESTATE. UNDER THE LIME TREE . EXT/DAY
A quieter part of the estate.
Under a big shadowy tree, we see the two strollers of
the landowner's family, a small table and a few chairs.
Eva is sitting beside the twins and watches the colorful
bustle. Sitting beside her, turning her back to the
manor, is Emma, the steward's wife who is breastfeeding
her baby.
The steward separates from a group of men and comes over
to the two women. As he comes over, he shouts to them:


                                                           25

        STEWARD: Well, you two "mothers"? Don't you want
        to be part of the festivities?
Eva looks at the steward's wife, not knowing, how to
react to the "mother joke". But the slightly naive wife
of the steward is basically fond of any jokes her
husband cracks. She turns halfway to him and says:
        EMMA: It's so nice here in the shade.
In the meantime the steward has come over. He's smoking
a pipe.
        STEWARD (in excellent mood): Well, our son seems
        to be enjoying that, right?!
       EMMA: Yes.
       STEWARD: I can imagine. Who wouldn't like that.
       EMMA (rebuking him gently): Georg!
       STEWARD (to Eva): What about you? Don't you get
       bored taking care of other people's children,
       with all the young lads over there?
        EVA (uneasy, with forced sweetness): No Sir, I
        love to be with the children.
He gives his wife a short glance, then sits on a chair
beside Eva:
        How old are you anyway?
       EVA: Eighteen, Sir.
       STEWARD: Eighteen! And you want me to believe
       you'd rather hold the Baroness's baby in your
       arms than your true love?
       EMMA (good-naturedly): Come on, Georg, leave her
       alone.
       STEWARD: I'm not doing her any harm. Can you get
       us something to eat, Emma?
       EVA (stands up, to Emma): If you mind the
       children for a moment, I'll get us something.
       STEWARD (stands up too): Don't worry, princess,
       I'm going. Not to panic.


                            

23. ESTATE. THE PATH LEADING TO THE VEGETABLE GARDEN.
EXT/DAY
A bunch of children between 5 and 15, dressed up in
their Sunday best, among them Marie and Martin, both
wearing  their  white  ribbons,  the  pastor's  other
                                                           26

children, Xenia, Rudolph as well as Hans, Liesl, Georg,
Ferdinand and Sigi. They leave the manor and head toward
the fields. As they pass by the vegetable garden, they
notice the sliced off cabbages and stop. Some laugh at
it, others are unsettled. Most of the children keep run
on out into the open fields.

                            


24. ESTATE. OUTSIDE THE BARN. EXT/DAY
Farmhands and tenant farmers are eating at the tables.
One of them tells a story, that we only partially
understand because of all the noise:
        FIRST TENANT FARMER: ...so the guy really tried
        to steal the rooster from the steeple. He was
        already completely pickled, but even then they
        couldn't stop him. A huge, massive guy, you see.
        So they just let him go, saying to themselves:
        if he falls down, he falls down, that's it. But
        he didn't get much farther than the first
        window, that's where the trellis ends, see. And
        even with all his strength, he couldn't hoist
        himself up on the lightning rod. So the guy
        stands up there in the window. And what do you
        think that idiot does: he starts to crow! He
        crows, shouting: I'm the rooster on the steeple.
        You'll never catch me! He made such a commotion
        that little by little the people in the
        neighborhood started to wake up...
At the same time someone else starts to shout, causing
the others to join in:

       FARMHANDS and FARMERS:
       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down, hurray!
       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down.
       Has the landlord hung himself,
       that he doesn't serve me any beer?
       More beer, more beer, or I'll fall down!

Laughter. Leni, Franz's sister, and another farmgirl do
their best to cater to the drinker's thirst as fast as
possible. The two young women try to keep their spirits
up, but the guest's indelicate jokes and rude gestures
don't make it easy.

       LENI: I'm coming. I haven't got a magic wand.
       FIRST FARMHAND (with a grin): Shall I help you,
       Leni? I'd love to help you.
        SECOND FARMHAND (also grinning): What do you
        want to help her with?!
LAUGHTER.
        FIRST FARMHAND: All over. Front and backside.
                                                           27

More LAUGHTER.
        THIRD FARMHAND (to Leni): Are you as slow with
        the Baron?
         SECOND TENANT FARMER: Come on, leave her alone
         SECOND FARMHAND: You like her that much? Go and
         help her.
        FOURTH FARMHAND (sitting beside the second,
        almost in a whisper): Don't you know: it was her
        mother who had that accident?...
At the same time a boy of ten comes over to the first
farmer and butts in to his story:
        BOY: Father, they cut off the Baron's cabbages.
         FIRST TENANT FARMER: What's that?
        BOY (grin): They cut off the Baron's cabbages.
Leni, who's just putting some glasses with beer on the
table, glares at the boy, flabbergasted.

                             



25.   ESTATE. DANCE FLOOR. EXT/DAY

On the dance floor, Eva and the schoolteacher try to
dance. Neither is very talented. Eva keeps looking at
her feet and smiles, embarrassed.
        EVA: I never learned it.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (also with a smile): Neither did
        I. You just have to count out loud. One. Two.
        Three. One. Two. Three. One...
Their steps are far too big. They look clumsy and
embarrassed, but happy. After a few spins
        EVA: Aren't you afraid your students might laugh
        at you, when they see you dancing with me that
        way, sir.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (laughs): They'd better not! And
        stop being so formal with me. I'm not that old,
        am I?
Eva laughs, embarrassed and looks down.
        EVA: One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two.
        Three. One. Two. Three.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: You see: we're getting better.
         EVA: Well.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop looking at your feet.
                                                           28

She lifts her head, looks at him and... stumbles. They
laugh and start again.

                            


26. VEGETABLE GARDEN EXT/DAY
MUSIC of the village band can be heard coming from the
manor.
The Baroness reaches the vegetable garden, followed by
the pastor's wife, the tutor and some "ladies" from the
village. Behind the fence, among the "beheaded" cabbages
are the Baron, the steward and some farmers. A couple of
curious onlookers have gathered by the fence. Mutters,
and now and then laughter.
The Baron turns to his wife and, with a snicker, points
to the "heads" lying around him.
        BARON: Quite a job, isn't it?!
The Baroness looks at the extent of the disaster. Then
says, revolted:
        BARONESS: This is disgusting.
The steward comes over to them and, with a little grin,
comments on the sensitivity of his masters:
        STEWARD: It used to be an old custom (he
        quotes):
        "Now that the harvesting's done,
        "It's time to pay us, every one,
        "Any miser who leaves us in a rut,
        "He shall have his cabbage cut.

The Baroness, who doesn't think the symbolic character
of the deed is funny at all, looks briefly at him and
then back again at the cabbage cemetery. Suddenly, she
turns away and leaves the scene headed toward the manor.
She makes her way through the bystanders, who step aside
to let her through.

                            


27. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DUSK
The pastor works at his desk. Suddenly a KNOCK on the
door
        PASTOR (looking up): Come in
Florian comes hesitantly through the door.
        PASTOR: What do you want?
       FLORIAN (shy, almost frightened): I'd like to
       ask you something, Father.
       PASTOR: Yes?


                                                           29

The boy comes over to the desk, opens a few buttons of
his shirt and then seizes something inside. In the open
shirt we see the head of a little bird.
        PASTOR: So what?
        FLORIAN: I have found it. It's wounded.
Short PAUSE.
        PASTOR: What do you want?
         FLORIAN (pleadingly): May I keep it?
Short pause. The pastor is moved by the request of his
youngest    son,  but   manages  to   hide   his emotion
skillfully.
         PASTOR: How do you plan to do that?
       FLORIAN: We'll heal it.
        PASTOR (softly): And when it's healed?
Florian looks at him with round eyes, he doesn't know
what to answer. The pastor continues:
        Don't you think, you'll be attached to it then?
        Will you let it fly away?
Florian thinks, then nods toward a cage behind the desk.
        FLORIAN: "Pipsi" also lives in a cage.
The pastor looks at the cage shortly, hides a smile and
turns to Florian again:

        PASTOR: Yes, but Pipsi grew up in captivity.
        (nodding at Florian's bird): This one is used to
        living in freedom.
Florian doesn't know what to answer. So he merely looks
at his father with pleading eyes.
        PASTOR (repeats): Will you set him free, as soon
        he's healed?
Florian, looks down and nods with a heavy heart.
        PASTOR: Have you already asked Mother?
Florian nods eagerly.
        PASTOR: And? What did she say?
       FLORIAN: She said, it was for Father to decide.
        PASTOR (smiling faintly): That's what she said?
Florian nods eagerly and looks at his father with eyes
that are pleading with expectation.
        PASTOR: You'll really to take care of it? That's
        a heavy responsibility. You know that, don't
        you?
Sensing that his father is not quite against it, Florian
nods eagerly.
                                                           30

        PASTOR: Well. You're its father and mother now.
Florian nods yet more eagerly, if that's possible. The
pastor finds it difficult not to smile:
        We'll have to find a cage for your patient.
Florian can hardly believe it. He'd like to fling his
arms around his father's neck, but doesn't dare. So he
just keeps standing there, beaming.
        FLORIAN: Thanks, Father!

                            



28. TRACK TO THE FARM EXT/DUSK
Leni comes along the track, excited. She`s almost
running. She reaches the farm and disappears inside.

                            

29. FARM. ROOM. INT/DUSK
The family is eating. They're in working clothes, since
they didn't attend the Thanksgiving feast. Only Leni,
who visibly just came into the room, is still wearing
the clothes she wore at the feast. She's out of breath
and very excited. The farmer looks very concerned.
        FARMER (to Franz): Is that true?
       FRANZ (hostile, keeps on eating): I don't know
       nothing.
       FARMER (threatening): Is ­ that - true?!
       FRANZ (looks at him, aggressively): Nothing is
       true! And even if it was true, so what?! Serves
       him right, that miser!
        FARMER (trying to control himself): Did you do
        it, or did you not do it?
Franz doesn't answer and keeps on eating.
        LENI: It seems somebody saw you.
For a moment Franz remains calm, then he bursts out:
        FRANZ (to Leni): So what? They should be glad
        that they still have their own heads.(to the
        farmer) And I want you to know this, Father: I'm
        proud of it!
The father responds to this by slapping his face hard.
Franz jumps up.
        FARMER (orders Franz without looking at him):
        Sit down!
For a moment, we don't know how Franz will behave.
Sitting on the corner bench, he's jammed between his
                                                           31

father and his brothers and sisters, who stare at the
table, embarrassed. Only Paul, who sits opposite his
brother, looks up at him.
Franz finally sits down again. SILENCE. The farmer
stares at his plate, tries to speak softly, which is
obviously difficult for him, to judge by the sound of
his voice.
        FARMER: What did you intend to do?
As Franz doesn't answer, he looks up, right into Franz's
face, who avoids his father's eyes.
        FARMER: Well?
        FARMER: Tell me.
Franz keeps on glaring straight ahead. The farmer adopts
a gentler tone.
        Come on. Tell me:
       FRANZ (who   can   hardly   speak):   You   know   why,
       Father.
        FARMER (after a pause): Because of your mother?
        Because you feel they're responsible for her
        death? Is that it? What do you think? That I'm
        not man enough to settle this? It's that what
        you think?
Franz keeps on glaring, remaining silent. The father
tries to stay calm, staring straight ahead. He takes a
spoon and eats twice from the milk soup. He puts down
the spoon, and looks at Franz again.


       Did you ever think of what your behavior can
       mean for the whole family? If Leni loses her
       job, which enables us to keep our heads above
       water for the whole year? What if we can't work
       there anymore during the summer?

Franz makes an impatient movement, takes raises            his
spoon and wants to go on eating. The farmer grabs          his
arm and slams it down. The two stare at each other.        For
a moment, we don't know what will happen. Then             the
farmer goes on:


       You want to marry and take over the farm in two
       years? Yes? And how will you feed them all (he
       points with his head at the other children)
       without the help of the manor, tell me?

Franz turns his head away. He disagrees, but does not
know what to answer. The farmer goes on:


                                                                 32

        And how do you know they're responsible?

Franz turns to him abruptly:
        FRANZ: And how do you know they're innocent?
The farmer looks at Franz with round eyes. A long PAUSE
follows. Then the

        FARMER says (quietly): I don't know.

And after another PAUSE.

        FARMER: But I don't know the opposite either.
                                



30. MANOR. STAIRWELL. INT/NIGHT
The Baron stands at the bottom and shouts up at the
tutor who's standing on the stairs:
        BARON:...What do you mean "not there"?
        TUTOR   (sheepish):   He...  disappeared.    I`ve
        already looked everywhere. I can't find him.
        BARON: Nonsense. He can't have vanished     into
        thin air. When did you see him last?
        TUTOR (as above): Around 2 o'clock.
        BARON (his anger mounting): Around two? Do you
        know what time it is?!
        TUTOR (guiltily): I know, Sir.
Furious, the landowner turns away from the nincompoop,
pensive. Then he turns to the TUTOR again:
        BARON: What does my wife say, doesn't she have
        any clue?
        TUTOR: Madame sent me to you,     Baron. She is
        beside herself with fear.
        BARON (wryly): I can imagine.(looks up to the
        tutor): You're an idiot, Huber. Why do you think
        you're here? To take care of a single child! Is
        that such a hard task?
        TUTOR (softly): I'm awfully sorry, Baron.
        BARON: You're even too stupid for that.
The Baron turns away and heads for the door. Then he
turns around again and asks:


                                                            33

       BARON: Where did you see my son for the last
       time?
       TUTOR: Outside, in the courtyard. He said, he
       was going to play with the other children.
       BARON: Where?
       TUTOR: That he didn't say.
       BARON: And      my   wife   didn't   notice   anything
       either?
       TUTOR: After that business with the cabbage
       heads, Madame retired to her room. She was
       indisposed.
       BARON (sarcastically): Indisposed?!
       TUTOR: Yes. She had a terrible migraine attack.
        BARON (almost to himself): My God, this place is
        a zoo!
He turns away and goes out into the courtyard. The tutor
follow him with his eyes. He feels he's being badly
treated and hates the Baron for his insults. Finally he
goes back up the stairs.

                               



31. MANOR. EXT/NIGHT
BACK TO THE SCENE.
The torches of the feast have almost burned out. Here
and there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitate
the cleaning up.
Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vast
courtyard. Half way across he screams:
        BARON: Bräker!!
The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who are
putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the
barn. He walks toward the Baron.
        BARON. Have you seen my son?
       STEWARD (surprised): No.
       BARON (quietly): Could you please ask your boys.
       Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole
       bunch of kids.
       STEWARD:    Immediately.   (shouting    to   the
       farmhands): When you're finished with the
       cleaning up, wait for me. There's still a job to
       do. Get some fresh torches and lanterns!
       BARON: In the meantime I'll go round up the men.
                                                                34

The steward goes to his house, the Baron         to   the
outbuildings. There, he switches on the SIREN.

        NARRATOR: The steward's children said, they had
        seen Sigi only for a short time, that he had
        gone off with other kids, and that they didn't
        pay much attention to it...
                                


32. MONTAGE EXT/INT/NIGHT
IN THE COURTYARD.
Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches.
The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns
the areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out by
the narrator's voice.

        NARRATOR: ...The search began shortly after
        midnight. Before, the Baron had ridden to the
        Rectory. But there he found out nothing new from
        the children who had been specially woken up.


STABLE AND OUTBUILDINGS OF THE ESTATE.
VARIOUS LANDSCAPES: FOREST, FIELD, RIVER MEADOWS.
The search.
        The searchers, who were tired and some of whom
        were still drunk, were divided into two groups:
        one group started to search all the buildings on
        the estate, one by one, while the others combed
        the surrounding areas.
        It was around half past two, when some members
        of the search party had already preferred to lie
        down   somewhere   and   to   sleep  off   their
        drunkenness, that the siren suddenly sounded
        again, calling the men back to the courtyard...
IN THE COURTYARD.
The men come in with a stretcher.
        ...They had found Sigi. He had been tied up in
        the old sawmill, upside down. His trousers had
        been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding
        from cane strokes. He seemed to be in a state of
        shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought
        back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher,
        lying on his belly.
                                


33. CHURCH INT/DAY
The room is packed. The whole village is gathered.
                                                            35

        NARRATOR: The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end
        of the service, asked the pastor if he could say
        a few words:

        BARON: You all know now what was done to my son
        Siegmund. Policemen from the district town were
        here this week. They questioned many of you. But
        to no avail. First I thought that the people who
        tortured my child were the same people who cut
        off my family's "cabbage heads"...

Unrest in the attendance.


        ...because they wanted to "get even". Get even
        for what? Because their mother had died while
        she was working in the sawmill, and it was
        supposedly  my  fault,   which  is  an  absurd
        assertion.

The farmer, Leni and the other children are there, with
the exception of Franz.

The unrest grows.


        At least, that's what Franz Felder gave as the
        motive for his "mowing prowess", when the
        policemen arrested him. I have always supported
        the farmer Felder and his family, but one can't
        always expect people to be grateful. That's a
        matter of character.

The farmer wants to leave the church.

        BARON: Don't run away, Felder. It's your honor I
        want to salvage.
        It has turned out that the valiant Franz Felder
        has been boasting of his feat in front of his
        fiancée. Then the coward that he is, hid among
        his family, and so he didn't have time to
        torture my son. And there's one thing I know for
        sure: the senior Felder would rather bite off
        his tongue, than cover for his wayward son. May
        I remind you something what most of you have
        already forgotten. Almost two months ago, the
        doctor had a riding accident and he has still
        not returned from the hospital. This accident
        was caused by a wire that had been strung in his
        garden with the explicit intent of bringing him
        down. And in that case too, nobody knows
        anything, saw anything or heard anything.

                                                           36

Disconcerted MUTTER among the attendance.


        We all know that the people responsible for the
        terrible injuries suffered by my son, and those
        suffered by the doctor are sitting here among
        us, in this room. I won't tolerate that crimes
        of this nature go unpunished. I don't wish
        something similar to happen to any of your
        children. That's why I call upon you all to help
        me find the culprit or the culprits. Ask
        questions, keep your ears open, be watchful. If
        we fail to find out the truth, the peace within
        our community will be gone. Thank you, pastor.

The pastor says a few last words which we don't grasp,
that the narrator's voice drowns out. The people file
out of the church, quietly and slowly, but talking
worriedly to each other.

        NARRATOR: The landowner's speech frightened the
        people. Most knew about the incident at the
        Thanksgiving feast. But the majority didn't know
        exactly what had happened, and in the end they
        didn't care. The Baron was not really popular
        among the people, but he was respected as a
        powerful social figure, as well as the employer
        of nearly the whole village.
                                

34. IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH EXT/DAY
BACK TO THE SCENE.
The people are leaving the church, groups are forming.
As the farmer Felder and his children come out, they're
shunned.
Gauntlet down the village street. The CAMERA follows.
         NARRATOR: ...His threat about loosing the peace
         of the community couldn't mean anything good.
        At the same time the mysterious character of
        what were obviously criminal deeds fed the
        mistrust of the farmers, deeply rooted since
        time immemorial.
                            

35. SCHOOL. INT/NIGHT
The empty classroom. On the harmonium: a petroleum lamp.
The schoolteacher is PLAYING.
After a while, someone knocks at the door. The
schoolteacher stops.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised): Come in!
                                                           37

The door opens hesitantly. In the dark: Eva (hardly
recognizable because she's so far from the lamp).

        SCHOOLTEACHER (surprised and glad): Eva!
        EVA (hardly understandable): May I come in?
The Schoolteacher stands up, goes toward and, laughing
with surprise, says to her.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: What a question. Of course. Come
        in. What happened.


Eva enters the room and closes the door behind her.
She's carrying a suitcase. Shyly she looks around and
doesn't say a word.

        SCHOOLTEACHER:   Come   over   here.   It's   so   dark.
        Come on.

He moves toward the lamp and waits half-way because she
doesn't follow.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on?

        EVA: They fired me.

        SCHOOLTEACHER (startled): What do you mean?

She shrugs her shoulders.

        EVA: Nothing. They just threw me out (pause,
        then) The tutor has also been fired.


Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, she bursts into
floods of tears. At the same time she turns away from
the schoolteacher. He goes over to her, and stops in
front of her, but is too shy to touch her. Suddenly she
turns to him again and says, sobbing:

        I don't know where to go. I can't go back home
        in the middle of the night. I'm afraid to walk
        on the road all alone.

        SCHOOLTEACHER (calming her down): Don't worry.
        Try to calm down. There's nothing to worry
        about.


                                                                   38

        EVA (sobbing, childish): There is.


        SCHOOLTEACHER (with a calming smile): Come here
        and sit down. Please calm down and then tell me
        what happened. All right?

She's sits down on the school bench beside her. The
schoolteacher sits on his haunches in front of her:

        Well?!

It takes her time to calm down.

        What happened?


Slowly she manages to calm down, breathes deeply a few
times. The schoolteacher is visibly charmed by her
childish despair.

        EVA: The son of the Baron isn't at all well. His
        parents are angry and desperate. Now they say
        that it's the tutor's and my fault, because we
        didn't pay enough attention to him. But I'm only
        there for the twins.

She starts to sob again:

        I've always taken care of them very well. When
        you and I were dancing, the Baroness had given
        me permission. I haven't done anything wrong,
        really.


        SCHOOLTEACHER: I know, come on. Stop crying!

        EVA: Where shall I go now? We need the money I
        was earning here.

        SCHOOLTEACHER:   You'll  find   something  else.
        Besides, you know very well that the Baron is
        quick-tempered. With him, nothing is ever as bad
        as it seems.

        EVA (fiercely shaking her head):No, no, that's
        all over now, I know it. The Baroness doesn't
        want to see anyone. She wants to take the
        children with her to town or to her parent's
        estate ­ I don't know exactly.
                                                           39

        SCHOOLTEACHER: (after a pause): I'll try to talk
        to her. A while back, we played music together.
        (with a smile): Unfortunately, I wasn't very
        good. Now she's got the tutor, he plays better.
        As far as I know, he's been studying music in
        town.


        EVA (forgetting her grief a bit): He doesn't
        play that well.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's true.

        EVA (after a pause, serious again): Who could
        have done such things?

        SCHOOLTEACHER: What?

        EVA: To beat a child that way.


        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know.

Long PAUSE. Then she says softly:

        EVA: Can I stay here tonight?         Don't send me
        away, sir, please.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: How can you think something like
        that?

        EVA: I'll just wait for the daylight to come.
        Here in the classroom. Then I'll leave.


Suddenly she starts to cry again:

        They won't understand this,      at   home.   They'll
        think I did something wrong.

PAUSE. Then the

        SCHOOLTEACHER: Do you want me to come with you.

She stops crying and looks at him, surprised.

                                                                40

        EVA: What did you say?

        SCHOOLTEACHER    (cheerful):   Tomorrow,   after
        school? I can try to find us a carriage. I'll be
        back by evening.

        EVA: And why should you do that, Sir.


        SCHOOLTEACHER: Stop being so formal.


        EVA (after a break): Why should you do this?


PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher stands up and says:

        SCHOOLTEACHER: Come here, I'll play something
        for you. If you'd like that.

She thinks for a moment, then she nods eagerly. She
follows him, as he goes and settles in front of the
harmonium. She sits on a bench nearby. He starts to
PLAY.

                                      

36. FARM. PIGSTY. INT/EXT/DAY
The farmer and Paul are cleaning the pigsty which is not
very big. The pigs grunt excitedly because of the
disturbance.
Suddenly, Franz enters.
         FRANZ: Good morning, Father.
The farmer looks up, keeps on working as if nobody had
come in.
Paul greets Franz with a nod, remaining silent.
After a while, they've done their work. Ignoring Franz,
the farmer goes outside.
Franz, who has stepped aside to let his father by, says
to him as he goes out:
         FRANZ: I'm back again. They set me free.
At this, the farmer stops and turns around. He looks
Franz right into the eyes:
         FARMER: I can see that. So what?
Franz bows his head. Paul, who has followed his father,
out of the pigsty, glances surreptitiously at his
brother. The farmer goes over to the fountain and washes
himself. Franz follows him slowly and stops beside his
father, who keeps ignoring him. After a while

                                                           41

        FRANZ says (softly): Can't you forgive me,
        Father?
The farmer stops washing and turns to Franz:
        FARMER: What do you want me to forgive for? That
        the estate won't give me any work now? That Leni
        has been fired in disgrace? That your brothers
        and sisters soon won't have anything to eat. Is
        that what you mean? Or is it something else?


                            

37. COUNTRY ROAD AND DOCTOR'S PROPERTY EXT/DAY
The CAMERA follows the carriage in which are Eva and the
schoolteacher.
        NARRATOR: The next day, after school, I went to
        the estate to inquire about Sigi's health and to
        intercede for Eva's reinstatement. We were told
        the Baroness had left that morning with her
        children. Reluctantly, the steward lent me a
        carriage to take Eva home.
An open carriage with the Doctor inside comes from the
opposite direction. The passengers of the two carriages
greet each other. The CAMERA follows the Doctor and
looses Eva and the schoolteacher.
The doctor has one arm in a sling.
The Doctor's carriage ends up turning into his property.
The driver helps the doctor get out. Xenia comes running
out of the house and greets her father. The driver
unloads the luggage. The doctor and Xenia go into the
house.

       Just as we were leaving the village, we met the
       doctor.
       A few days after the Thanksgiving feast,
       Rudolph, his four year old son, had suddenly
       disappeared. Of course, everybody was terribly
       upset in view of all the previous occurrences.
       Finally, he was found walking down the road,
       scantily dressed for a trip, headed eagerly
       toward the town. When he was asked where he was
       going, he said he wanted to visit his father.
       Seems he fought tooth and nail against being
       taken home.
       Somebody must have told this to the Doctor.
       Since he was scheduled to be released from
       medical care anyway, he had prematurely put an
       end to his stay at the hospital.

                            


                                                           42

38. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE INT/DAY
BACK TO THE SCENE.
STAIRWELL.
        DOCTOR (calls several times): Rudi?
He throws an ironical inquiring look at Xenia. Xenia
shrugs her shoulders, clueless:

        XENIA: He was in the living room a short time
        ago.

Just as they're about to go to the living room, the
driver comes in with the luggage. The Doctor thanks him
and pays him. The driver leaves. Xenia has been waiting
in the doorway. Now they go together into the

LIVING ROOM
There's nobody. They go into the kitchen
KITCHEN. Nobody. The look under the kitchen table, in
the pantry. Nobody.

         DOCTOR: Rudi? Where are you?
Again the
STAIRWELL. The doctor doesn't know whether to be angry
or to laugh about the whole matter. He goes to his
wardrobe to take his off his jacket. Because of the
sling, Xenia has to help him. That's when she notices
the toilet. She tells her father with a smile. As Xenia
hangs up the doctor's jacket, he goes to the toilet door
and tries to open it. It's locked. The Doctor stops in
front of it.
         DOCTOR (quiet): Hello, Rudi. Don't you want to
         say hello to your father? No?
PAUSE:
         I heard you even wanted to visit me at the
         hospital. And now you lock yourself in?
PAUSE. The doctor looks shortly at Xenia who's carrying
the luggage upstairs. Then he keeps on talking to
Rudolph:
         All right. Then, I don't want to see you either.
         I'm going away now. You can stay in the toilet,
         if you want.
He goes down the few steps to the entrance, waits a
moment and then leaves the house.


                                



39. PROPERTY THE DOCTOR'S EXT/DAY
BACK TO THE scene.
                                                            43

The doctor steps out of the door, and wanders through
the garden. He goes over to the trees, where the wire
had been strung. He examines the traces of the wire on
the bark. He lights a cigar, then looks out at the mowed
fields.
After a while Xenia comes over to him. He glances at
her, then again at the fields. Both remain silent. After
a while
        XENIA   says:  Everything  is   ready  in   your
        practice.   Mrs.   Wagner  prepared   everything
        yesterday.

PAUSE then

        DOCTOR: Why do you tell me that?

Xenia looks at him, surprised, shrugs her shoulders.
        XENIA: I don't know. I just thought you might
        want to know.
PAUSE.
        DOCTOR: Has she taken good care of you?
        XENIA: Yes.
PAUSE. The doctor turns to Xenia:
        DOCTOR: How old are you now?
        XENIA: Fourteen.
The doctor looks at her, laughs silently and shakes his
head. Again he looks out on the fields. After a while he
says:
        DOCTOR: It's amazing how much you look like your
        mother.
Xenia remains silent. Suddenly she whispers:

        XENIA: Dad.

The doctor turns to her. She nods toward the house. The
doctor follows her look. Indeed Rudolph, who from here
looks even smaller than he really is, has stepped
gingerly out of the door. Unsure and undecided, torn
between defiance and longing, he's kept one hand on the
door handle that he can barely reach.


                            

40. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/NIGHT
The pastor cleans the cage of the small bird behind the
desk and feeds the animal. As he does it, he talks to

                                                           44

Martin, who, the white ribbon still tied around his
upper arm, stands in front of the desk.
        PASTOR: Your mother and I are deeply worried
        about you. Think about it. Are you sleeping
        badly? Are you overtired?
       MARTIN   (as   if   he   didn't   understand   the
       question): No.
       PASTOR: Do you have problems in school that I
       don't know?
        MARTIN (as above): No, Father.
The pastor turns shortly around to his son, looks at
him, then turns again to the bird.

       PASTOR: You probably don't understand why we
       worry. It comes from a sad experience I want to
       tell you briefly about:
       As you know, I'm also acting as pastor for the
       communities of Birkenbrunn and Hebern. In the
       latter place, some years ago, a mother came to
       see me. She had noticed that her son, who was
       about the same age as you, and had the same
       symptoms that you've been showing for some time.
       Although until then the boy had been healthy and
       active,   suddenly   he  showed   a   noticeable
       weariness, he had dark rings under the eyes,
       seemed depressed and joyless. The boy had also
       changed emotionally: before he had been funny,
       frank, almost naughty, but now he became
       withdrawn. He tried not to look his parents in
       the eye, and was caught telling small and even
       big lies.

The pastor has finished the cleaning and feeding, and
now sits down behind his desk, Martin opposite him:
        That lasted approximately half a year. Then
        everything went very fast: he lost his appetite,
        couldn't sleep any more, his whole face took on
        the brownish color of the rings under his eyes,
        his hands began to shake, his memory stated to
        fail him, he was covered with numerous small
        pustules, first on his face, then on his whole
        body and finally he died. The body, which I
        blessed, looked like the body of an old man.
The pastor watches Martin:
        PASTOR: Do you understand now why I'm worried?
Martin reacts with a timid nod of his head.
        PASTOR: So, according to you: what caused these
        changes that led to the miserable end of this
        boy?
       MARTIN (hardly able to speak): I don't know.
                                                            45

        PASTOR: I think you know well.
Martin doesn't know what to say, he looks down. The
pastor watches him for a long moment, then he gets up,
walks around the desk and sits down on its edge, in
front of the boy, so that their heads are facing each
other.

        Won't you tell me? No?
        Then I'll tell you what the cause was: The boy
        had learned from someone, who had harmed the
        finest nerves of his body, in the area where
        God's will has erected sacred barriers. The boy
        imitated this action. He couldn't stop doing it,
        so that at the end he destroyed all the nerves
        in his body, and so much that he died of it.

Martin seems very affected. He has bowed his head,
swallows several times, and hardly dares to breath.
        Look at me, Martin.
Martin looks up fearfully, then immediately looks away
again.
        I just want to help you. I love you with all my
        heart. Look at me.
Martin looks his father in the eyes.
        Be sincere, Martin. Why did you blush and become
        so nervous when I told you the story of the poor
        boy.
        MARTIN: Blushed? I don't know... I felt sorry
        for him.
        PASTOR: Is that all?
        No, Martin, there has to be another reason. It's
        written on your face.
        Be sincere, Martin. Sincerity brings you closer
        to God, our beloved Father, and to all human
        beings.
        MARTIN (starts to cry): Oh, my God!
He cries in a such pitiful way that even the pastor has
tears in his eyes. He embraces the boy. The latter
seizes the hand of his father and kisses it intensely.
        PASTOR: Well, Martin, why are you crying? Shall
        I spare you that confession? You too have done
        what that wretched boy did, haven't you?
        MARTIN (crying): Oh my God! Yes.
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                            




                                                           46

41. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT/NIGHT
Intercourse between the midwife and the doctor. She
holds on to the sideboard, as he penetrates her from
behind. Both are fully dressed, she has just lifted her
skirt.
When he is ready, she turns around and puts her arms
around him. He lets her do it, with a patronizing smile
and pulls gently away from her.
        DOCTOR: Careful, my arm.
She tries to hide her frustration, sits down again with
him at the table, on which are the leftovers of their
meal. With a little ironic smile, the doctor raises his
glass to her. She takes her glass and clinks it with
his. She drinks. An embarrassed silence follows.
Finally, she says
        MIDWIFE: It's great that you're back. It was
        about time.
         DOCTOR: You can say that. Yes.
PAUSE.
         MIDWIFE: It was   difficult    with    the    children,
         without you.
         DOCTOR: I know.
         MIDWIFE: He doesn't like me.
         DOCTOR: Who?
         MIDWIFE: Rudi.
         DOCTOR (after a pause): He's at a difficult age.
        MIDWIFE: Actually not.
PAUSE. Then:
        They're always at a difficult age.
        DOCTOR (more to himself, with a faint smile):
        Yes.
LONG PAUSE.
        MIDWIFE: You didn't miss me.
         DOCTOR: Come on. What are you saying?!
         MIDWIFE: Nothing. I said it because it's the
         truth.
PAUSE.
         DOCTOR: There's   nothing   like   a   nice    dose   of
         self-hate.
         MIDWIFE: What?
         DOCTOR: Nothing. Forget it.

                                                                    47

After a pause, she reaches over the table, takes his
hand, puts her cheek against it. He lets her do it, then
takes his hand from under her head and strokes her hair.

                            



42. CHURCH EXT/DAY
It's snowing. From the inside of the church, we hear the
children's choir:
CHILDREN (singing in harmony):

        ...us free from all misery,
        That has hit us now.
        That old evil enemy,
        Is serious about it,
        Great power and much deceit
        Are his cruel armor,
        No one on earth resembles him...*

Over this:

        NARRATOR: Winter came early that year. At the
        Reformation feast on the first Sunday of
        November, a deep blanket of snow covered the
        village.
        The Baron, who had come back without his family,
        didn't attend, which was very unusual for him...

                            



43. CHURCH INT/DAY
IMMEDIATE BACK TO THE scene.
The community celebrates the Reformation Feast.
The schoolteacher conducts the children's choir. The
children sing enthusiastically. Marie and Martin wear
the white ribbon on their arm.

        NARRATOR: ...The villagers took that as a sign
        of his anger. Indeed, no evidence had been found
        as to the possible author of the crime, although
        the Baron's appeal had led to a flood of mutual
        suspicions,   even    to   some    attempts   of
        denunciation that had all turned out to be
        untenable.


                                




                                                           48

44. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHT
The doctor examines the steward's baby that is crying.
Finally, he turns to the parents.
        DOCTOR: Well, it's not pneumonia. But you must
        be careful. If his temperature rises, call me
        again. For the time being you must give these
        drops every two hours. And hang some wet sheets
        over the oven. That facilitates breathing.
While the mother puts the child back in the cradle, the
doctor and the father go down the STAIRWAY to the LIVING
ROOM.
        How long has the window been open?
       STEWARD: Difficult to say. My wife nursed him at
       about one o'clock. When she came back, it was
       around half past two. At that time it was icy
       cold in this room.
       DOCTOR: And the baby didn't cry?
        STEWARD: No. The children were upstairs and
        didn't hear anything either.
They have reached the living room where Liesl, Georg and
Ferdinand get up as he comes in.
        DOCTOR (to the children): He's doing all right,
        considering the circumstances. We have to wait.
The children seem worried. To calm them the doctor adds:
        For now we'll have to wait.
The steward has gone to the sideboard.
        STEWARD: Can I offer you something to warm you
        up?
       DOCTOR: No, thanks. I'm overloaded with work.
       When one has been away for so long...
        STEWARD: Georg!
At a sign of the father, Georg jumps up and gets the
doctor's coat and hat from outside. In the meantime, the
father keeps on chatting with the doctor:
        And how is your arm doing?
       DOCTOR: It's all right. Everything will be fine
       in two or three weeks.
        STEWARD: That must be terrible, I imagine. You
        probably feel like half a man when you can't use
        your arm properly.
Georg has come back with the hat and the coat, and hands
them to the doctor,
        DOCTOR: Thank you.
The steward helps him with his coat because of his bad
arm.
                                                           49

         DOCTOR (laughs): Quod erat demonstrandum. Thank
         you. Well, good night, children.
         CHILDREN: Good night, Doctor.
        DOCTOR (to the steward who holds the door open):
        Thank you. If your wife thinks that the baby...
The steward closes the door to the stairwell, so that we
can't grasp the rest of their conversation.
The children are alone. They remain silent. Then
        FERDINAND: Well...
         GEORG: What do you mean "well"?
         FERDINAND ("dumb question,      it's   obvious"):   I
         mean! That's fine.
PAUSE.
         LIESL (to Ferdinand): When did you go down to
         see Father? Down in his office.
         FERDINAND: Why?
         LIESL: Just asking.


                              



45. SNOW-COVERED COUNTRY ROAD EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher, a rucksack on his back, walks through
the snow which is only furrowed by some carriage tracks.

         NARRATOR: In mid-December, I finally got a
         letter from Eva. Her father had found her a new
         job in the district capital, which she would
         start at the beginning of the New Year.
         Since that night, where she had come looking for
         shelter in the school and we had tried to tell
         each other the story of our short lives until
         the wee hours of the morning, I could no longer
         banish from my thoughts her pale face, her shy
         but frank personality and her shining hair red.
         The school holidays lasted until the morning
         after New Year's Day, but already the second day
         after Christmas ­ the weather was cold but sunny
         ­ I went on my way to Obersdorf in order to
         visit Eva and her parents.


                              


                                                                 50

46. THE HORSE-TRADER'S LIVING-ROOM INT/DAY
A lower middle-class room.
The schoolteacher sits in front of Eva and her siblings,
6 children between 14 and 6, mostly red-haired like Eva.
Embarrassed silence. The younger children whisper and
giggle. The conversation is slow. After a long pause
        EVA says: And Sigi?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. The Baroness isn't
        back yet.
        EVA: And the Baron?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): We hardly see him. He
        talks to nobody. I don't know. Some say they've
        gone to the south. To Italy.
        EVA: To Italy? Really.
PAUSE.   The   children    giggle,   amused   over    the
embarrassment of the two people.
The schoolteacher and Eva look at each other, but Eva
soon averts her eyes.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: They now want to tear down the
        sawmill for good. That's what the steward says.
        Because it isn't worthwhile to...
At that moment the door opens and Eva's parents come in.
Obviously, the mother went to fetch the father. She is
plump, in her late forties and only wears a woolen shawl
over her shoulders. The father wears a hat and overcoat.
He's a sturdy man in his early fifties, of peasant
stock. He probably came straight from a tavern, and
appears to be slightly drunk. The schoolteacher, Eva and
the children stand up. The schoolteacher bows deeply:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good morning.
        FATHER: Good morning, young man.
They shake hands.
        FATHER: Please be seated. We're not very formal
        here.
With a short movement of his hand the father invites him
to sit down.
        FATHER (to the children): Scram!
The children, rather sheepish since the arrival of their
father, leave the room. The father unbuttons his over
coat, throws the hat on the sofa and sits down. The
mother has removed her shawl and asks the schoolteacher:
        MOTHER: Would you like something to drink?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: No, thank you. Very kind.
        MOTHER: Really?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Really. Thank you very much.
                                                            51

The father sits      down beside Eva and looks at the
schoolteacher. Eva    appears to be awkward, and stares at
the table in front   of her.
        FATHER: So   you're a schoolteacher.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes.
        FATHER: Can you afford to have a wife?
Short embarrassed PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: My father works as a tailor in
        Grundbach. I have an apprentice's diploma. So I
        earn quite a bit on the side
         FATHER: You should have taken over your father's
         business, that would have been smarter.
PAUSE.
         Well. And why are you so focused on that girl?
         She's almost still a child. You could almost be
         her father.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): I'm thirty-one.
         FATHER (grinning): Well, you can still handle
         what matters.
        MOTHER (embarrassed): Father!
Eva and the schoolteacher don't know where to look.
        FATHER: Let's be serious: do you know whether
        she's willing to get married. She's still a
        child. She hasn't seen anything of the world.
        To Eva: Say something. Do you want him?
Eva wishes the earth would engulf her.
        FATHER: Come on. Don't make such a fuss. He
        walked all the way over through the fresh snow.
         MOTHER: Why don't you leave her alone.         Of
         course, she wants him. Can't you feel that?!
        FATHER: How can I? If she keeps her mouth shut!
Eva jumps up and runs out, so as not to burst into tears
out of shame.
The mother follows her, shaking her head disapprovingly
at the father. The schoolteacher stands up, as Eva ran
out. He'd rather follow her, but has to remain polite
toward the father. The father says calmly:

         FATHER: Just sit down. That's how women are. A
         bit hysterical, the whole lot of them. Listen.
         I'm not a big talker. On one hand, it suits me
         for the girl to leave the house. We have a lot
         of mouths to feed, as you can see.


                                                             52

         On the other hand, it's all moving a bit too
         fast for me. I don't know you. It's not that I
         don't like you, but I need to get some
         information about you first. Besides, the town
         hairdresser has agreed to take her on as an
         apprentice.
         That way she'll get to meet people and she can
         make up he mind whether she really wants this or
         not. And if in a year's time she has stuck to
         this idea, we can l talk about it again. And you
         can make up your mind too, all right?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I actually thought I...
         FATHER (interrupts him): I know, I know. But
         it's either that or nothing. You get it?
         SCHOOLTEACHER (after a short pause) steps back:
         If you insist...
        FATHER: Yes, I do.
He holds out his hand to the schoolteacher, who accepts
it after a brief hesitation.
        FATHER: That's it. I'm pleased. Well, business
        is waiting. Even on holidays. I'll send the girl
        back in so that you can say good-bye. A year
        goes by fast. The world won't collapse. And
        during your holidays you can come and visit her.
        Good-bye.
He leaves the room. The schoolteacher is thrown off
balance by all this. He stands up and takes a few steps.
He sits down again and thinks.
Finally, the door opens and Eva enters. She doesn't
really know what to do. Neither does the schoolteacher.
As she comes in he stands up again. Finally Eva goes
over to the table and sits down. The schoolteacher also
sits down. They exchange a short glance and an equally
brief smile.
PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER says: Did your father tell...?
         EVA: Yes.
PAUSE.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Is that all right with you?
PAUSE.
         EVA: Is that all right with you, sir?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiles): Don't be so formal with
        me.
Eva looks up. Their eyes meet. Then she takes his hand
in her hand. They remain seated without saying a word.

                             
                                                            53

47. RECTORY. THE BOYS' BEDROOM. INT/NIGHT
It is dark. Martin, Anton and Florian, whom we don't
recognize at first glance, are lying in their beds.
Through the window, a red glow, slowly getting stronger.
Suddenly
         MARTIN'S VOICE: Toni! Are you awake?
       Toni!!
       ANTON'S VOICE (half asleep): What is it?
       MARTIN VOICE: Look.
       ANTON'S VOICE: What's happening?
        MARTIN VOICE: Look! Look what's happening out
        there!!
Now, Anton sits up slowly, rubs his eyes.
        ANTON'S VOICE: My God, what do you want?
        MARTIN VOICE: Over there!! Have a look out of
        the window!!
Anton turns to the window and looks at the red glow.
Then he slips out of the bed and goes to the window.
Suddenly, he is wide-awake:
        ANTON: Something is burning! Over there at the
        estate!
         MARTIN: Untie me!
Anton turns around to Martin, hesitates.
         MARTIN: Come on, untie me!
Anton doesn't really know what to do. He turns to the
window again, then again to Martin. The latter screams
angrily:
         I told you to untie me!!
       ANTON: I don't know...
        MARTIN: I'll beat you black and blue, if you
        don't untie me!
The loud dispute has now also awakened Florian, who says
in a drowsy voice:
        FLORIAN: What's happening? Why can't you be
        quiet.
       MARTIN: Flori, come over and untie me!
       FLORIAN: What's going on?
       MARTIN (yells): Untie me, dammit!! You idiots!
       It's burning!!
                                                           54

        FLORIAN: It's burning?
Florian gets up himself and patters to the window. He
looks out and then says, amazed and enthusiastic:
        It's burning!
        MARTIN (imitates him angrily): OK, it's burning!
        Now untie me, godammit!
Florian looks at Anton with questioning eyes and then
says to Martin:
        FLORIAN: But Father hasn't allowed it...
Reverse angle POV of the two boys at the window toward
Martin, who we see for the first from the front. His
wrists are tied to the left and the right side of the
bed. Trying sit up, he pulls furiously at his ties.
        MARTIN (furious): But if there's an emergency,
        you idiot. Somebody must warn them! (he yells
        loudly: Faaaather!! Mooooother!! Father!
Frightened by his screams, Anton now goes over to him
and undoes his ties.
        ANTON: Stop shouting. I'll untie you.
        FLORIAN: Shall I call Mother?
We already hear hurried STEPS in the corridor. The door
opens and the mother enters, dressed in a nightgown.
        MOTHER: What's going on here?
Martin has just been untied.
        MARTIN: It's burning!
        MOTHER: I know. Your father has already gone.
In the door, the girls appear after their mother. They
have left their room attracted by the noise. The mother
turns to them:
        MOTHER: What are you doing here? (to everyone):
        You all go to bed now. It's nothing. There's a
        fire on the estate. You don't need to be afraid.
        Go to bed and sleep. Come on, Marie, take your
        sisters with you and go to your room. Otherwise
        you'll catch a cold.
The girls disappear again. The mother turns to Martin:
        Why did you make so much noise? You woke us all
        up!
Martin doesn't know what to answer. Then he says
apologetically:
        MARTIN: I thought it was dangerous.
       ANTON (apologizing): I had to untie his hands.
       MOTHER (calming them down): Now, everything's
       all right again. Tomorrow, Father will tell you
       what happened with the fire. All right? Now you
                                                           55

        all got back to bed. I'll wait till you're back
        in bed. It's freezing cold outside.
The three boys go back to bed. But first Anton ties up
Martin's hands again. He pulls a blanket over his
brother. Then they all disappear under their blankets.

       MOTHER: Good night then. Sleep well.
        MARTIN, ANTON, FLORIAN: Good night, Mom!
The mother closes the door. Coming from outside, we can
see the glow of the fire.

                              

48. ESTATE EXT/NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT.
A big barn is blazing   fiercely. SOUNDS of the FIRE.
Against it we see,       as silhouettes, the Baron, the
steward and his wife,   the pastor, and all those, who are
vainly trying to save   thing.

                              


49. THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/NIGHT
In the children's bedroom, lit by the reflection from
the nearby flames: Liesl, Georg and Ferdinand. They
stand at the window and stare into the flames.


                              

50. FARM BUILDINGS /EXT/DAY
Paul discovers his dead father in the pigsty. The farmer
has hung himself up from a hook in the wall. The
knocked-over stool still lies beneath his dangling feet.
Paul runs from the stable out to the
courtyard. He stops.
Then he tiptoes toward the stable door. As he touches
the stable door, he lacks the strength to go inside
again. Slowly he heads for the living room. The
children, who are gathered, pay no attention to him.
Leni, who's cooking, has looked up from her work
briefly. Paul sits down on the bench against the wall.
It is quite dark in there.

                              


51. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. OFFICE. INT/DAY
The doctor sits at his desk, the midwife sits on the
visitor's chair opposite him. She tries to masturbate
him.

                                                             56

This time, too, both are fully dressed. Over his
clothes, the doctor wears an unbuttoned white coat.
He watches the woman for a while in her activity, then
he says coldly:
        DOCTOR: Wouldn't it be better if you stopped
        doing that?
It's like a slap in the face. She looks dumbfounded.

       DOCTOR: Why all the effort? Don't look at me so
       dumbfounded.
       It's not that you lack talent... It's just that
       I can't do it with you any more, that's all.
       To tell you the truth: you disgust me.

He gets up and buttons up his pants. She feels as if the
world had collapsed around her.
        Please finish your work now? I don't want to
        spend all night here.
The midwife remains seated, her head bowed, as if struck
by a lightning
        MIDWIFE (quietly): What did I do to you?
        DOCTOR (irritated): My God, you haven't done
        anything at all. You're ugly, you're messy,
        you're flabby and you have bad breath. Isn't
        that enough?
PAUSE. He points at the examination couch on the other
side of the small room, saying casually:
        The upholstery has to be sterilized with boiling
        water
She remains immobile, and shoots a quick mechanical
glance at the examination couch. He looks at her.
        Stop sitting there as if you were carrying all
        the world's woes on your shoulders. The world
        won't collapse down. Not on you, or on me.
       (explains):I just want it to stop, that's all.
       I've been trying, but it's just disgusting. I
       try to think of another woman when I'm making
       love to you, a woman who smells good, who's
       young one, one who's less flabby than you, but
       my imagination can't handle it. In the end, it's
       you again and then I just feel like throwing up
       and am embarrassed at myself. So what's the
       point?!
       MIDWIFE: Are you through?
        DOCTOR:(contemptuously)): Yes, I have been for
        ages.
He turns away. The midwife hardly moves. She's still
sitting on the visitor's chair. It takes her a lot of

                                                           57

strength not to faint ­ at the same time she speaks out
calmly.

         MIDWIFE: You must be very unhappy to be so mean.
         DOCTOR: Oh God! Please, not that routine!
         MIDWIFE: I know that I'm not much to look at. My
         bad breath comes from my stomach, you know that
         very well. But it didn't bother you in the past
         when we got together. I already had my ulcer
         when your wife was still alive.
         DOCTOR: Please spare me these sordid details.
         But let me reassure you: it has always disgusted
         me. I accepted it, because I wanted to ease my
         pain after Erika's death and I didn't care with
         whom. I could have screwed a cow. Whores are
         unfortunately too far from here and regrettably
         once every two months isn't enough for me, even
         though I'm getting older. So skip your damn
         martyrdom routine and get out.


PAUSE.
         MIDWIFE (keeps on speaking softly): Why did this
         only occur to you now?
         DOCTOR: According to you: when should it have
         occurred to me?
         At the hospital, I had forgotten how tiresome
         you were. One grows sentimental when one's in
         pain.
PAUSE.
         DOCTOR (tired): Get out. Why don't you get out.
         Don't you have any pride?
         MIDWIFE (equally tired): There's no room for any
         with you.
         DOCTOR: That's true.
         MIDWIFE: Aren't    you   afraid   that   I   might   do
         something silly?
         DOCTOR (laughs with disdain): Go ahead. At least
         that would surprise me. But be careful: it might
         be painful.
         MIDWIFE: I know. I'm ridiculous. You wouldn't
         care anyway.
        DOCTOR: Well...
She looks at him.



                                                                   58

        MIDWIFE: Why do you despise me? For helping to
        raise the boy? For watching you fingering your
        little daughter and not saying a word?

The doctor goes over and slaps her. Tears start to run
down her face, but after a short pause she keeps on
speaking, "unmoved":

        For helping you to deceive yourself? For
        listening to you claim how unique your love for
        Erika was, though the whole village knew, how
        badly you treated her?
        For loving you, although I know you can't stand
        being loved?

The doctor snorts with disdain.

        DOCTOR: That's it. Now leave me alone. I've got
        work to do.

She gets up and makes room for him. He sits down at the
desk and "works". She looks down at him:

        MIDWIFE: You can't afford to get rid of me. Who
        would do the dirty work for you, who would help
        you with the children, and here in you practice?
        You're not speaking seriously. You just want to
        see how far you can go, don't you: will she
        still put up with it or can I drag her even
        lower through the mud?

PAUSE. The doctor "works", as if he hadn't heard. She
keeps watching him for a while, and then says softly:
        I'm tired too. I've got two retarded children:
        Hans and you. You're the one that gives me most
        trouble.
He looks up at her. After a pause, he says:
        DOCTOR: My God, why don't you just die?!


                                




52. FARM. EXT/DAY
Rays of cold winter sun.
The men carry the coffin out of the house. Some people
are already waiting outside. All wear mourning clothes.
The coffin is shouldered, the funeral procession forms,
with the pallbearers and in the lead. The others who had
gathered in the house follow. Paul comes out with Sepp,
whom he tries to calm. Finally Leni comes out and, in
                                                           59

words that we can't hear, asks the old midwife to look
after the farm for a short while. She gathers her
sisters and with them gets in the funeral procession
right behind the coffin.
The procession starts to move off. As it comes around
the corner of the farm to go down the path leading to
the village, Franz comes toward them. Muttering is heard
from the villagers. They don't know how to react. The
procession slows down. Franz comes over. For a while he
stands in front of the coffin, head bowed. Then he joins
his brothers and sisters. He and Leni exchange a glance,
then he takes his place beside her. After he has
motioned to the coffin bearers, the procession starts to
move off again slowly, despite of the continued
muttering. Paul, who is still carrying Sepp, looks
expectantly toward his older brother who squeezes his
hand. Paul smiles shyly. Then Franz takes over little
Sepp, in the most natural way. For a long moment it
almost looks as if, despite of all the gloom, these
people weren't desperate.
                             



53. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAY
Various long shots of the snow-covered landscape.

        NARRATOR: The year was coming to an end with
        fine weather. The sun made the snowy landscape
        sparkle so brightly that it hurt the eyes.
        None of us suspected that it would be the last
        time a year moved on to the next in an era of
        peace, and that that same year a radical change
        would take place of which no one had the
        faintest inkling...
                                


54. RECTORY. LIVING ROOM. INT/DAY
The decorated Christmas tree. Outside bright sunlight.
The pastor is taking the white ribbon off Marie's head
and Martin's arm. The rest of the family witnesses this
almost solemn act.
        NARRATOR: ...Despite of the strange events, that
        had unsettled the village, we thought of
        ourselves as united in the belief that the life
        in our community was God's will and worth
        living.
        PASTOR: ... I take of this ribbon from you, in
        the belief that from now on you'll no longer
        need it.
        You, Marie, will be accepted this year as a full
        member of the church community. You will receive
                                                           60

        Christ's body as bread and as wine. May the time
        of preparation for the confirmation feast be one
        of happiness and enrichment.
        And you, Martin: from now on you shall not only
        be free of that ribbon, but also from those
        nightly ties that were intended to save you from
        yielding to the temptations of your young body.
        For in a house full of festive expectation, you
        too, on your own, shall make your contribution
        to mental and physical purity.
        I trust in you, my beloved children, and wish
        you a profitable and happy new year.
He strokes the children's heads. They kiss his hand. The
mother embraces them heartily.

                            

55. ESTATE EXT/DAY
Springtime.
The Baroness, Sigi and a new, a forty-ish nanny with the
twins are get out of a carriage in front of the manor.

        NARRATOR: Shortly after Easter, in the last week
        of April, the Baroness came back with the
        children. She was accompanied by a new nurse.
        Thus my secret hope that Eva would be able to
        come back here, had definitely been dashed.
        The nurse was a chubby, middle-aged Italian who
        came, as everybody soon learned, from the town
        on the Mediterranean coast where the Baroness
        had spent the winter.

A maid hurries out of the house with reinforcements, the
Baroness is being welcomed respectfully and the luggage
is being unloaded. The nurse gives instructions in
Italian, which leads to some confusion. Then the nanny
talks to Sigi who translates to the servants, laughing.
Besides, the boy looks transformed: instead of his
former pale skin color, his face now has a nice tan, his
fair hair has been further bleached by the sun, he has
grown taller and looks altogether stronger and happier.
The Baroness too seems more relaxed and restored.
She and Sigi are about to go straight into the house
when we hear, coming from the other side of the
courtyard
        FERDINAND'S VOICE: Sigi!
Sigi turns around. Ferdinand has seen him from the
window and called. Sigi waves back:
        SIGI: Hi, Ferdinand!
        FERDINAND: Wait! I'm coming down!
Sigi wants to run over to the steward's house.

                                                           61

       BARONESS:   Stay   here,   Sigi,   you   can   see   him
       later.
       NURSE (in Italian): Let him go, Signora! He's so
       happy to be home again.
        BARONESS (muses, then smiles): All right, you
        can go. But don't stay too long.
Sigi hurries off. The Baroness and the nurse look at
each other in agreement. The Baroness smiles faintly.
Then they go through the door into the house.
For a moment we only see the open door with the dark
stairwell behind it.
Then we hear the STEPS of the Baron, first on the gravel
in the yard. Then Baron comes into frame, and goes
through the door into the house. He vanishes into the
darkness of the stairwell. From there we hear his voice:
        BARON (calling): Beatrix? Beatrix, where are
        you?
The nurse comes out after a while again
        NURSE (calls in Italian): Sigi. Don't you want
        to come say hello to your father?
But Sigi is talking intensely to Ferdinand on the other
side of the courtyard and doesn't answer.


                             



56. SCHOOL. INT/DAY
CLASSROOMS.
The children are going wild. Brawling, sponge and chalk
are flying through the air. Some are packing up their
belongings, preparing to leave the classroom. In short,
the way children behave once the lesson is over.
Marie stands at the classroom door. She watches her
classmates. The she looks through the door into the
CORRIDOR.
It's empty. She comes back to the CLASSROOM, but stays
at the door so that she can still keep an eye on the
corridor. Apparently, she has been posted there as a
lookout to warn against the possible arrival of a
teacher.
The shouting, laughter and brawling goes on. Suddenly,
Marie sees the schoolteacher in the CORRIDOR
with her father. The two are having an animated
conversation. Marie bursts into the CLASSROOM and closes
the door to muffle the noise, then she shouts to her
classmates:
         MARIE: Watch out, he's coming!
But with all the shouting and laughter, her voice isn't
heard by all of the pupils. The noise dies down, some of
them stop misbehaving. Somebody picks up the sponge, and
                                                                  62

the blackboard is quickly cleaned up of the traces of
the fight. But a small group who had started to chase
each other around, doesn't hear and keeps at it. Marie
shouts to them again, this time louder:
        Be quiet! For God's sake! Be quiet!!
But as the wild chase goes on and some over-exited
children even make fun of her, and she yells at the top
of her voice:
        QUIET!!!!
At that moment, the door opens and the pastor comes in
with the schoolteacher.
Almost instantly, the room becomes QUIET. Without saying
a word, the pastor goes over to Marie, grabs her by the
ear and drags her through the whole classroom to the
stove, where he makes her stand, face to the wall. The
pupils remain silent, embarrassed.
While the pastor goes back to the black board, putting
his briefcase on the desk without saying a word, the
schoolteacher, who feels slightly responsible for the
lack of discipline of his classroom, says:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What's going on here? Why are you
        still here? You know that there's a confirmation
        class now! Get out!
The children disappear quickly. To the first child who
tries to sneak out the schoolteacher says:
        How about saying good-bye?
Immediately all the CHILDREN rushing out say:
         Good-bye, Sir! Good-bye, Pastor!
Finally, all the children have left the classroom,
except eight candidates for confirmation, among them
Paul, Xenia and Marie with her face still turned to the
wall.
The schoolteacher turns to the pastor:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm sorry, Pastor. It won't
        happen again.
The pastor answers with a reserved nod. In an icy
silence, he has waited for the all the younger pupils to
leave. As the schoolteacher notices that there will be
no further reaction from the pastor, he bows slightly to
him and says:
        Good-bye, Pastor.
        PASTOR: Good-bye.
The schoolteacher leaves the room. The pastor turns to
the candidates for confirmation:
        Let us pray.
They say the LORD'S PRAYER together. Then the pastor
says:
        Sit down.

                                                           63

The students sit down. Marie keeps standing facing the
wall. The pastor stops too. After a while he begins to
talk.
        This is a very sad day for me.
        In a few weeks, we all want to celebrate the
        confirmation feast together.
        For many months I have tried to bring God's word
        closer to you, and to make responsible human
        beings out of you in His spirit.
        And what do I face today? A horde of yelling
        monkeys,   without  any   discipline   or   human
        dignity, as childish as the seven-year olds,
        with whom you're sharing this classroom.
        But what makes me even sadder is the fact that
        my own daughter is playing the leading role in
        this pitiful display.
        Last year I bound a white ribbon in her hair.
        Well, you all know that white is the color of
        innocence. The ribbon was meant to help Marie to
        avoid sin, selfishness, envy, indecency, lies
        and sloth.
        Well, at the start of the year, I was naive
        enough to believe, that now, in the year of her
        confirmation, she'd become mature enough, and
        that she wouldn't need that ribbon any more
        I believed that she felt responsible, being the
        daughter of the spiritual leader of a Christian
        communi...

Marie, who all this time has been waiting beside the
stove, faints and collapses to the floor.


                            


57. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE. INT/NIGHT
STAIRWELL.
The only light comes in from the living room. Rudolph
comes down the stairs, wearing a nightshirt.
        RUDOLPH (softly): Xeni?
He goes into the LIVING ROOM.
It's empty.
        RUDOLPH (as above, anxiously): Xeni? Where are
        you?
He goes into the KITCHEN.
It's also empty. Rudolph is desperate. He starts to cry.
Finally, he goes back to the STAIRWELL and goes up the
stairs to his room.
On the stairway, he notices light coming from under the
door of the practice. He goes back down the stairs down
again and opens the door of the PRACTICE.
In the bright light, sitting in front of each other, are
the doctor and Xenia. The doctor has his back to
Rudolph, so that we see Xenia's face first. She sits on
                                                            64

the visitor's chair. He has placed his chair in front of
hers, and his legs are closed around her legs. She's
crying.
The situation is ambiguous, we don't know what has
happened.
The noise at the door startles Xenia, she looks at
Rudolph:
         XENIA (startled, her face tearstained): Rudi?!
The doctor spins around, and looks stunned to his young
son. Both look as if they have been caught red-handed.
         XENIA: What are you doing here? Why aren't you
         in bed?
Rudolph doesn't really know, what to think of all this,
but   being    the  good   child   he   is,  he   answers
automatically:
         RUDOLPH: I can't get to sleep.
        XENIA: That's why you're wandering around like a
        ghost in the middle of the night?
        RUDOLPH: I woke up and you weren't there.
Short PAUSE. Xenia wipes the tears from her face.
        XENIA (trying to smile): Dad has pierced      my
        earlobes.
        RUDOLPH: Does it hurt?
        XENIA: Yes, a bit.
        RUDOLPH: That's why you're crying?
        XENIA (tries to smile): I'm not crying any more.
        DOCTOR (trying to joke): Beauty has to suffer.
        That's what they say. At least for girls...
He gets up and goes, still seen from behind, to a
closet, and puts something into it that we can't
recognize. He's straightens his clothes. Then he goes
over to Rudolph:
        DOCTOR: Now go to bed again. You too, Xeni.
        XENIA: Yes.
As Rudolph hesitates and looks at her dubiously, she
explains, almost eagerly:
        I haven't worn earrings for a long time, that's
        why my earlobes grew back again.
To show him, she grasps one of her ears.
        For Whitsun feast, when we all want to look our
        best make ourselves look beautiful, I'm getting
        new earrings. The ones that Mom had, with
        garnets...


                                                            65

Rudolph looks at her. He doesn't think she's telling the
truth.

                            


58. RECTORY. THE PASTOR'S STUDY. INT/DAY
Marie comes in. She's wearing a nightshirt, her hair is
damp and sticks to her head. She looks sick and
feverish.
She closes the door quietly, then goes to her father's
desk and opens a few drawers. She ends up finding the
letter-opener. It has a hilt and looks like a small
sword.
She takes the letter-opener, goes to the birdcage, puts
the letter-opener down beside it and grabs the tiny
canary. As the bird chirps, she glances round at the
door, as if to make sure that nobody is coming.
        NARRATOR: A few days after Marie's fainting-fit
        that frightened us all, and that was followed by
        her feverish and debilitated state...
She takes the bird into her left hand so that its little
head is turned upwards, and picks up the letter-opener
with her right hand...


                            


59. ESTATE. STEWARD'S HOUSE. INT/DAY
The schoolteacher is led by the steward's wife to the
living room. She carries an apron and her sleeves are
rolled up. Apparently she was just preparing a cake, and
her sticky hands make her open the door with her elbow.
Because of the narrator's voice, we don't grasp what
they're saying, but we understand that she's asking him
to come in and wait for the person he wants to see, and
that she can't keep him company now.
       NARRATOR:...I went to see the steward, because I
       wanted to borrow the carriage for the Whitsun
       holidays again.
       Since my marriage proposal, Eva had written me
       once a week, and I got the feeling that she felt
       lost and alone in the city, and was asking me
       between the lines to come to see her again,
       despite of her father's interdiction.
       I wanted to spend Whitsun Saturday with her so
       that I could be back on Sunday again and prepare
       the confirmation feast with the pastor.
       The steward had gone to the sawmill, but was
       supposed to be back any minute. His wife, who
       was busy preparing for Whitsun, asked me into
       the living room and to wait there for his
       return.
                                                           66

The steward's wife has left the room. The schoolteacher
sits around, bored. After a while he gets up, goes to
the window and looks out.
The courtyard is empty.
Suddenly, the schoolteacher hears a female VOICE in the
next room SPEAKING softly.
He listens, then he goes to the wing door and looks
through the gap on the etched glass-window of the door
into the next room.
There, Liesl sits beside the cradle and talks quietly to
the baby.
The schoolteacher opens the door. Liesl sees him, gets
up and greets him politely with a curtsy:
        LIESL: Good morning, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Hello, Liesl..
Smiling, the schoolteacher goes to the cradle and looks
into it.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: He's cute..
       LIESL: Yes, he is.
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Do you like him.
       LIESL: Yes. Very much.

       SCHOOLTEACHER: He was very sick last winter, I
       was told.
        LIESL: Yes. Very sick. But the doctor cured him.
        With God's help.
PAUSE. The schoolteacher looks out the window to see if
the steward isn't coming.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:   Maybe,  I'll   pop  back   this
        evening.
        LIESL: I'm sure Father will be back for coffee
        at four.
She looks at the grandfather clock, that indicates
quarter to four. The schoolteacher thinks for a moment,
then he goes to the living room:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, I'll go sit down again next
        door.
       LIESL: Can I bring you something?      A   cup   of
       coffee. I'm sure it's ready.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling at her eagerness): No,
        no. Thanks.
He stands in the door:
        I'll sit down over there again and just wait.
He wants to close the door behind himself. Suddenly
                                                             67

       LIESL says: Sir!
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes?
        LIESL: Can dreams come true?
The schoolteacher smiles, surprised at the unexpected
question:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: That depends, why?
       LIESL(serious): On what?
       SCHOOLTEACHER (smile): On what does it depend?
       Well if you dream of getting the first prize at
       the school feast, and study hard for it, then
       your dream can come true.
        LIESL, shakes her head, quietly: That's not what
        I meant.
The schoolteacher feels that she has something on her
mind and asks, this time without irony:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, what did you mean then?
She looks at him, wondering if she should really discuss
it. He nods to encourage her.
        LIESL: I mean, if you dream something in your
        sleep, I mean, if you really dream it in your
        sleep, can it come true?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (also serious): Why, what did you
        dream?
She bows her head.
The schoolteacher thinks for a moment, then he goes over
to her.
        Come on, tell me. You have something on your
        mind, haven't you?
She shakes her bowed head. But suddenly, she starts to
cry:
        LIESL (crying): I always dream such horrible
        things.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (dear): Tell me what you've been
        dreaming?
She sobs, he takes out a handkerchief and hands it to
her:
        Take this. Now, calm down again. And then tell
        me what's going on.
Liesl takes the handkerchief, blows her nose and wipes
away her tears. She doesn't completely manage to hold
her tears back, and breathes haltingly. She hands the
handkerchief back to the schoolteacher.
        LIESL: Thanks.
The schoolteacher puts the handkerchief away with an
imperceptible smile and then says reassuringly:
                                                           68

        SCHOOLTEACHER: All right. Now go on.
The girl sniffles a couple of times again, then swallows
and says quietly:
        LIESL: I dreamt that the Hansi ­ the midwife's
        odd little boy ...
        SCHOOLTEACHER (reassuringly): I know, I know.
        LIESL: - ...that something very bad is going to
        happen to him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Something very bad?
Liesl nods eagerly.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Like what?
        LIESL: I don't know. Something like what
        happened to Sigi not long ago. But even worse.
She starts to cry again:
        But he's so sweet. He harms no one.
Touched, the schoolteacher puts his arm around Liesl's
shoulder.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: All right. All right. That was
        just a dream. You needn't take it so seriously.
        LIESL (crying): They always make fun of him,
        because he doesn't really...
        SCHOOLTEACHER (calmly): Yes, I know, but nobody
        will do him any harm, you can be sure of that.
Liesl can't calm down.
        Do you want my handkerchief back?
She shakes her head.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What gave you the idea that your
        dream would come true?
She just shakes her head, and keeps on crying. Then he
takes the handkerchief out again and hands it to her. As
she doesn't take it, he nudges her. She looks up,
confused. He holds the handkerchief again with a
cheerful nod. She takes it and blows her nose. The she
slowly calms down.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (now "reasonable" in order to
        "calm her down"): Dreams don't come true. Let
        alone that kind.
She shrugs her shoulders, as if she disagrees with what
he's saying. Her head bowed she stands before him,
holding his handkerchief.
She breathes a few more times, then says with an almost
"adult" voice:
        LIESL(serious): But sometimes my dreams do come
        true.

                                                           69

         SCHOOLTEACHER: What do you mean?
PAUSE.
         LIESL says: Last winter, before Putzl (she
         points to the baby) became ill, I dreamt that my
         brother put him beside the open window, so that
         he'd die.
         And the day the window was open and he caught a
         chill and he almost died.

The schoolteacher is completely perplexed. At first he
doesn't know what to say.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you saying there? That's
        complete nonsense!
Liesl bows her head again.

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Somebody probably didn't close
         the window properly.
         What gave you that idea? Why would your brother
         do such a thing?

         LIESL,(defiantly, as he's not believing her):
         Because he's jealous.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: And because you believe that, you
         dreamt it. It doesn't mean anything at all. It's
         just a coincidence.
         LIESL (keeping her head bowed): All right.

The schoolteacher bends over to catch her gaze.

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Look at me.


She looks at him reluctantly, maintaining her defiant
reserve.

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Don't tell such stories to
         anybody!
         You obviously don't realize the harm you can do
         with it.
Again she looks down at the floor.
        You didn't tell the story         to   your   parents,
        didn't you?
She shakes her head.
         All right then.
         Forget it quickly.   I   shall    forget     it,   too.
         Promise?
As she doesn't answer, he repeats:
        Promise?
                                                                   70

She nods almost imperceptibly.

        Good.
        Now can I have my handkerchief back...

He holds his hand out to her. Astonished she looks at
the handkerchief in her hands. She had forgotten it
completely, and gives it back the schoolteacher.
        Thank you.
He pockets the handkerchief.
        Now, we both have a secret. And you promise me
        that it will remain a secret between us. All
        right?
She nods reluctantly. He insists, seeks her gaze:
        Yes?!
        LIESL (reluctantly): Yes.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Well. All right then.
        You don't have to worry. Nothing will happen to
        Hansi.
        (smiling): Nobody is jealous of him.

She glances at him to see whether he's making fun of
her. He looks at her seriously and gives her a nod that
demands an answer. She nods briefly. But it isn't clear
whether she just does it to please him.
        Dreams don't come true. That only happens in
        fairy-tales. Forget all about it.
He looks at her, as she stands there, head bowed.
Finally he smiles and tries to "crack a joke" to make
the matter less serious:
        Do you know what they did to little girls who
        predicted the future in ancient times? They
        burned them at the stake as witches.
She looks up at him, round-eyed.

                            

60. RECTORY. THE PASTOR'S STUDY. INT/DAY
The pastor comes through the door, goes to his desk, and
is about to put down his briefcase.
The dead bird lies in the middle of the desk with its
wings spread out. The pastor's letter-opener is stuck in
its neck - only the hilt sticks out from its beak.

                            



                                                           71

61. STREET. EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher and Eva drive in the carriage. In the
background, we catch glimpses of the town.

        NARRATOR: We had arranged to meet at the town
        railway station, since Eva wanted to avoid being
        seen with me. She was living with distant
        relatives,   who    were    apparently   reporting
        regularly to Eva's parents about her life-style.
        She had become thinner which made her even
        prettier, and once again I was ravished by her
        mixture   of   shyness    and    almost  childlike
        outspokenness.
        EVA (imitating somebody): ..."...You want your
        hair parted r to the right or to the left?" "How
        about one parting to the left and one to the
        right"?
Both laugh heartily.
        All the people in the saloon were laughing their
        heads   off.    Even    Mr.    Murer,   who's   so
        distinguished that he never cracks a smile, had
        to laugh.
SHORT PAUSE, in which the laughter fades down.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Then, it isn't really so awful,
        is it?
        EVA: No. But sweeping up hair all day ­ honestly
        the twins were more fun, I must say.
        But it's all right. I can't really complain.

The schoolteacher looks at her sideways, smiling:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: No?
She looks at him, doesn't understand that he's trying to
make her complain about their forced separation, and
says cheerfully:
        EVA: No. Really.
The schoolteacher exchanges a smiling glance with her,
then looks back at the road:
        SCHOOLTEACHER (smiling): And apart from the
        twins, there's nothing you're missing?
She looks at him, surprised. Suddenly, she understands.
She shakes her head with a smile, then takes his hand
for a short moment, as if she were apologizing for her
lack of sensitivity.
        EVA: Oh, you of course!
He looks at her hand on his, but she already has
withdrawn it. Both seem very happy. After a few moments,
during which the horse keeps trotting, Eva leans against
the schoolteacher and puts her head against his
shoulder. But the shaking of the carriage on the rutted
road makes that position untenable and so they sit side
by side again and drive on. Finally
                                                             72

       EVA says: And how is the nurse? Does she only
       speak Italian?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: I   don't   know.   That's   what   the
       steward told me.
        EVA: I see.
At that moment the road crosses a brook, that runs
through a small wood. The schoolteacher steers the
carriage on to a trail that branches off the road after
the bridge.
        EVA: Where are you going?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: Over there, into the forest
       beside the brook. We can picnic over there. I
       brought a basket of food.
       EVA (softly): I don't want that.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (perplexed): Why?
Eva looks down and shakes her head. The schoolteacher
stops the carriage, turns to her:
        What's going on?
        EVA: Nothing. Please.
Now he understands. He smiles although he can't really
understand that she's been thinking such a thing of him.
Now he talks to her almost as to a child, astonished and
reassuringly.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:   But  I   don't  want   anything
        forbidden from you. I just wanted you to enjoy
        the picnic.
She looks up at him.
        EVA: Please.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (astonished): Do you think, I
        might want to bring disgrace on my future wife?
She keeps looking at him pleadingly. Finally he gives
in, slightly disappointed:
        All right then. I'll turn over there.
He drives on. After a few meters, Eva puts her hand on
his hands and on the reins. He stops the carriage, she
looks at him.
        EVA: Thanks.
He doesn't know what say. They look at each other.
Suddenly Eva leans forward and kisses him on the lips
very cautiously. They remain that way for a long while
without their bodies touching each other.
After separating, they forget at first to keep
breathing. Then, once the worst of the confusion has
abated, they both turn away from each other. The
schoolteacher lets the horse start trotting again, and
                                                                73

they sit side by side on the bumping vehicle, looking
straight ahead, quiet and overwhelmed by the happiness
of the moment.

                            


62. CHURCH INT/DAY
The church is packed.
The 8 candidates for confirmation are kneeling at the
Communion bench. One after the other, the pastor puts
the cup to their lips.

       PASTOR:
       Accept and drink!
       This is the blood of the New Testament,
       Shed for the forgiveness of your sins.

As he reaches Marie, who is kneeling fifth in line, he
hesitates a long moment. For so long, that this causes a
few irritated stares from the devout parish. Even more
than the other children, Marie is also numb with
excitement. It almost looks like she might faint again.
But then he holds out the cup to her too, and she
drinks:

       Accept and drink!
       That is the blood of the new will,
       spilled for you so that your sins         will   be
       forgiven.

He wipes the cup, where Marie's mouth drank ­ as he does
after each child - and goes on to the next one,
repeating the rite...


                            

63. FOREST EXT/NIGHT
Distant VOICES. At first incomprehensible. Gradually we
understand them better:
        VOICES: Hansi? Where are you? Give us a sign!
        Hansi, where are you?
Here and there silhouettes appear in the half-light.
Some carry lanterns, other torches. It takes some time
before they get nearer and become recognizable: they're
men and women from the village.
After a while
        MAN'S VOICE(calling): Over here. He's here.
We follow those running over: Bound to a tree is a small
boy. His whole head is wrapped up in rags. A small slit
has been left open so the nose can breathe. He MOANS.
                                                             74

A paper has been tied around his neck with a white
ribbon.
The people hurry toward the child, free the child of its
fetters. The child slumps down, his head is unwrapped,
covered in blood: it's the mongoloid son of the midwife.
Astonished, somebody reads the words written in block
letters on the paper):

        FOR I THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD,
        VISITING THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE
        CHILDREN TO THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH GENERATION
        OF THOSE WHO HATE ME.


                            


64. SCHOOL. INT/DAY
CORRIDOR.
Marie, Martin, Paul, Georg, and a couple of other
children are waiting at the classroom door. They remain
silent. They're listening.

        NARRATOR:   After    this   intricate  atrocity
        committed on the retarded boy, even the Baron
        was finally convinced that it would be more
        intelligent to call upon the professional help
        of the county's police force.
        So a few days later a couple of plainclothes
        policemen arrived and, after a visit to the
        several of the crime scenes, started to ask in
        various homes if anyone had noticed anything
        suspicious.

CLASSROOM

The two detectives question Liesl in the presence of the
schoolteacher and become more and more aggressive. Liesl
ends up crying.

        NARRATOR: After learning of Hansi's torture, I
        didn't think at first of what Liesl had told me.
        When it came back to my mind, I at first
        hesitated to tell the authorities about it.
        Because of such an absurd coincidence, I didn't
        want to jeopardize the reputation and inner
        peace of the steward's family.
        But when I heard that Hansi might loose his
        eyesight because of his injuries, one afternoon
        I made Liesl come to school and tell the police
        officers about her dream.
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: ...Thank God, we're not as
        stupid as you might think.

                                                           75

        LIESL (crying, desperate): But I only dreamt it.
PAUSE. The officers exchange an impatient look with the
schoolteacher, who himself doesn't really know what to
think of Liesl's story. He looks at her thoughtfully.
The police officer turns to the girl again:
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Now listen carefully! I'll
        give you a last chance: you tell me, who told
        you about the plan to torture the boy, and we
        won't tell anybody who told us. All right?
Liesl shakes her head desperately, crying again. The
police officer looks at the schoolteacher. The latter
doubts whether he should speak up. He feels sorry for
the girl. Finally, he says:
        SCHOOLTEACHER:   She's    already   dreamed   of
        something that has come true.
       FIRST POLICE OFFICER (ironic): Is that so? And
       what was it, if I may ask?
       SCHOOLTEACHER (wanting to spare her      talking
       about it): Something that happened       in her
       family.
       FIRST POLICE OFFICER (just as before): I see.
       Something to do with her family. And have you
       checked if it was true?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (irritated): No.
The police officer looks at him, grunts with disdain,
and turns to his colleague:
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER (scornfully): Well, all
        that may be true. Maybe we're really dealing
        here with an authentic clairvoyant, and we don't
        realize how lucky we are. Maybe we only need to
        ask her, who's behind all this. The we send her
        to bed, she dreams a bit, and tomorrow she tells
        us who did it. How about that? Everything's
        possible, isn't it?
Suddenly, he yells at the girl:
        Stop crying!
Liesl jumps up with fear. The police officer stands
right in front of her:

       Your deceitful whining won't work with me. I've
       got other ways to make you talk. I don't believe
       in witches and magicians, let alone that a
       chubby little girl like you has supernatural
       hallucinations. Therefore you'd better get used
       to the idea of telling the truth, because you
       won't bet rid of me until you've come clean. Is
       that clear?
       All right, and now we're going to visit your
       parents to see what they think of your version
       of the story.
                                                           76

He pulls the girl to her feet. She's thoroughly
intimidated, and sniffles faintly. Then he leads her
toward the door, at the same time turning to the
schoolteacher:
        I'd be grateful if you came too.
The schoolteacher finds the policeman's behavior toward
the child exaggeratedly aggressive, but he follows
reluctantly:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Of course.
The police officer opens the door to the

CORRIDOR

and almost bumps into a group of pupils that have
assembled there.
        FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Oooops! What do we have
        here?
           MARIE (kindly): Good afternoon. Good afternoon,
           Sir.
        CHILDREN (as before): Good afternoon. Good
        afternoon, Sir.
Obviously the schoolteacher didn't expect them, but
doesn't want to show it in front of the police.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon.
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER: Why are you eavesdropping?
        MARIE (politely): We saw from outside that the
        schoolteacher was having visitors. We didn't
        want to intrude. We were just waiting to talk to
        the schoolteacher.
PAUSE. The police officer looks at the schoolteacher:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What do you want?
        MARIE (as if she was too shy to talk in front of
        strangers: We wanted to ask you something about
        Hansi.
Again, the police officer looks at the schoolteacher.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What is it?
           MARIE (hesitates a moment, then "screws up her
           courage" and asks): We heard he isn't well. We
           just wanted to ask if we could be of any help.


                               




                                                              77

65. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE INT/NIGHT
The doctor carefully examines Hansi's wounds. Especially
the areas around eyes that are badly affected. The boy
moans softly.
The midwife stands beside him, trying to stay calm, but
she is paralyzed with fear, and visibly still in a state
of shock.
It's very quiet. The doctor speaks with a soothing,
almost tender voice to the child, who keeps on moaning:
         DOCTOR (softly): All right... Everything's all
         right, Hansi... I know, it hurts... You've got
         to be patient... everything will be fine
         again... everything...
He has finished his treatment (and has bandaged the
boy's eyes again), and wants get up. But Hansi's hand
clings to his, and holds him back. He hesitates a
moment. The doctor and the midwife exchange a brief
glance. Then, the doctor cautiously frees his hand from
the child's.
         I have to go now, Hansi. Don't worry, I'll be
         back tomorrow.
The boy moans louder and tries again to grasp the hand
of the doctor, who he can't see. Brief exchange of
glances between the doctor and the midwife, who ends up
sitting on Hansi's bed, taking the boy's hands.
         MIDWIFE: It's all right, Hansi. Don't be afraid.
         The Doctor will be back.
The doctor motions to the midwife that she should stay
with the child, and leaves the room silently and almost
hastily.


                            


66. LANDSCAPE WITH A BROOK AND PASTURES EXT/DAY
Sitting at a brook, Sigi, Ferdinand and Georg have cut
willow twigs with their pocketknives and are now carving
whistles out of them. Their feet dangle in the water,
they're concentrated on their work.
Georg is the first to have finished. Proudly he tries it
out, but the little whistle doesn't sound very good. He
hides his disappointment, and keeps on carving to
improve the sound.
Then Sigi's whistle is ready and it sounds very good.
Sigi is delighted. After a short and proud look over to
his rivals, he leans back into the grass and keeps on
whistling.
Georg looks with irritation at the "braggart", and keeps
on carving. Then he gives it another try, but the
whistle doesn't sound much better than before.
Sigi's   whistling   makes   Georg's  seem   ridiculous.
Ferdinand looks at Georg with a gloating grin.

                                                            78

Suddenly Georg pounces on Sigi and tries to grab his
whistle. Sigi fights back and refuses to let go.
Ferdinand also gets up and watches the two, grinning.

Even if Sigi is no longer the weakling he used to be
before his stay in Italy, Georg, who is three years
older than him, is much stronger: with the weight of his
whole body he charges at Sigi, making him fall backward
into the shallow water of the brook, and takes his
whistle away.
The shock almost knocks out Sigi, and though the stream
isn't deep, half of his head lies under the flowing
water. Georg sees the danger, but his pride prevents him
from helping him, as it means admitting his own unjust
behavior. For a moment he hesitates, a helpless and
defiant grin on his face. But Ferdinand has already
jumped into the water and pulls out Sigi, who shakes his
head to fully come to his senses.
Ferdinand looks up at Georg, who is standing on the
bank, still holding the whistle in his hand. Then Georg
points his finger at him, and says furiously and
guiltily.
        GEORG (threatening): If you rat on me, you'll be
        sorry!


                            


67. RECTORY. STUDY. INT/DAY
The pastor sits at his desk, working. A KNOCK is heard.
        PASTOR: Come in!
Florian comes in, hesitantly. In his hand, he carries a
birdcage (we've already seen it in Scene 49 in the boy's
bedroom at night). In the cage is the bird that Florian
had found on Thanksgiving day, and who has recovered in
the meantime.
        PASTOR: Yes?
The boy looks embarrassed. He glances at his father,
then comes over with the cage and puts it carefully on
his father's desk. As Florian approaches, the pastor
looked on, amazed. After putting down the cage, Florian
steps back a little, then stops, his head slightly
bowed.
        PASTOR (not really understanding): What is it?
        What do you want?
        FLORIAN (softly): For Pipsi. (PAUSE. Then even
        more softly): Because Father is sad.
The pastor looks at him, doesn't know how to react.
Then,   with  a   hoarse   voice  and  trying to  look
indifferent, he says:
        PASTOR: Thank you.
                                                           79

        FLORIAN (as apprehensive in front of his
        father's perceptible emotion): You're welcome,
        Father.
For a moment, neither of them knows what to do. Then the
boy leaves the room.
The pastor follows him with his eyes. Then, he sits
down. He tries to keep his composure, but in the end he
bursts into tears. He sobs haltingly, trying hard not
let it be heard.


                                

68.THE STEWARD'S HOUSE INT/EXT/DAY

THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.
Georg stands at the window and looks down at the

COURTYARD

Coming from   the   manor,   the   steward   is   walking   over
briskly.

THE CHILDREN'S ROOM.
Georg leaves the window and sits down at his table,
doing his homework.
We hear the FRONT DOOR opening downstairs, then the
father's hasty STEPS on the stairs.
Finally, the father appears in the door. He's out of
breath, furious, and tries to speak quietly
        STEWARD: Give me that whistle!
Georg looks at his father, "not understanding".
        GEORG: I beg your pardon?
        STEWARD (forcedly, with threatening calm): Give
        me that whistle!
        GEORG: What whistle?
At this, the steward pounces on the boy and smacks him
so hard that he falls out of his chair.
        Give it to me!
        GEORG (on the ground): What whistle?
The steward yanks him up and shoves him against the
wall. Georg stumbles over the table which is standing in
the way, and lies back on the table top, trying to
protect his face with his hands.
        STEWARD: Give away it to me, or I'll kill you.
        GEORG (half moaning): I have no whistle.
The steward lets go of him and starts to beat                him
furiously.
                                                                   80

        GEORG (screaming): Ouch! ...Ouch!!
        STEWARD (beat): You bastard, you wretch!
        GEORG (scream): Ouch! Ouch! !! Please don't
At that moment, attracted by the noise, Emma, the
mother, appears:
        EMMA: For God's sake, Georg, what are you doing?
        What has the boy done?
The mother's arrival has snapped the father out of his
blind rage. He glances at her, then turns to the boy
again, breathless with excitement, but forcing himself
to be calm:
        STEWARD: For the last time: give it to me!
        GEORG (almost crying with pain): But I don't
        know what you mean, Father.
The mother looks uncomprehendingly from one to the
other, then turns pleadingly to her husband:
        EMMA: What's going on? What are you talking
        about?
        STEWARD (to Georg): You know exactly what I
        mean.
Again the mother looks from one to the other, trying to
save the situation:
        EMMA: But if he says so! Georg! What's going on?
The steward turns to her, annoyed by her insistence,
looks at her for a long moment, then at Georg again and
turns on his heels and leaves the room.

STAIRWELL.

The steward runs down the stairs. The mother follows
him.
        EMMA (excited): Georg! Please wait! What did the
        boy do?! Please, tell me! Why are you so
        furious?
She reaches the steward as he is just about to open the
front door and places herself in front of him.
        EMMA (imploring, "reasonable"): Georg! Please!
        Calm down. If you could tell me...
        STEWARD (also "reasonable", in order to get rid
        of her): Please don't interfere. Leave me alone
        now! I have to go back to the Baron. He...
At that moment we hear from upstairs the full SOUND of
Sigi's whistle s from above, wild and lasting.
For a moment, the steward is paralyzed, then he seizes
the horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe and
dashes upstairs. We hear him thrashing the boy in the

                                                           81

room, and soon the WHISTLING is replaced by Georg's
SCREAMS OF PAIN
After a short hesitation, the mother runs upstairs after
her husband, and we now hear her trying in vain trying
to control her husband.
        EMMA: Georg! Please! Stop it! Don't kill him...!


                             


69. ESTATE. DINING ROOM. COURTYARD. INT/EXT/NIGHT
The meal is over. The Baroness watches the maid clearing
the table and putting everything away on a tray.
The Baron has stood up, standing with his back to his
wife. He pours himself a glass of brandy.
        BARON: ... with the birches over there in Aigen
        that should make about six-thousand cubic
        meters. Working steadily, they should have
        finished it within three weeks. If until the end
        of the month we...
The maid has left with the tray.
        BARONESS (interrupts him): I won't stay here.
         BARON (doesn't understand): What did you say?
         BARONESS: I won't stay here.
         BARON (turns around to her): What do you mean
         BARONESS: What I mean is that I shall leave with
         the children.
         BARON: What do you mean: you're leaving with the
         children?
         BARONESS:   Come  on,   Armin!  It's   not   that
         difficult to understand, is it?
PAUSE.
         BARON: May I ask you how you plan to do that?
         BARONESS (quiet): I don't know yet. But in any
         case, we're leaving this place.
         BARON (sarcastic): We.
Look of the Baroness ("I don't need that kind of
irony").
         BARONESS: Yes.
The maid enters to clear the rest of the table. It leads
to a longer PAUSE. The Baron drinks his brandy, goes to
the window, waits. As the maid leaves the room, she
looks at the Baroness inquiringly:


                                                             82

         BARONESS (to the maid): I don't need you any
         longer. Thank you.
         MAID: Good night, Baroness. Good night, Baron.
        BARONESS: Good night.
Even after the maid has left, they remain SILENT for
quite a long while. Finally, she says
        BARONESS: I returned from Italy only out of
        deceny toward you. I wanted to give us a chance.
         BARON (turns around): You wanted me "to give me
         a chance"?!
         BARONESS: Yes.
         BARON: Well, that's brilliant! And did I miss my
         chance? Or what?
PAUSE.
         BARONESS (quietly): Do you think that will help
         us solve the problem?
         BARON: What?
         BARONESS: Your sarcasm.
        BARON: Actually, what is the problem that has to
        be solved?
The Baroness looks at him, then gets up and wants to
leave the room.
        BARON (suddenly yelling): You stay here!!
She turns around, looks at him.
        BARON (softer): You only leave this room if I
        tell you to do so.
She looks at him.
        BARONESS: Fine.
She goes back to her chair and sits down.
         BARONESS: I wanted to spare you this, but you
         force me to do it:
         During our stay with Uncle Edoardo I fell in
         love with a man. He's from Lombardy, he works in
         the banking business and helped Uncle Edoardo in
         a financial matter. He courted me and was also
         very fond of the children. If Sigi has blossomed
         and grown so healthy, it's largely thanks to
         him.
         Despite all this, we came back.
         Because I feel committed to you. But I can't
         stand this place any longer. Not so much for me
         personally, though I can't say that life with
         you is exactly thrilling for a woman of my age.
         But if I leave this place, it's because I don't
                                                            83

         want Sigi, and later the twins, to grow up in
         surroundings dominated by malice, envy, apathy
         and brutality. What happened with Sigi's whistle
         was the last straw. I'm sick and tired of
         persecutions, threats and perverse acts of
         revenge.
PAUSE.
         BARON: Did you sleep with him?
         BARONESS   (laughing   scornfully):   You   don't
         understand anything.
         BARON: Did you sleep with him?
PAUSE.
         BARONESS (quietly): No. I didn't sleep with him.
PAUSE.
        BARON: You're lying, aren't you?
The Baroness looks at him. Then she gets up, about to
leave the room again. At the same moment, somebody
KNOCKS at the door. After a short gesture of irritation
        BARON (irked): Come in!
The steward appears.
        STEWARD: Good evening. Could I talk to you for a
        moment, Baron?
         BARON (annoyed): Can't it wait until tomorrow?
        STEWARD:   It's  really   urgent.   Normally,  I
        wouldn't have disturbed you so late.
Annoyed, the Baron leaves the room with him. As he goes
out, the steward greets the Baroness with a nod.
Once the door is closed, she stops for a moment, goes to
the window, and looks out pensive. She ends up going to
the small bar and pours herself a glass of brandy. Her
hands are shaking a little. She drinks from the glass,
goes back to the window and looks out waiting, taking a
sip from now and then. Below in the

COURTYARD

a few people walk around nervously. But it doesn't look
particularly unusual. A saddled horse is led into the
stable. Finally, the door of the

DINING ROOM
opens again. The Baron comes back inside. He looks
distressed. The Baroness doesn't know whether this is
the result of her conversation, or of the message
brought by the steward. The Baron paces a few steps,
pondering, then glances at his wife. Finally, she asks
        BARONESS: What's going on?

                                                             84

       BARON: They've shot the heir to the throne of
       Austria. In Sarajevo.


                            


70. VILLAGE AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE EXT/DAY
The same setting as in Scene 57. The countryside in all
its summer splendor.

       NARRATOR: The news spread around the village
       like wildfire. What would the consequences be?
       The first person who spoke the word WAR, was
       severely contradicted. But once it had been
       uttered, it remained at the center of all our
       thoughts in a curiously stubborn way.
       I wanted to go to the town as quickly as
       possible, in order to discuss it with Eva, what
       we should do if war broke out. Perhaps her
       father would now agree to an earlier marriage.
       I asked the Baroness for the bicycle, with which
       Eva had visited her parents some time ago. The
       following weekend I planned use it to ride to
       town and see her.


                            


71. ESTATE EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher is pushing the bicycle out of the
manor house. He says good-bye to a maid, who closes the
door behind him. Some SHOUTING o.s. makes him look
toward the steward's house: the steward comes out with
the midwife, and it looks like he's throwing her out
with a flood of angry insults.
        NARRATOR: When I went to the estate on Friday
        evening to pick up the bicycle, so I could take
        it with me to the school, and get going early,
        as the trip was a quite long one, I witnessed a
        strange confrontation:
        STEWARD: ...completely mad! Go if you want.
        He'll throw you out on your ear.
        Slandering other people and creating trouble.
        That's all we need now!
        Get out and never come back again! This is
        unbelievable!
        Go ahead, do whatever you think you have to do!
        You're hysterical!
        MIDWIFE (simultaneously): ...I'll go to the
        Baron. We'll see what he says. You won't silence
        me. Who do you think you are?! You'll see. I'll

                                                           85

        tell him that you tried to prevent me from
        giving the police a statement.
Angrily the steward slams the door behind him. At first
the midwife doesn't know what to do. Finally she turns
away from the door and starts to cross the yard. There,
she sees the schoolteacher. She comes over to him.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Good afternoon, Mrs. Wagner.
        What's happening?
         MIDWIFE (very excited): Good afternoon. Can I
         borrow your bicycle?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: It's not mine.
         MIDWIFE: Could I borrow it just the same?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I just borrowed it myself.      I
         going to ride to town, to see my fiancée..
         MIDWIFE: Please! Lend it to me!
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Why do you need it? Where do you
         want to go?
         MIDWIFE: I must go to town.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: What for?
         MIDWIFE: I asked the steward for a carriage, but
         that stubborn fool won't agree to anything.
PAUSE.
         Please! Lend me the bicycle.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Why? What is going on?
After hesitating a while
        MIDWIFE: I have to go to the police in town. I
        now know who committed all these crimes.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (flabbergasted): Who?
         MIDWIFE: Will you let me have the bicycle?
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Why don't you tell me?
         MIDWIFE: From now on I shall only talk to the
         police. I won't let them insult me (turning to
         the steward's house): As you just saw.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Can't the doctor can lend you his
         horse?
        MIDWIFE: I don't know how to ride.
The schoolteacher looks at her inquisitively, because he
still doesn't understand what it's all about, but she
doesn't respond, and says:

                                                            86

         MIDWIFE: Please! Believe me! (She hesitates and
         adds, now quietly and imploringly):
         My son told me who did it to him. He may loose
         his eyesight.
         Please, you let me have the bicycle!

The schoolteacher looks at her. The midwife looks
pitiful: she tries to smile at him pleadingly, tears are
streaming down her face.
Finally, he gives the bicycle to her. She grabs it
quickly, says
         Thanks!
and rides away. The schoolteacher remains behind, alone.
He stands pensive, then he goes slowly back to the
village.
         NARRATOR: The state that woman was in, who I
         knew was level-headed, had deeply impressed me.
         What had her son told her, that she didn't dare
         tell anybody?


                             


72. VILLAGE STREET. EXT/DUSK
The schoolteacher goes home.
TRACKING SHOT.
        NARRATOR: With each step I took from the estate
        back to the school, I felt more foolish for
        having given away the bicycle.
As he passes the midwife's house, he sees behind the
fence in the garden, half hidden behind the bushes,
Marie and a few other children. The shutters of the
house are closed.
        As I passed the midwife's house, I saw Marie,
        Martin, and a few other children in the garden.
The schoolteacher stops, watches the children. After a
few moments, they notice that somebody is watching them.
        MARIE: Good evening, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening, Marie.
         CHILDREN: Good evening, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: What are you doing here?
         MARIE: We wanted to see how Hansi was doing.
PAUSE.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: But can't       you   see   that   the
         shutters are closed.
PAUSE.

                                                                 87

         MARIE: Yes. We were worried. We saw Mrs. Wagner
         riding off on a bicycle. So we wondered what had
         happened to Hansi.
PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Go home now. Nobody said you
        could come in here.
The children go out slowly. They open the wooden gate in
the fence, and go out into the street. They're visibly
embarrassed at being caught by the schoolteacher when
they were doing something wrong. Some avoid the
schoolteacher's eyes, while others mutter a greeting, as
if they wanted to say goodbye, as they went away. The
schoolteacher looks annoyed. As Marie steps out of the
garden door, he says:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: You better go back home now,
        hurry.
Marie doesn't seem to feel guilty at all. Again she
greets him politely.
        MARIE: Good evening, Teacher.
        SCHOOLTEACHER (reluctantly): Good evening.
The children go away. The schoolteacher also goes on his
way. After a few steps he turns around and looks at the
children, then walks on.

         NARRATOR: Then I thought of Liesl's dream again.
         What if Liesl hadn't dreamt, but had known, that
         Hansi was going to be tortured. Whose crimes did
         she know of? Whose name had she refused to
         reveal?
         The strong interest of the children in Hansi
         seemed strange to me, considering that they had
         usually refused to have any contact with him
         because of his disability, or only dealt with
         him in a rather disdainful manner.

The schoolteacher stops. He ponders about this. Then he
goes back to the midwife's house.

         Suddenly I wondered why the midwife had closed
         the shutters of the house. Nobody in the village
         ever shut their house. Why had the midwife
         locked her boy in?

He has reached the front of the house again. Indeed,
with its closed shutters, it looks uninhabited. Only
because of the tidy little front garden, could one tell
that somebody lived there.
The schoolteacher opens the garden gate and goes up to
the house. He tries to open the door and then the
shutters. Everything is well shut. He peers through the
cracks in the wooden shutters.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Hansi? Can you hear me? Hansi!
                                                            88

Nobody seems to answer. For a short moment the
schoolteacher disappears behind the house, apparently
looking for another way to get inside. But he soon comes
back without having found anything.
        NARRATOR: If the midwife couldn't take care of
        him, she would have entrusted the boy to me, or
        to the doctor. But since the night he was
        mistreated, I hadn't seen him again.
He leaves the midwife's house and hurries to the
neighboring house, the doctor's.
        I decided to ask the doctor directly.
He enters the property, goes up to the entrance and
rings. Nobody answers. He rings again, then he sees a
note tacked up:

          The doctor's practice is closed
                until further notice

                            


73. RECTORY. INT/NIGHT
STAIRWELL.
The pastor's wife and the schoolteacher stand before the
closed front door.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: His daughter? Wasn't she with you
        at your school?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say anything?
The schoolteacher shakes his head. They both remain
silent and pensive.

        SCHOOLTEACHER: I have a request.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Yes?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Could I ask Marie and Martin?
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to wait for my
        husband? He's at the church. The service will be
        over in a quarter of an hour. But if you insist.
        Please, come in.
She opens the door

LIVING ROOM

and points to a chair.
        Please be seated. Please. I'll fetch the kids
        for you.

                                                           89

She leaves the room. The schoolteacher remains standing.
Waiting.
Finally, the pastor's wife comes back with the two
children.
         MARIE and MARTIN: Good evening, Sir.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Good evening.
PAUSE.
         THE PASTOR'S WIFE: Don't you want to sit down?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (who hasn't thought of it): Yes.
        Perhaps. With pleasure.
They   sit   down.   The  children   sit  opposite   the
schoolteacher.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Can I offer you something? ,
        (smiling faintly): A cup of coffee? Like during
        the piano lessons
First the schoolteacher wants to refuse, then he decides
to accept so as to get rid of the woman, and be alone
with the children.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, with pleasure. That's very
        kind of you.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: I'll be back in a minute.
The schoolteacher turns to the children:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you know that the Doctor was
        leaving Eichwald?
Short PAUSE.
        MARIE: No.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: But you don't seem surprised at
         my question.
         MARIE: Our mother told us when she came to fetch
         us.
         SCHOOLTEACHER:   And   Xenia   didn't    tell    you
         anything about it?
        MARIE: No.
She looks at Martin who confirms it:
        MARTIN: No.
         SCHOOLTEACHER (incredulously): Not a word? It's
         very unusual for a child not to tell his
         classmates before going away on a trip.
         MARIE (unimpressed):   Xenia   never    talks   much
         about home.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well, that's something completely
         different?!

                                                                90

Apparently Marie doesn't take it as a further question,
and remains silent.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I get the feeling you're hiding
        something from me.
         MARIE: What?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: That's what I'd really like to
        know.
SILENCE. Then the schoolteacher turns to Martin:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: When you were looking for Hansi a
        while ago, what did you want from him?
Short PAUSE.
        MARIE : We were worried. He's ill.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm asking Martin.
PAUSE.
        MARTIN: Yes. He isn't well. And since his mother
        is gone... we thought, we should go and pay him
        a visit.
The schoolteacher realizes that he won't get any further
this way.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Did you ever ask yourselves who
        could have treated Hansi that way?
PAUSE. Then the schoolteacher adds:
        And Sigi?
PAUSE.
        And who tied the wire in the doctor's garden?
        And who set fire to the barn?
        Well?!
PAUSE.
        MARIE: Yes, of course we wondered.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Well?
        MARIE: We discussed it with Father. He said it
        must be a sick person.
PAUSE. The schoolteacher doesn't know how to go on.
        SCHOOLTEACHER:    Sigi   was    with    you at
        Thanksgiving. And so was Hansi.
PAUSE.
        MARIE: I don't understand.
With demonstrative helplessness she looks at the
schoolteacher, then at her brother, and again at the
schoolteacher: Shaking her head and shrugging her
shoulders.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: What did they do to you?
         MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): Who?

                                                           91

         SCHOOLTEACHER: Sigi and Hansi?
         MARIE (as above): Why?
         SCHOOLTEACHER:   They    obviously   were   being
         punished. For what?
         MARIE (as above): I don't know.
         SCHOOLTEACHER: Liesl foresaw that Hansi would be
         punished? What for?
         MARIE (as above): I don't know.
PAUSE.
         Why do you ask us?
PAUSE.
         SCHOOLTEACHER:   You're  an   intelligent   girl,
         Marie. Don't try and play dumb.
PAUSE.
         MARIE: I don't understand you, Sir. You should
         talk with Father about this or with Mother.
         Shall I go get her?

The schoolteacher looks at her.
        MARIE: Martin, would you please get her?
Martin gets up and is about to go to the door.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Stay here, Martin: I'll talk to
        your parents when I consider it's the right
        time. Now, I'm talking to you. And I expect you
        tell me the truth.
Martin sits down after exchanging a glance with Marie
again.
        Where were you on the evening Hansi was found?
         MARIE (doesn't seem to understand): At home.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I mean after the confirmation?
At that moment, the pastor's wife enters with the coffee
cups on a tray.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: There we are. The coffee will be
        ready in a minute.
She puts the tray on the table. Turns to the
schoolteacher, friendly as ever:
        Were the children able to help you?
The schoolteacher looks at Marie, then he answers:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I'm afraid not. They don't know
        anything, either.
         PASTOR'S WIFE: That's really odd. A doctor can't
         vanish into thin air. What about his patients?

                                                             92

        (to the children) Didn't his daughter tell you
        anything at school?
The schoolteacher gets up, ready to leave.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: No. I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
       PASTOR'S WIFE: Why don't you stay? My husband
       will be back any moment, and the coffee is
       almost ready.
       SCHOOLTEACHER: That's very kind of you, but I'm
       really worried about the midwife's son.
       PASTOR'S WIFE: And she didn't say when she'd be
       back?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I didn't ask her. She caught me
        off guard. She was completely panicked.
The pastor's wife shakes her head thoughtfully.
        PASTOR'S WIFE: Strange... Wait a second! I think
        that's my husband.
And indeed, outside one can hear the FRONT DOOR and then
the STEPS of the pastor. The wife goes to the door to
open it. The pastor appears.
        PASTOR (surprised to see the schoolteacher):
        Good evening.
       PASTOR'S WIFE: Good evening. The schoolteacher
       has been anxiously waiting for you.
       PASTOR (to the schoolteacher): Yes?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes. I'd like to have a quick
        chat with you.
The pastor doesn't really understand what can be so
urgent, and why the schoolteacher, which was unusual for
him, came to see him in the evening. But he remains
friendly:
        PASTOR: Please. We'd better go to my study. It's
        quieter there.
The schoolteacher nods to the pastor's wife, who is glad
that the required meeting can now take place, while the
pastor walks ahead with an inviting gesture. As the
pastor opens the door of the STUDY, he asks:
        PASTOR: Well, how can I help you?
They enter the room and the pastor offers the
schoolteacher a chair. Then he realizes that the windows
are open and closes them, as the schoolteacher starts to
speak.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I spoke to the midwife today: she
        said she now knew who tortured her son.
       PASTOR ("who"?): She does?

                                                           93

       SCHOOLTEACHER: She'll only     tell   the   police.
       That's why she went to town.
       PASTOR (doesn't quite understand        what    the
       schoolteacher is getting at): Well?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: She left the boy behind alone and
       has locked the whole house.
       PASTOR: Locked it?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (nods): I went to the doctor's
        next door to ask him what was going on, whether
        he was taking care of the child or... But
        there's a piece of paper saying that the
        practice is closed until further notice. The
        doctor and his children have disappeared.
The pastor has almost finished closing the windows. He
pauses and turns to the schoolteacher:
        PASTOR (stunned): What do you mean?
        SCHOOLTEACHER (shrugs): I don't know. I thought
        you might have been informed. That's why I'm
        here.
After a startled PAUSE the pastor shakes his head:
        PASTOR: I have no idea.
He   finishes  closing   the  windows.   Then   he  goes
thoughtfully over to the schoolteacher and sits down in
front of him.
        PASTOR: Xenia... Wasn't his daughter in school?
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Yes, she was. She never mentioned
        anything.
SILENCE. The pastor ponders. Then, after a while
        SCHOOLTEACHER : I asked Marie and Martin. They
        both know nothing either.
        PASTOR   (looks   up   to    the  schoolteacher,
        "stunned"): Why should they?
The schoolteacher almost dodges speaking further:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: I don't know. When I went to the
        midwife's place, they were there with a few
        others in the garden.
       PASTOR ("doesn't understand"): To do what?!
       SCHOOLTEACHER: They were looking for the boy.
       PASTOR (as before): Why?
       SCHOOLTEACHER: They wanted to help him.
       PASTOR: So what

                                                             94

         SCHOOLTEACHER (hesitates, then says): I don't
         know how to say it. I have the feeling they're
         hiding something.
         PASTOR (refuses): What?
         SCHOOLTEACHER (keeps on searching hesitantly for
         his words): I don't know. (finally he dares to
         come out with his suspicion): When the doctor
         had his accident... last year, you remember,
         Suddenly the children were in his garden.
         Supposedly, in order to help Xenia.
        PASTOR (doesn't understand): Yes... and?
The schoolteacher, uneasy, breathes hard. He knows that
his suspicions will seem odd, and senses that the pastor
won't go along with then.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: Nothing. I had forgotten it.
        Today, it came back to my mind again.
         PASTOR (as before): I don't understand.
PAUSE.
        SCHOOLTEACHER: When they found the Baron's
        son... the last time he had been seen, he was
        with the children.
The pastor looks at the schoolteacher, then his face
slowly freezes to a mask of refusal:
        PASTOR: What are you getting at?
Of course, the schoolteacher notices the reaction. But
he has already gone too far to backtrack. After a PAUSE
he goes on:
        SCHOOLTEACHER: A couple of days before Hansi was
        almost beaten to death, the steward's daughter
        had predicted precisely that to me. Supposedly,
        she had dreamed it. The police thinks she's
        lying. Who told her about it? Who announced it
        to her?
LONG SILENCE. Finally, the pastor gets up, takes a few
steps, then, after another PAUSE, turns again to the
schoolteacher. His face is ashen, and he can hardly
speak:
        PASTOR: If I understand you correctly, you're
        saying that your pupils, my children included,
        committed these crimes. Is that right?
The schoolteacher has little affirmative and regretful
gesture. He feels extremely uncomfortable in this role.
Another PAUSE. Then, the pastor continues:
        Do you realize what you're saying?
PAUSE. He breathes heavily, tries to control his
emotions.
        Do you know...
                                                            95

His voice fails. His chin starts to shake, tears flood
his eyes, and he suddenly turns away.
The schoolteacher who has been looking at him, now looks
down and stays where he is without saying a word.
After a while, the pastor has regained enough control of
himself to turn back to the schoolteacher:
        I assume that I'm the first person to whom
        you've uttered this monstrosity.
Mute reaction of the schoolteacher ("of course").
        If you ever dare to bother other people with it,
        if you publicly denounce respectable families
        and their children in this abject way, I shall
        make sure -- and you can take my word for it --
        that you will go to prison.
The schoolteacher wants to reply something, but the
pastor continues:
        I've seen quite a lot during my work as a
        pastor, but I've never come across anything as
        repulsive as this.
He looks at the schoolteacher for a moment with disdain:

       One can tell that you have no children.
       Otherwise,   you    wouldn't   stoop   to   such
       viciousness. You have a sick mind. I wonder how
       the school authorities could let you loose among
       those poor creatures. I'll have a word with the
       authorities at the proper time.
       And now please leave my house. I never want to
       see you here again.


                            


74. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAY
The steward, his wife and the schoolteacher try to break
into the house.
First the steward tries several keys. As this doesn't
work, they break down a door at the rear of the house
and go in.
        NARRATOR: The midwife never came back. I waited
        until the morning, two days later. Then, I went
        to the manor house to inform the Baron. He
        referred me to the steward and said to open the
        house immediately and to look after the disabled
        boy.


                            

75. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE INT/DAY
BACK TO THE SCENE.
                                                           96

The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife search
through the house. Because of the closed shutters, its
rooms are veiled in half-light. Several times they call
"Hansi"!, "Hello, Hansi, where are you"?, which can
faintly be heard under the narrator's voice.
In the midwife's bedroom, the schoolteacher notices a
photo: it shows the doctor, an unknown woman, and Xenia
as a small girl.
The boy is nowhere to be found.
        NARRATOR: I had never come to the midwife's
        house and felt uncomfortable at the idea of
        barging into somebody else's house without
        asking. It was strange, but we were still
        seeking and calling out anxiously Hansi's name,
        and I already knew, that we were searching in
        vain. Anyone who knew the midwife also knew how
        devoted she was to her disabled child, and that
        she would never have left her wounded Hansi all
        alone.
The three searchers, who have found nothing, meet again
in the stairwell.


                            


76. THE MIDWIFE'S HOUSE EXT/DAY
The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife come out
from behind the house, leave the property and go their
separate ways on the street. All that is left is the
empty house with its closed shutters.

       NARRATOR: During the next few weeks, the village
       gossip-factory worked overtime.
       Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi's father. He
       and the midwife had tried to abort the child so
       that the shame of their relationship wouldn't be
       found out, and that's how the child became
       disabled. Others even went as far as to claim
       that there was something fishy about the death
       of the doctor's wife, and that they wouldn't be
       surprised, if the two weren't responsible for
       it.


                            

77. MONTAGE: EXT/DAY
The houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, the
street before the school, the estate's administrative
buildings and the manor house.
There is nobody to be seen.

       NARRATOR: Whoever had lynched the boy obviously
       knew about the hidden crimes of his parents.
                                                          97

       Suddenly it seemed even possible that the doctor
       and the midwife, as potential murderers, were
       also the perpetrators of all the other crimes.
       It was suspected, that the doctor had wanted to
       spare his legitimate children and himself public
       disclosure of his guilt, and had therefore fled
       with them. Apparently he had taken the disabled
       boy with him out of guilt. Understandably
       enough, he had left behind his accomplice and
       the mother of the disgraced child.
       The fact that it was on a bicycle that she tried
       to catch up with the man who had happily
       escaped, was the cause of a great deal of
       laughter.

The deserted estate is decorated with flags.
        On July 28th Austria declared war on Serbia. It
        was followed on Saturday, August 1rst, by the
        German declaration of war on Russia, and on
        France the following Monday.




                            


  78.CHURCH INT/DAY

HIGH ANGLE SHOT:
The villagers are about to take their seats. The smaller
children are sitting with their parents on the pews.
All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militia
are in uniform. Flags are planted. Joyful excitement
reigns everywhere.
Once the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness and
their son Sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in the
front row.

       NARRATOR: On the Sunday between those dates, the
       whole village came to the festive service.
       An atmosphere of expectation and departure was
       in the air. From now on nothing would be the
       same.
       Only a few days ago everybody would have called
       the life they lived as God's will, worthy of
       being lived, and would have shunned any change.
       The strange joy with which the coming war was
       greeted, showed that this certainty of order and
       security was based on very shaky foundations.

CLOSE-UPS:
Of all the adult leading characters of the film, aside
from the doctor and the midwife. Also of Eva and her
father.
                                                           98

       In the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that was
       flaring up, the events that had shaken Eichwald,
       had become an irrelevant.
       In the face of the coming war, Eva's father had
       taken his daughter back and, at her pleading,
       had come to Eichwald to cast an eye at the place
       where his future son-in-law was living and
       working. The prospect, that I might soon call
       this beloved creature my wife, turned this day
       also into a solemn day for me.
       The pastor never mentioned our conversation
       again. Our relationship was limited to what was
       required professionally. He apparently never
       went through with his threat to denounce me to
       the school-authorities.

MORE CLOSE-UPS.
The schoolteacher on the gallery lifts his hands and
cues them to begin. They start SINGING. We see them one
after the other. At the end we see Marie: she wears the
white ribbon in her hair.

       Today, more than a quarter of a century later,
       toward the end of my life, and several years
       after the end of a second war that was to change
       this world in a more cruel and radical way than
       the first one, the one we faced at the time, I
       wonder if the events of those days and our
       silence about them, weren't the germ of the
       tragedy toward which we were heading.
       Didn't we all know secretly what had happened in
       our midst? Hadn't we, in a way, made it possible
       by closing our eyes? Didn't we keep our mouths
       shut because otherwise we would have had to
       wonder if the misdeeds of these children, of our
       children, weren't actually the result of what
       we'd been teaching them?

The image of Marie singing with the shining white ribbon
freezes.

       I was drafted at the start of the third year of
       the war. After the war, I sold the house in
       Grundbach that I had inherited from my father,
       who had died in the meantime, and with the money
       I opened a tailor's shop in the town, where I
       still live now.
       I never saw anybody from the village again.

Over the FREEZE FRAME the END CREDITS begin. Once the
narrator's VOICE has gone silent, we listen to Bach's
solemn chorale. The children sing beautifully.

SUPER:  A TRUE STORY - MYSTIC HARBOR CONNECTICUT 1994

CREDITS OVER

Wind on the water.  Soaring gulls and sand pipers glide
over the pilings and sagging bulkheads.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Though I hadn't seen or spoken to
          Sheldrake in over thirty years, it
          seemed impossible that his heart was
          the thing that had finally failed
          him...


INT.  LATE MODEL CAR - SAME

CHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind
the wheel.  He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street
that leads to the wharf.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          I never got close to him, nobody
          did.  But by the time we made Tampa,
          I was sure I knew who he was, that I
          understood what he saw, what
          nourished his soul and tested his
          faith...


EXT.  WHARF - DAY

Chuck stares out across the harbor.  In the distance, the
echoes of singing masts.  Shrouds and canvas softly ping.
The small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their
moorings.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          He had taken us to worship, where,
          what was for him, the holiest of
          holies.  And, for us too by the
          end...


EXT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - LATER

Chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of
people.  They surround a small building, a neighborhood
clinic.  A worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates
the structure.

         IN MEMORY OF NATALIE "ALICE" SHELDRAKE M.D.,
          CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE
             BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961

Next to the stone a funeral urn.  A YOUNG MINISTER gropes
for meaning.

                         MINISTER
          I didn't know Richard Sheldrake
          personally, but his many friends who
          knew and worked with him, wanted to
          make sure that he was returned home,
          here, to be remembered with his
          beloved wife...

Chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice
fading away.  The afternoon wind is coming up with the
tide.  He quietly heads towards the water.  Drifting,
drawn, lost.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Though he had moved on with his
          life, now even for the years, to
          hear him eulogized by strangers,
          seemed strange.  He had been a
          hewner of stones, a pilot by the
          silent stars.  Like me, alone among
          many.  But most of all for us, the
          crew of the brigantine Albatross, he
          was always and would forever be...
          our Skipper.

A SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  A
beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips
into port.  A picture out of another time, another place.
It takes him away...

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  FOREST - WATER TOWER - DAY

A towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and
sycamores.  The tower is immense.  A single ladder runs up
to the top.

AT THE TOP

Just above the tree tops, the view is spectacular.  CHUCK
GIEG, 16, sits thin and unsteady.  Chuck's gaze is drawn
upward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds.  Chuck's
older brother WILL, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself
to the top.

                         WILL
          You gonna jump?  Or are you just
          having a last look?

                         CHUCK
          I was just thinking that I never had
          a new pair of shoes till I was
          twelve.

                         WILL
          It's no my fault I was born first.
          Besides, nobody ever sent me on an
          eight month vacation, so ease up on
          the sad sack stuff.

                         CHUCK
          It's not a vacation, it's private
          school.

                         WILL
          I thought this was your dream come
          true.

                         CHUCK
          That's not why he's sending me.

                         WILL
          Why then.

                         CHUCK
          Because it looks good.

Chuck looks out, yearning.  Will considers him, troubled.

                         CHUCK
          I'm just not like you.  Ya know?
          I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm
          never going to be "William".

                         WILL
          Nobody says you have to be like me.

                         CHUCK
          He does.

                         WILL
          You don't give him enough credit
          Chas.

Chuck takes a last look at the building clouds.  The sky
rumbles.  Distant thunder.

                         WILL
          We better go.


EXT.  GIEG HOUSE - DAY

Maple street, USA, tree lined and quaint.  The Gieg home
is a modest two story house with a covered porch.  The
family station wagon is poised for departure.  CHARLES,
45, a generally serious man broods as MIDDY, their mother,
40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house.  Chuck and Will
appear from the woods.

                         CHARLES
                  (ticked)
          You plan on making this plane or
          not?

                         WILL
          Don't take any wooden nickels
          Kemosabe.

                         CHUCK
          I won't.

Will shoves out a hand at Chuck.

                         WILL
          And lighten up will ya.

Chuck hugs him anyway and walks to the passenger side.
Charles tosses him the keys, like he's doing him a big
favor.


INT.  CAR - DAY

Chuck sits in the drivers seat.  Middy is in the back.
Charles slams the trunk and gets in.  Before Chuck turns
the ignition...

                         CHARLES
          Now just take it easy.  We're not
          going to a fire.

Chuck reacts.

OUTSIDE

Will watches as the car pulls away.

CAR - MOVING

The Giegs drive in silence.  Middy reads from a brochure.

                         MIDDY
          Honey, did you know that the
          Albatross was captured by the
          Germans during World War II?

                         CHUCK
          No, I didn't.

                         MIDDY
          It says she was originally Schooner
          rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned
          her into a brigantine.  I think
          square rigs look so much more
          romantic.

                         CHUCK
          Me too.

                         CHARLES
          Appearances aren't everything.  Keep
          your mind on the road.

Chuck pulls over to the side of the road.

                         CHARLES
          What are you doing?

Chuck hands him the keys.

                         CHUCK
          I don't feel like driving.  Okay?

Charles regards him oddly.


EXT.  AIRPORT GATE - DAY

The National Airlines Boeing 707 is bigger than anything
Chuck has ever seen.  Passengers begin boarding.  Charles
stands away, detached.

                         MIDDY
          Do you have your ticket?

                         CHUCK
          Yes.

                         MIDDY
          Passport?

                         CHUCK
          Look, I just better go.

Middy hugs her son.

                         CHUCK
          Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.

                         MIDDY
          I know you will.

Chuck faces his dad.

                         CHARLES
          Make us proud.

                         CHUCK
          Yes sir.

Charles extends his hand.  They shake.  Then Chuck hurries
away into the crowd.  Charles and Middy watch until he is
out of sight.


INT.  PLANE - DAY

Chuck settles into his seat next to the window.  He
watches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the
707.


EXT.  AIRPORT CUSTOMS - BERMUDA - DAY

Another world.  Chuck stands in line at the customs booth.
He cranes his neck to see the brilliant blue water and
coral reefs beyond the runway.

Three other boys are ahead of him in line.  The CUSTOMS
AGENTS go through every piece of luggage.  TOD JOHNSTONE,
16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of
the agents about his spear gun.

RICK MARCH, 17, wise-cracking and confident, shakes his
head, smiling.  He spots Chuck, moves through the line and
shoves out a hand.

                         RICK
          Albatross?

                         CHUCK
          Yeah.

                         RICK
          Rick March.  Who the hell are you?

                         CHUCK
          Gieg, Chuck.

                         RICK
          Look, meet us out front when you're
          through.  If they try to take
          anything away from you like Johnny
          Quest up there, just make a list and
          we'll have 'em send it down to the
          boat.

                         CHUCK
          Whatever.

One of the agent starts pulling things out of Rick's
duffel bag.  He finds a dive knife.

                         RICK
          Hey, hey!!  That's my stuff!!


EXT.  AUSTIN CAB - MOVING - DAY

The car whizzes through the narrow streets of Bermuda.
CALYPSO MUSIC sings from the radio.  The streets are lined
with small coral houses and exotic palms.


INT.  CAR - SAME

The boys are jammed inside with their things.  In addition
to Chuck, Rick and Tod, is CHARLIE STRATTON, also sixteen.

                         TOD
          Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no,
          it's sweet to be back in the world
          of rum and honey.

                         RICK
          I gotta admit I never thought you'd
          be back after the great "Bowsprit
          Affair".

                         TOD
          Me and Skipper had a meeting of the
          minds.

                         CHARLIE
          How's that?

                         TOD
          I begged.

                         CHUCK
                  (warming a little)
          What the "Bowsprit Affair"?

                         RICK
          Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch
          and managed to sweet talk one of the
          local girls to have a go in the
          bowsprit.

                         TOD
          Not just any 'local' girl.

                         RICK
          The 'local' mayor's 'local'
          daughter.

Tod smiles, reminiscing.

                         CHARLIE
          Thing is, the net in the basket
          isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o
          wraps them up in the jib.  After the
          deed was done...

                         RICK
          He says they did the deed...

                         TOD
          Trust me, we did the deed.

                         CHARLIE
          After the "alleged" deed was done,
          they fell asleep.  Big Daddy Lawford
          comes on deck at four bells and
          hears Casanova sawing logs.

                         TOD
          Believe me, I needed the rest...

                         CHARLIE
          He gets the whole crew on deck, gets
          us on the halyard, and orders the
          old "heave ho...".

                         RICK
          Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o
          and the mayor's daughter, naked as
          pilot whales...

                         CHARLIE
                  (to Tod)
          I don't know who was more surprised,
          you or Big Daddy.

                         TOD
          To tell you the truth, I think it
          was her father.

At the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view.

                         RICK
          Well gentlemen, there she is.

The cab stops.  Besides many colorful fishing boats, is
the ALBATROSS.  At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything
in the harbor.  Her white hull glows like ivory and her
twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck.
Breathtaking.

                         CHARLIE
          Home sweet hell on the water.


EXT.  DOCK - DAY

The boys pile out of the taxi.  What seemed like a
pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up
close.  The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover
the hull.  Looks of disappointment.

                         CHUCK
          What happened to it?

A voice from behind turns Chuck.

                         BILL
          She cleans up.  We'll have her ship
          shape before we shove off.

This is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew
and... first mate.  Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on
the back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Viking
giant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's
English professor.

Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at
Tod and the others.  He speaks with the voice of Moses.

                         LAWFORD
          "That this same child of honor and
          renown, This gallant Hotspur, this
          all praised knight, And your
          unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
          For every honor sitting on his helm,
          Would they were multitudes, and on
          my head.  My shames redoubled!  For
          the time will come...

Chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the
intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins.
Their eyes lock.

                         LAWFORD
          ... That I shall make this northern
          youth exchange, his glorious deeds
          for my indignities."

Then, the man is gone.  Haunting.  Only Chuck has seen
him.  Tod smiles back at Lawford impishly.

                         TOD
          Would you be addressing me, sir?

                         LAWFORD
          I would.

                         RICK
          What's that supposed to mean?

                         LAWFORD
                  (beat)
          Henry the IV part I Act I Scene ii.
          I suggest you read it.

Lawford sneers and walks away.  It's all a show.

                         CHARLIE
          It means Shakespeare.  B-o-r-i-n-g.

                         BILL
          It means if he catches anybody
          basket-napping on watch this
          passage, he's gonna use their lizard
          for 'cuda' bait.

                         RICK
                  (lightly)
          Well that's a hell of a how-do-you-
          do.

                         BILL
          Drop your gear, go below and pick
          yourself some bunks.

Chuck and the others climb aboard.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY

Chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main
cabin.  Other crew members are already unpacking.

The sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of
bunks on each side of the cabin.  In the middle of the
room is a gimbaled table.  This is where the crew will eat
and study.

                         RICK
          Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg.

Among the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub
with soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and
rodent-like.

Robin approaches with a hand extended.  He carries a 8x10
photo of a young man in a football uniform.

                         ROBIN
          I'm Robin.

Chuck regards the photo.

                         ROBIN
                  (flat)
          That's my brother.  He's dead.

Apprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk.
Robin tacks up the picture above his bunk.  Terry unpacks
in front of one of the lower berths.

A loud "THUD!" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag lies
at the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposing
figure climbs into the cabin.

This is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad.
His hair is slicked back "Dean" style and wears a full
day's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to the
others, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path.
He stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk)
and drops his bag.

                         JOHN
          I'll take this one.

                         TERRY
          You probably didn't notice, but this
          bunk has been taken.

John just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things
onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it
into the remaining upper berth.  Terry watches,
intimidated.

                         JOHN
          Anybody gotta problem with that?

                         RICK
                  (beat)
          Absolutely not.

John climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes.  Bill
enters, followed by several adults.

DR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is
ship's surgeon and Skipper's wife.  Lawford appears with
GEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit.

                         BILL
          Alright, listen up.  This is Dr.
          Alice Sheldrake.

The guys stumble over only half listening.

                         ALICE
          I'm ship's surgeon.  I'm in charge
          of aches, pains, biology, math and
          science.

                         BILL
          George Pascal here is ship's cook.

                         GEORGE
          If you want to keep all your
          fingers, stay the hell out of my
          galley unless you're invited.

                         BILL
          Some of you already know Mr.
          Lawford.

                         LAWFORD
          I have been charged with the dubious
          task of insuring your literary
          education.

Lawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder.

                         LAWFORD
          Bill Butler is your first mate.  But
          don't let his size fool you.

Bill gives a half reluctant wave.

                         MIKE
          So when the hell do we get to meet
          El Capitan?

Snickering.

                         TERRY
                  (aside)
          Maybe he's getting his wooden leg
          waxed.

Laughter.  A sound stops the laughter.  Almost on cue, the
sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above
them.  Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking
the light.  Ominous.  They all notice and look up.

                         LAWFORD
                  (mysterious)
          You'll meet him.  Soon enough.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE

Dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin.  The
only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber.
Suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.

                         LAWFORD (O.S.)
          Arise, Arise, Arise...

Chuck wakes, disoriented.  Terry bolts upright and hits
his head on the low ceiling.  Ouch.

Tod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly.  Lawford's voice
echoes through the ship.

                         LAWFORD (O.S.)
          Exultation is the going/ Of an
          inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/
          Past the headlands/ Into deep
          Eternity/ Bred as we, among the
          mountains/ Can the sailor
          understand/ the divine intoxication/
          of the first league out from land?
                  (pause)
          But I suppose we'll answer that
          question soon enough gentlemen.
          Soon enough.

                         TERRY
          What question?

Chuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.  Robin swings
his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look.
John rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.

                         ROBIN
                  (foggy)
          What the hell is going on?

                         CHUCK
          Maybe it's an air raid.

In crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps
through the aft bulkhead.  He raises a bowswain's  whistle
and blows.  OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!  Chuck and Robin grab their
ears.  It's a nightmare.  Terry jumps and hits his head
again.

                         BILL
          Roll out sailors!  All hands on
          deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty
          seconds.

He blows the whistle again.  This time it brings even John
to his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.  Bill
looks up and casually notices him.

                         BILL
          You gotta problem Goodall?

                         JOHN
          You blow that thing again I'll shove
          it so far up your ass, you're gonna
          need dental floss to get it out.

                         BILL
          Just get on deck.

Bill turns and disappears topside.


EXT.  DECK - DAWN

The sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew
staggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering.

                         BILL
          Line up!  Single file.  Single file.

The crew lines up.  John is the last one through the hatch
and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed.

                         BILL
          Everybody swims.

The boys are aghast.

                         LAWFORD
          Don't think people, just go!  Go,
          Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win,
          stay you pay!!

Rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by
Tod and Charlie.  They howl and scream as they hit the
water.  The rest follow like lemmings.  But John stands
defiantly with his arms folded.

                         BILL
          Now what's the problem, Goodall?
          Everybody swims.

The crew are piling back on deck.  George stands in the
open galley door.  The smell of fresh bacon is
intoxicating.

                         JOHN
          I don't.

                         LAWFORD
          You will if you wanna eat.  Right
          George?

George nods, wielding a butchers knife.  The crew stand
shivering, waiting on John.

                         JOHN
                  (to Bill)
          You gonna swim for your breakfast?

Bill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts,
swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard
arm.  He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet
below.  It's a long way.  Robin turns away.

Lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.

                         LAWFORD
          "Down, down beneath the deep, That
          oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a
          sound and peaceful sleep, With the
          salt waves dashing over him." --
          Lord Byron gentlemen.

With that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge
KERSPLASH!  He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself
up and gets in John's face.

                         BILL
          Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in
          twice.  So I guess I'll be eating
          your breakfast too.

John considers him, then strips off his shirt.  But
instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into
the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down.

He manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of
ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard
arm -- the topgallant.  It's a pissing contest and
everybody knows it.

                         MIKE
          I got five bucks says he doesn't.

                         CHRIS
          I got five that says he doesn't
          live.

                         TOD
          I'll take a dollar of that.

                         ROBIN
          This is crazy!

Robin refuses to watch.  The others share a look.

John makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the
end of the yard.  He tosses a look towards Bill but with
no way to back down, he launches into the air.  Everyone
gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive.
Falling, falling, falling...

                         CHUCK
          Jesus.

                         ROBIN
          I can't watch this.

John hits the water like a bullet.  The crew run to the
side waiting for him to come up.  Nothing.  Finally, he
breaks the surface.  Easy.  He climbs up waiting, somehow,
to claim victory.

Suddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appeared
silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing
down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to
see him.

RICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept,
casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and
glides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzed
from the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of command
like a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be
reckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence of
someone larger than life.

                         BILL
          Skipper on deck!

The crew line up clumsily.  Skipper has a gaze that blazes
right through them.

He looks out to sea.  Searching, ominous.  He waits until
the silence is filled with everyone's attention.

                         SKIPPER
          You know what's out there?  Wind and
          wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools
          that'll hold a sailing ship for
          weeks and then spit her out into the
          eye of the kind of hurricane.  A
          blow that could knock the bridge off
          a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and
          sandbars that'll tear the belly from
          her and enough fog and night to hide
          it all.

He spits into the water.  The crew sheepishly throw
glances to the horizon.

                         SKIPPER
          So look out there... and explain to
          me why any man in possession of any
          sense at all, would take on the sea
          with sail?

Skipper turns his gaze back to the boys.  There is a fire
in his eyes.  Nobody dare answers.

                         SKIPPER
          Because there's something else out
          there.  It beckons in the wind and
          sings in the shrouds.  Voices.
          Whispering...

His ear to the wind.

                         SKIPPER
          They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men
          you don't even know.  Men you can't
          even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish,
          that part of you and I that aches to
          be alive, that was banished by
          everything we've ever been taught or
          told.  It's a part of us that can
          only be found on mountain tops and
          deserts, in the deepest caverns,
          smoking battle fields and... across
          oceans.

He turns back to the sea, dark.

                         SKIPPER
          Out there, is where it all waits.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          He was everything I had expected,
          part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh.
          He spoke in whispers and answered
          all queries with efficiency and
          directness.  He had gone to sea for
          the first time at fifteen, the same
          age as Bill Butler.  And as he
          looked upon us that first day it
          must have been as though he were
          staring into a mirror.

Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the
chart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded to
the main mast and reads the inscription.

                         SKIPPER
                  (reading)
          "Where we go one, we go all."

With that, he disappears below.  Nobody moves.  This is
exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits
the fan.

                         TERRY
          This -- is gonna be a long eight
          months.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY

The boys devour a hearty breakfast.  Tod is the 'galley
slave' and fills glasses with orange juice.

                         TOD
          Chow down boys.  The milk and eggs
          are the first things to go once we
          put out.

John enters balancing two plates heaped with food.

                         RICK
          You know we gotta dumbwaiter for
          that.

John looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall.

                         RICK
          Not that one.  Tod-o here.

The guys groan.

                         TOD
          Har, har, har...

John approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry who
doesn't notice him.  Finally he looks up, startled.

                         TERRY
          I'm done.  I'm finished...

He scrambles to get up and clear his plate.  John sits
down without a word.  The others notice the two plates of
food.

                         RICK
          Hungry, Goodall?

He just grunts and starts eating.  Robin watches him.

                         JOHN
          What's your problem?

                         ROBIN
          Why'd you jump?

                         JOHN
          Because I felt like it.
                  (sharp)
          What do you care?

                         ROBIN
                  (aside)
          I couldn't do it.

                         JOHN
          Well, as soon as you grow some
          balls, let me know.

Robin bristles.

                         ROBIN
          Screw you!

                         CHARLIE
          He's right.  It was a stupid stunt.

                         JOHN
          Excuse me?

                         CHARLIE
          You heard me.

John grabs Charlie by his private parts and hoists him
into the air.  Charlie gasps, the air sucked from his
lungs.

                         JOHN
          Don't ever call me stupid.

                         ROBIN
          Come on, he didn't mean anything.

John shoves Robin to the floor with his free arm.

                         JOHN
          Let me tell you girls something.  I
          do what I wanna do.  When I wanna do
          it.  And I don't give a shit what
          old Ahab up there thinks either.
          Any questions?

John releases Charlie who crumples to the floor.  John
resumes eating.

Bill enters and reads the duty roster.

                         BILL
          Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg,
          Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart:
          scrape and paint.  Corry and
          Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson,
          you're the Galley slave.  March
          you're on chain gang with Barnes.
          Johnston, solo on bilge detail.

                         TOD
          Butler, what'd I ever do to you?

                         BILL
          You came back, Tod.  You came back.

John continues to eat.  When he realizes his name hasn't
been called, he looks up to meet Bill's eyes.


INT.  HEAD

Pissed, John tries to figure out the head.  Pumps going
in, pumps going out.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          We were all thirteen individuals.
          We'd arrived the sum total of our
          limited experiences and the result
          of our parents' best, if not narrow,
          expectations...

John pulls back on the lever, belching "water de le
toilet" all over him.


EXT.  SHIP - DAY

Chuck sits in a bowswain's chair over the side, with a
paint roller in his hand.  The rust-streaked hull is being
transformed.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          ... Some of us were there for
          discipline, some for escape.  But I
          could see a small piece of myself in
          all of them and though I fought the
          notion, for me, I knew now, this
          would be home.

A RADIO crackles in the b.g.

                         ANNOUNCER
          "President Eisenhower today
          acknowledged that a secret American
          spy plane was in fact shot down over
          the Soviet Union.  The pilot has
          been confirmed as Francis Gary
          Powers..."

Robin, Terry and Mike, are on the deck within earshot of
Chuck with chisels and wire brushes chipping away at the
rust.

                         TERRY
          Why couldn't it have been a wooden
          boat?

                         MIKE
          Steel boats don't leak.

Mike lights up a cigarette.  Robin notices.  Marlboro's.

                         ROBIN
          Hey, can I have one?

Mike sizes up Robin for a moment then tosses him the pack.

                         ROBIN
          Thanks daddy-o.

Robin lights up, grimacing with the first drag.

                         TERRY
          Well, don't brush too hard.  Looks
          to me like the only thing holding
          this bucket together is the rust.

A voice booms up from the dock.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Ahoy there.

They turn.  Standing on the dock is FRANCIS BOUTILLIER,
self important and overbearing, with his son, PHILIP, who
looks as if this whole ordeal is some kind of punishment.
Skipper appears.

                         SKIPPER
          Good afternoon.

Francis boards without being invited.  Philip follows in
his shadow.  He scrutinizes the condition of the boat.

                         FRANCIS
          Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of
          confidence.

                         SKIPPER
          Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross
          is considered a very good omen.  It
          is said they embody the spirits of
          sailors passed on.  It's very bad
          luck if you kill one.  And dolphins
          too.

The boys chuckle.

                         FRANCIS
          I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my
          son, Philip.

                         SKIPPER
          I know.

Francis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling.

                         SKIPPER
          You're a day late.  We keep a
          schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend
          on it.
                  (to Philip)
          Hello, Philip.

                         PHIL
          Sir.

Skipper's directness bugs Francis.

                         FRANCIS
          Your cable said you wouldn't be
          putting out until mid-October.

                         SKIPPER
          As you can see, there's a lot to do.

                         FRANCIS
          Indentured servitude is not what my
          son had in mind.

                         SKIPPER
          This is a working ship.  Promptness
          is not a luxury, it's a necessity,
          as is the work to maintain her.  Had
          we been ready, I can assure you we
          would have sailed.

Something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation.

                         FRANCIS
          And I would have expected
          compensation for my time and expense
          coming all the way down here.

                         SKIPPER
          Happily, it all worked out... This
          time.
                  (to Bill)
          Bill, take Philip below and help him
          find a bunk.

Phil follows Bill down the companionway.

                         FRANCIS
          I'll be frank with you.  This was
          his mother's idea.  A romp through
          the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds
          more like a vacation than an
          education if you ask me.

                         SKIPPER
          It will be more than that, I can
          promise you.

                         FRANCIS
                  (cool)
          Take good care of my son.

There is threat in his tone.

                         SKIPPER
          We'll do our best.  You're welcome
          to say goodbye.

                         FRANCIS
          He's a big boy.

Francis leaves the boat.  Skipper and the crew watch as he
climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off.

                         LAWFORD
          Well, that was neighborly.

                         SKIPPER
          He didn't get to be Under Secretary
          of the Air Force by being
          neighborly.

Lawford shakes his head.  Bill comes up through the
companionway.

                         SKIPPER
          Everyone aboard young Bill?

                         BILL
          Yes, Sir.

                         SKIPPER
          Good.
                  (beat)
          Let's go sailing.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - OPEN WATER - DAY

The Albatross is under full power.  There is a sense of
excitement and anticipation.  Charlie, Rick, Robin, and
Lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail.  Skipper is
at the helm with Alice and Bill nearby.  Skipper calls
over to Chuck who stands alone at the rail.

                         SKIPPER
          Come over here and take the wheel.

Chuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the
wheel.

                         SKIPPER
          Hold her steady into the wind.
          Southwest by west.

                         CHUCK
          Yes sir.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to all)
          Gentleman, when you hear an order,
          sing out.  I want to know that
          you've heard and understand.
                  (quietly to Bill)
          Raise the mainsail.

                         BILL
                  (calling out)
          Raise the main!

Lawford and his group bellow out.

                         TOGETHER
          Raise the main!!

Lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the
chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy
furled canvas to the main boom.  He guides another to the
midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the
huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens the
halyard and hands it to Robin.

                         SKIPPER
          Take a turn under the pin and lead
          it out to the others.  You guys in
          the rear take up the slack.  Heave
          together now...

In a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea
chanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt.

                         BILL
                  (singing)
          "When the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup..."

The more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the
beat.

                         BOYS
          "When the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup..."

                         LAWFORD
          Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt
          it out like men!!

The newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look at
each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever
heard of.

                         BILL
                  (singing)
          "Not one of us was a sober..."

The boys return the verse half heartedly.  Lawford ties
off his line and stares them down.  Skipper notices that
the work has stopped.

                         SKIPPER
          What's wrong Mr. Lawford.

                         LAWFORD
          It seems we're short on singers.

Skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.

                         SKIPPER
          Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer
          gentlemen.  It lets everyone know
          you're in sync.  It shows unity,
          that all thoughts are one.  A crew
          that sings together stays together.
          Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and
          be sailors.

                         JOHN
                  (in a whisper)
          Everybody swims, everybody sings...
          What's next?  Tap dancing?

Lawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down
with their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  The
crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great
mainsail starts to rise.

                         LAWFORD
          Tie it off!!

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Bill)
          Outer.

                         BILL
          Outer Jib!

                         CHARLIE
                  (confused)
          Outta what?

Coached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist
the jib.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Bill)
          We'll bear off to port and run down
          wind.

                         BILL
          Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the
          mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib
          sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim
          and Dick go aloft to unstop the
          forecourse.  George will show you
          what to do.  Tod, show your men the
          forward pinrail and stand ready on
          the buntlines and clewlines.
          Forecourse first... work upward.

The newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George,
John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto
the footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusion
everywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing.

Lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the
others move into their positions.  When Bill sees the
yardarm crew is in place...

                         BILL
          Unstop the squares!

                         YARDARM CREW
          Unstop the squares!!

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Chuck)
          Fall off to port.  Ease her around
          to a heading of northeast.  Sing out
          when you're there.

As the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into
a scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind the
snapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, the
ship heels and surges forward.

Before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance
and grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out the
mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines
releasing the stops on the other squaresails.

                         CHUCK
                  (in a whisper)
          Ah... Northeast... sir.

                         SKIPPER
                  (barking)
          Speak up boy!

Chuck jumps, startled.  He self-consciously calls out.

                         CHUCK
          Northeast sir!

                         SKIPPER
          Unfurl the squares!

Tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and
the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending
a shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles with
the added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice and
Lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's
position.

Chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty
of the canvas that the Albatross carries.

                         BILL
          Raise the inner jib!  Raise the
          forestaysail!

                         SKIPPER
          Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we
          jibe now we'll have a lot of people
          in the water.

                         CHUCK
          Yes, sir.

                         SKIPPER
          All stop on the engine.

                         BILL
          All stop on the engine!

Bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves
it to the stop position.

                         SKIPPER
          Behold gentlemen.  The power of the
          wind!

As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed.
Everyone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a
powerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam
splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through
the water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a
magical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer.

                         SKIPPER
          Did we lose anybody?

                         ALICE
          Not yet.

LONG SHOT

The Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful
image of another time.  And yet, here she is.

ON DECK

Each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment.
Music builds.

                         SKIPPER
          Chart us a course for the windward
          side.

Alice considers his request.

                         ALICE
          That low passed through last night.
          May be a little bumpy out there.

                         SKIPPER
          It's time these boys saw some real
          blue water.


EXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER

The bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a
fifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is
fierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and
sailing well.

The crew has never seen mountains of water like this.
Disaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front
of the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear
life.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands
effortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains
perfectly dry.

                         SKIPPER
          Well... now that I have your
          undivided attention... I'd like to
          take this opportunity to make a few
          points...

                         TERRY
                  (aside)
          This guy is certifiable...

                         PHIL
          Suicidal...

                         SKIPPER
          The first thing is I don't like
          people talking when I'm talking so
          the two of you, shut up.

Caught, Terry and Phil button up.

                         SKIPPER
          Second, the next one of you who
          doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr.
          Butler gives an order is gonna spend
          the rest of this trip scrubbing
          bilges.  He's a better sailor today
          than any ten of you will be when
          this is all over.

Skipper directs the next comment directly at John.

                         SKIPPER
          And if I catch anybody, ever,
          jumping off a yard arm again I will
          personally break what bones are left
          and send you home in a wheel chair.

A wave explodes over the bow.  A wall of water crashes
over the deck knocking down several of the boys.  Terry
can't take it anymore and explodes.

                         TERRY
          We're gonna die!!!  We're all gonna
          die!

He lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him.

                         SKIPPER
          Excellent point.  As you might have
          noticed, being out here pretty much
          puts you in the moment.  If you
          panic, if you lose your head, you
          die.  Maybe you take your mates with
          you.  How'd you like to have to bet
          on Terry here getting us home today?
          Each one of you is responsible for
          the rest.  "Where we go one, we go
          all".  If your buddy is asleep at
          the switch we're all fish food.

He's making his point which is lost on no one.

                         SKIPPER
          The ship beneath you is not a toy
          and sailing is not a game.  The
          Albatross will take us far
          gentlemen, but she demands constant
          attention.  Respect her, and we'll
          do fine.  Oh, and one more thing.
          There is nothing that goes on, on
          this boat that I don't know about.
          She speaks to me in the night.  So
          don't test me.  Not even a little.

Skipper walks over and puts an arm around Terry who is
fighting sobs.

                         SKIPPER
          Nothing like experience to put
          things in perspective.  Huh son?
                  (to Bill)
          Alright.  Let's go home.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - DAY

Lawford addresses some of the crew.  Chuck, Robin and John
are among them.  John glares at Lawford.  The guys giggle.

                         LAWFORD
          That's not a satisfactory answer.

                         JOHN
          Look, save it for somebody else will
          ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have
          anything to do with me.

Lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes
theatrically.

                         LAWFORD
          Shit?!!!

He slams a text book into John's hands.

                         LAWFORD
          Read for me please the words of Mr.
          Keats at the bottom of the page.

John stares back, simmering.  Robin interrupts the
potential confrontation and reaches for the book.

                         ROBIN
          I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.

                         JOHN
          Shut up donut.

John pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for a
moment.  He begins reading but struggles with the cadence.

                         JOHN
                  (reading)
          Much have I traveled in realms of
          gold/ And many goodly states and
          kingdoms seen/ Round many western
          islands have I been/ Which bards in
          fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one
          wide expanse had I been told/ That
          deep-browed Homer ruled as his
          demesne.

                         LAWFORD
          You know what he is talking about
          here?

Blank faces.

                         LAWFORD
                  (ranting)
          Awe.  Humility.  He's telling you
          that he has traveled the seas as
          Homer did.  As Ulysses had before
          him as he tried to find his way home
          to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars.
          "That deep browed Homer"...

He points to his head.

                         LAWFORD
          Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the
          mind; "... ruled as his demesne."
          He commands the voyage of the
          imagination, like a god.
                  (pause)
          That is what one of the greatest
          literary minds of modern times, Mr.
          Boutillier, has to say about Homer.

He snatches the book back.

                         LAWFORD
          You think the Odyssey is dull?  I'll
          tell you something, it's about each
          one of you -- right now.  Doubt and
          expectation.  Friendship, community,
          self sacrifice and accountability.

He holds up the text.

                         LAWFORD
          This isn't just a story!!  It's
          history made allegory.  It is a
          philosophical handbook for life!  It
          holds the secret of this very
          voyage.

                         JOHN
          What is it... the secret?

Lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh.

                         JOHN
                  (confused)
          What?

                         LAWFORD
          If it were only that simple, my
          young friend.  Read on, gentlemen.
          Read on.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Aerial shot.  The Albatross is under full sail leaving
Bermuda for the last time.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          And so it was the Albatross that
          took to the open sea with the wind
          in her snapping canvas and a bone of
          white foam in her teeth... In each
          of us were feelings of anticipation
          and hesitation for the man at the
          wheel and of the unfamiliar world he
          was leading us into.

She crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music,
building.

DECK - DAY

The crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail.  Chuck
struggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in.

ALOFT

The crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the
rigging.

BOWSPRIT NET

The crew pull down the jib trying to furl it.  Most of the
sail ends up dragging in the water.

ABOVE

The squaresails are dropped simultaneously.

WIDE

White foam boils from the bow of the Albatross as she
crashes through the waves.

AT THE WHEEL

Alice smiles and puts her arms around Skipper's waist.
It's coming together.

FORETOP - SAME

Skipper stands at the rail, looking out.  The seas are up
and the masts are pitching widely from side to side.

Chuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestling
with one of the squaresails.  The pitching mast catches
him by surprise and he slips.  He tumbles down, tangled in
the lines.  A rope wraps around his neck, choking him.
Robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly.

                         ROBIN
          Bill!!  Skipper!!

Robin freezes.  Skipper leaps into the rigging like a
spider and, in a few seconds, wrestles Chuck free and
carries him down to the deck.  Chuck coughs, catching his
breath.  The color is gone from Skipper's face.  This was
a close call.

                         SKIPPER
          You all right?

                         CHUCK
          It was my fault.  I slipped.

Alice examines Chuck, making sure he's okay.  Skipper
turns to Robin, who is shaken.  He never raises his voice.

                         SKIPPER
          Why didn't you go up there?

Robin stands silently.

                         SKIPPER
          Speak up.

Still nothing from Robin.

                         CHARLIE
          He's afraid to climb.

                         SKIPPER
          What?
                  (to Robin)
          Is that true?

Robin looks away.

                         SKIPPER
          Why wasn't I made aware of this
          Bill?

                         BILL
          I didn't know sir.

                         SKIPPER
          It's your job to know.  If something
          goes wrong up there, the other
          eighteen people aboard can't be
          wondering if he's gonna do his job
          or not.

Skipper returns his gaze to Robin, measuring him.
Finally.

                         SKIPPER
          Swing up, son.

                         ROBIN
                  (trembling)
          What?

                         SKIPPER
          Up you go.  Right now.

Robin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung,
then the second.  He stops and steals a peek up.  The mast
is swaying.  He freezes, his lip starts to tremble.  All
eyes are on him.  Phil chuckles.

                         SKIPPER
          Do you have something to say?

                         PHIL
                  (smug)
          No.

                         SKIPPER
          Then keep your mouth shut.

Phil backs off, stunned.  Robin can't move.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Robin)
          What's it going to be?

                         ROBIN
          I'm sorry...

                         SKIPPER
          Sorry won't cut it.

Robin holds on frozen.  Skipper turns to the crew.

                         SKIPPER
          Survival means discipline and
          assimilation.  There are no special
          cases here.
                  (to Robin)
          Now, get going.  Get up there.

Humiliated, a tear slips down his face.  Excruciating.

                         SKIPPER
          What are you blubbering about?

                         ROBIN
          I don't know...

Skipper jumps onto the backside of the ratlines.  His face
is but inches from Robin's.

                         SKIPPER
          One hand in front of the other son.
          We'll do it together.

Robin reaches for the next rung.  He looks down.  Skipper
growls at him.

                         SKIPPER
          Don't look down.  Look in my eyes!
          Climb!  We'll do it together.

                         ROBIN
                  (sobbing)
          I can't.

                         SKIPPER
          You climb damn it, or so help me
          I'll haul you to the foretop by your
          diaper and leave you there!

                         ROBIN
          Aaauuuhhh!!!

Skipper gets right in his face and snarls.

                         SKIPPER
          Are you hating this?!  Are you!

                         ROBIN
          I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!

                         SKIPPER
          No.  Hate the fear inside of you!
          Climb like a man mister!  Hate it!
          Hate it away.  Hate your way up one
          more rung!!  Do it right now!!

With every ounce of strength, Robin reaches for one more
rung screaming as he reaches.  Skipper climbs and screams
with him.

                         TOGETHER
          Auuuggghhh!!!!

Robin clutches the rung with a death grip.  Then, he looks
down.  His bladder releases.  Hot urine runs down his legs
and splashes, steaming, onto the deck.  The crew is
horrified.  Robin weeps.

                         ROBIN
          Oh, god...

Skipper backs off.

                         SKIPPER
          Don't hate yourself.  Hate your
          weakness.  All right.  Get down.

Robin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others,
mortified.

                         SKIPPER
          I'm only gonna say this one time.
          I'm not here to wipe noses and
          asses.  I'm not your mother.  Trust
          funds and blue blazers don't get you
          a thing out here.  You wanna act
          like babies, then get off my boat.

Stunned, the crew is speechless.  Chuck instinctively goes
to help Robin.  Skipper snaps like a turtle.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Chuck)
          He can take care of himself.
                  (to others)
          Any other 'phobias' I need to know
          about?

Skipper fires a look towards Phil.

                         PHIL
          No, sir.

                         SKIPPER
          Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers
          a position to suit his condition.

Skipper turns and then stops.

                         SKIPPER
          Remember something, sooner or
          later... we all have to face it.

                         CHUCK
                  (aside)
          Face what?

The question hangs in the air like a cloud.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - DUSK

The chart house is the communication and navigation center
for the boat.  It also serves as the officers dining room.
Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sit
around the small table sipping coffee.

                         SKIPPER
          We're awfully quiet tonight.

The group remains silent.  Lawford and George exchange a
glance.  Skipper catches it.

                         SKIPPER
          Something on your mind, George?

George looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin.

                         GEORGE
          I think you were too hard on
          Weathers.

                         SKIPPER
          You do?

                         GEORGE
          Yes.  I do.

Skipper nods.

                         SKIPPER
          I need to know what I'm working
          with; what their boundaries are.
          Their lives depend on it, and for
          that matter so does yours.  We've
          got to bring them together.  Make
          them a crew.  We're as strong as our
          weakest link and I don't want to
          find that out the hard way.  So, I
          will challenge them and they will
          come together.

                         GEORGE
                  (sarcastic)
          Yes sir.

                         SKIPPER
          You know the best thing about being
          a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's
          all my responsibility.  So I'll tell
          you what George, you stay off of my
          bridge, and I'll stay out of your
          galley.  We'll get along that way.

Everyone's quiet, but clear.  Skipper and Alice exit.

                         GEORGE
          Fucking bastard.

Lawford lets out a belly laugh.

                         LAWFORD
          I've seen him snatch the tail of the
          tempest and stuff it, screaming,
          into a bottle.  The bilges are full
          of them.

                         GEORGE
          What do you mean?

                         LAWFORD
          He's been beyond the reach.  To the
          edge of the abyss and back.  He'll
          do well by us all George.  He's a
          real salt.  There's no malice in him
          and there's nothing more dear to him
          than his boys.  So sleep well my
          friend.

Lawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars,
passes one to George and winks.


INT.  GALLEY - DUSK

Robin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching
through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the
horizon.  Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of
food.

                         CHUCK
          How ya doing?

                         ROBIN
                  (without turning)
          Fine.

                         CHUCK
          Good.

                         ROBIN
          Look, I appreciate, you know, the
          concern and all, but like he said, I
          can take care of myself.

                         CHUCK
          I just brought you something to eat.

Robin turns and notices the plate of food and nods.  They
stand silently.  It's awkward.

                         CHUCK
          I feel like I got you into this.

                         ROBIN
          Forget it.

                         CHUCK
          I'm used to spending a lot of time
          alone.  I guess that's what I
          thought it would be out here.  But,
          it's not is it?

                         ROBIN
                  (beat)
          I'm sorry I left you hanging up
          there.

                         CHUCK
          It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm
          just sorry you got chewed out.

Robin nods.  They both stare out at the rising moon.

                         ROBIN
          My brother and I used to climb to
          the top of this old beech tree in
          the back yard and watch the moon
          come up just like this.  My parents
          would fight all the time so we'd
          sneak out there where we couldn't
          hear 'em and recite scenes from our
          favorite movies.

Robin grows quiet.

                         ROBIN
          Would you believe I miss it?  The
          middle of paradise and I'm homesick.

Chuck smiles and puts a hand on his back.

                         CHUCK
                  (ironic)
          Well, I wouldn't worry.  It'll all
          be there when we get back.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls
and pitches.  Chuck sees Terry heaving over the side.
John and Tod hear the sound and turn.

                         JOHN
                  (disgusted)
          Come on man.  Show a little
          backbone!
                  (to Tod)
          You believe that?!

Tod is fixated on Terry.  Suddenly, without warning, he
breaks for the rail and lets fly.

Phil and Charlie are next.  Chris climbs through the
companionway but doesn't make it to the side.  Spontaneous
regurgitation.  Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheel
housing to avoid being sprayed.  Suddenly everyone is
heaving.

                         CHRIS
          Sorry.

                         LAWFORD
                  (to Bill)
          We're gonna have nobody left up here
          to crew.  Better let Skipper know.

Bill nods and disappears.  John joins Chuck watching the
events around him.

                         JOHN
          Well Gieg, I'm glad to see I'm not
          the only guy on this boat that can
          take a little rock'n roll.  Bunch of
          wusses, I swear...!

Chuck watches each of his shipmates.  Then, suddenly, out
of nowhere -- Projectile vomit all over John.  He looks at
Chuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail.

                         JOHN
          Son of a bitch!!

Chuck looks at John, furious with himself, and begins to
laugh.  But after a moment he starts to laugh too.  It's
infectious, they crack each other up.  Then, in the middle
of belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over
the side.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY

Skipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in
front of him.  There's a knock on the door.

                         SKIPPER
          Come in.

                         BILL
          Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much
          doing group boot over the side.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, that's all part of it.

                         BILL
          We've got weather moving in from the
          west.

Skipper looks up.

                         SKIPPER
          That's part of it, too.


EXT.  DECK - DUSK

Skipper stands at the wheelhouse with Lawford, George and
Bill, studying the horizon through binoculars.  Dark
clouds.  Chuck watches Skipper.  Everyone, looking for a
cue.

                         CHUCK
          That a... storm, Skipper?

Skipper stays glued to the binoculars.

                         SKIPPER
          Uh, huh.

                         CHUCK
          Would you, um, say it's a big storm?

                         SKIPPER
          Sometimes it gets exciting out here.

                         LAWFORD
          What do you think?

                         SKIPPER
          Barometer's dropping.  The first
          blow'll come from the south.  Might
          get interesting.

                         CHUCK
          Shouldn't we turn away?

                         SKIPPER
          You can't run from the wind son.
          You trim your sails, face the music
          and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's
          close her up, dog, tight.

Close on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched
tight.

BELOW DECKS

Bulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly.

IN THE GALLEY

Pots and pans crash around.

IN THE MAIN CABIN

The cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books
on top of Alice.  She turns and looks at the mess,
annoyed.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

                         SKIPPER
          Furl the squares, reef the main, and
          bend on the storm jib, but keep it
          furled.  Drop everything but the
          inner jib.  I want everybody down
          before we get any lightning.

Bill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders.  Most of
the crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging and
begin dropping sail.

                         GEORGE
          Why's it always happen at night?

Skipper regards George, annoyed.

                         SKIPPER
          George... I want hot food in
          everybody.  Get to it.

George returns to the galley.  Alice joins Skipper at the
wheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear.

                         ALICE
          Looks like weather.

                         SKIPPER
          Yep.

He slips on a yellow slicker.

                         SKIPPER
          Do me a favor and tell Bill once
          she's dogged down I want everyone to
          break out their slickers and make
          sure their gear is stowed or we'll
          spend the next week sorting
          underwear.
                  (to the others)
          Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil
          will stand the watch.  Everyone else
          hit the racks.

                         PHIL
                  (impulsively)
          I'm not staying out here.

Skipper fires off a look that frightens even Phil.

                         SKIPPER
          No.  That's for sure.  Charlie, take
          his place.

Phil goes below, a little ashamed.  The crew scatters.
Chuck, still at the wheel, pipes up.

                         CHUCK
          If it's all the same, I'd like to
          stay on deck.

Skipper regards Chuck, who looks back with both fear and
eagerness.  Suddenly he sees something in this kid.  Maybe
himself.  He almost smiles.  Almost.

                         SKIPPER
          Take the wheel.


EXT.  FORETOP - SAME

Dark clouds blot out the sky and stars.  Thunder rumbles
far away.  The seas have built but there's no wind... yet.
With no steerage, the ship is tossed.

Tod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl.
The mast swings from side to side, but the air has gone
dead calm.  Skipper looks up, anticipating.

                         SKIPPER
          Everyone out of the rigging NOW!

                         BILL
          Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!

                         TOD
                  (shouting)
          HERE IT COMES!!

ON THE DECK

The crew in the rigging scamper down to the safety of the
deck.

                         SKIPPER
          Bill, on the wheel with Chuck.

Bill joins Chuck and takes hold of the wheel.  Then it
hits.

A wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of
thunder and flashing lightning.  The bow explodes through
twelve foot swells.  This is what the Albatross was born
to do.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

It's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks.  Pots
crash, books and personals go flying.  The guys are
scared.

ON DECK

The main and jib sheets tighten.  Skipper looks at Chuck
and Bill.  It all comes down to moments like these and he
loves it.

Suddenly, there is a loud CRACK!  A violent flapping
noise.  Skipper leaps to the port and looks forward.  Tod
comes running back.

                         TOD
          We blew the inner!

                         ALICE
          I'll go.

                         SKIPPER
          Bring it down and run up the storm
          jib.  We'll fix it later.  Stay out
          of reach of the blocks!

Tod and Alice disappear.

                         SKIPPER
                  (with a twinkle)
          Well, we're in it now.

Chuck studies him, frightened, but reassured.


EXT.  BOW - SAME

The shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind.
The block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it.  No
one dares go near it.  For a moment, it seems to hang
there seductively.  John, naive of its power, leaps for
the rail and grabs it.

                         ALICE
          NOOO!!!

Suddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John
high off the deck and over the side.  He holds on for dear
life, screaming.

AT THE WHEEL

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Chuck)
          Hold her steady.

Skipper bolts forward.

AT THE BOW

Alice uncleats the jib halyard, leaving one turn on the
pin and shoves it into Tod's hands.

                         ALICE
          Release this when I tell you!!

Skipper joins Tod as Alice scrambles along the deck and
pulls herself into the bowsprit netting.  When the block
and jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail
yelling...

                         ALICE
          NOW!!!

As John is snapped inboard Alice leaps up, grabbing the
sail, leaning out over the open water.  Waves explode
through the netting.  As Tod releases the halyard, John
falls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive.  Lawford
and Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit.

Skipper looks her over.  Relieved.  No broken bones.  Good
work.  But then this is what he expects.  He respects her
and now, everyone can see why.  He looks at John sprawled
on the deck.

                         SKIPPER
          Be careful will ya?

                         JOHN
          What ever you say Cap...

                         SKIPPER
          Let's get that storm jib up.

Skipper gives Alice a private look, then returns to the
stern where Chuck holds tightly onto the wheel.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          The storm lasted sixteen hours and
          it set us all on equal footing.  It
          was the first time that we shared an
          episode on an even plane.  As we
          stood our watches we were equally
          out of control of our situation,
          regardless of our physical abilities
          or social backgrounds.  And though
          our real feelings lay hidden beneath
          bravado and defiance, we were no
          longer strangers.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The crew is cleaning up.  Alice supervises repairs to the
jib while others stow line, scrub the deck and chip paint.
Lawford paces.

                         LAWFORD
          You know what they say in the Navy
          don't you?

                         RICK
          What's that, Big Daddy?

The more experienced crew members have heard this all
before.

                         LAWFORD
          "If it moves, salute it.  If it
          doesn't move, pick it up.  If it's
          too big to pick up, paint it!"

The boys mockingly salute Lawford as he walks by.  John
stands before a porthole combing his Brylcreem hair into a
"D.A."

Mike and Chris climb on deck with several large boxes.

                         MIKE
          Ladies, gentlemen and
          hermaphrodites, Mr. Corry and I are
          happy to announce the grand opening
          of Trans-Border Enterprises.

They start opening the boxes.  One is a case of Coca Cola,
another is full of cigarettes and candy.

                         CHRIS
          All of the creature comforts and
          vices you could possibly want, at
          home or abroad, available twenty-
          four hours a day.

                         MIKE
          For a price, of course.

                         ROBIN
          If you've got "a broad" available
          I'll take her.

                         JOHN
          Like you'd know what to do with one.

The crew shakes their heads, mutter and check out the
goods.

                         TERRY
          You got Marlboro's?

                         CHRIS
          Absa-fuckin-lutely.

                         CHUCK
          Toss me a Cola.

                         CHRIS
          Fifty cents.

                         CHUCK
          What?!!

                         MIKE
          Contraband's hard to come by out
          here son.

John is still grooming at the window.

                         PHIL
          Hey Goodall, you got a date or
          something?

John continues to comb.

                         JOHN
          Yeah.  With your mom.

                         EVERYBODY
          Oooooooo.

Phil slinks away.

                         CHRIS
          We also have a few rental items...

Chris displays a Playboy magazine.  Everybody clamors to
get a look.

                         MIKE
          There's a penalty for any material
          returned to the Trans-Border Library
          with sticky pages.

John walks by, snatches the magazine and heads for his
bunk flipping through the pages.

                         MIKE
          Hey, you can't do that!!
                  (to Chris)
          He can't do that!!

John flops in a deck chair.  Chris shakes his head and
starts closing up the boxes.

                         CHRIS
          Sure he can.


EXT.  STERN - LATER

Chuck sits alone, away from the others, reading.  On cue,
half of the crew descend, dragging him kicking and
screaming into the bowswain's chair, and over the side.
The guys cheer.

                         CHUCK
          Come on you guys, this isn't funny!

The seat spins, twists and swings from behind the boat.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on Chucky.  Show us a little
          grit.

They lower the chair so it glides just above the surface.
When the boat noses into a swell Chuck gets quite a ride.
Once he has the hang of it, fear turns to elation.

                         CHUCK
          YEEE HAAAA!!!!!

                         CHARLIE
          Okay, who's next?

                         PHIL
          You gotta be kidding?  He's a human
          chum line!

                         RICK
          No self respecting shark is gonna
          take a bite out of you.

Chuck's hauled back in and Terry pushes his way to the
front of the line.

                         TERRY
          I'm next!

Terry goes over the side.  Once he gets the hang of it, he
gets into it.  He maneuvers the chair like a plane,
forcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back
to the surface.

OFF THE PORT SIDE

Robin is trolling.  The line takes a tremendous hit and
Robin's reel screams.  Tod is at the wheel and turns.

                         TOD
          There she blows!!

Two hundred feet out something large and pissed has taken
the bait.  The crew turn and look.  Skipper looks out at
Terry still in the bowswain's chair.

                         SKIPPER
          Get him in.

Bill waves at Terry to come on in.

                         BILL
          Come on in!!!

Terry waves him off and disappears back under the waves.
They can't pull him up while he's going under the water.

                         SKIPPER
          Do it now Bill.

Terry pops up, pissed that they're reeling him back in.

Suddenly the animal on the other end of Robin's line
explodes out of the sea.  It's a six foot Thresher shark.
Terry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and
screaming.

                         TERRY
          Get me out!!!  Get me out!!!

                         MIKE
          Oh my god!!  It's a...

                         SKIPPER
                  (calmly)
          Shark.
                  (to Robin)
          Don't lose it son.

George grabs a gaffing hook while Robin fights the rod,
trying to bring in the big fish.

                         GEORGE
          Keep it coming.

Robin battles the fish.  George clumsily tries to help.
The crew make their way to the rear to watch.

                         CHARLIE
          Whoops.

Charlie and Rick and the others heave to get Terry up.
Finally he makes it.  Sprawling onto the deck.

                         TERRY
          Oh Jesus!  Oh Jesus Christ!!

The crew turn and cheer Robin on as he brings the shark
alongside.

                         GEORGE
          He must be two hundred pounds!
          Bring him in close and try to hold
          him steady.

George leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook
into a gill.  Several of the boys hold onto him as the
fish flops around violently.

                         GEORGE
          Got him!

Skipper comes down to inspect the catch.  The shark is
longer than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water,
snapping and twisting.  Terry stands shaking, freaked.
All of them are.

                         RICK
          Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister
          Mary Anne's butt.

The guys laugh nervously.  Terry just stares at the man
eater, but it's infectious.  After a moment he's laughing
too.  Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, now you have something to
          write home about.

More laughter.  Suddenly, Tom, who is lookout on the
foretop, cries out.

                         TOM
          Land ho!!!  Land ho!!!

Everyone turns around to look.  The guys at the stern let
go of George and he nearly tumbles overboard.  In that
instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears
back into the sea.  Robin and George share a stunned look.

                         GEORGE
          Shit.

                         ROBIN
          There's more where that came from.

Skipper returns to the wheelhouse with Alice.  Together
they scan the horizon.  Clouds build over the land ahead.

                         ALICE
          Cheated death again.

He slips an arm around her.

                         SKIPPER
          Yep.


EXT.  ANTIGUA - HARBOR - DAY

A group of islanders have assembled to watch the crew
approach in the long boats.


INT.  LONG BOAT - SAME

Chuck gazes across the strange landscape.  As the boats
dock, the crew pile out and scatter.  Local children
follow them wherever they go.  Chuck, Robin and John find
themselves alone.  Most of the buildings are primitive.
They wander over to a shop.

                         ROBIN
          What do you say?  Cokes?  I'm
          buying.

                         CHUCK & JOHN
          Sure.


EXT.  SHOP

Chuck and Robin reappear, sipping cold Cokes.  Mike and
Chris walk by across the street.  Robin speaks up loud
enough for them to hear.

                         ROBIN
          You're right Chuck.  There's nothing
          quite as refreshing as a cold ten
          cent Coke that only costs ten cents!

The three clink their bottles.  Mike and Chris slink away.


EXT.  COLONIAL FORT - DAY

A crumbling fort overlooks the harbor.  Below, the
Albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water.
Large bronze muzzle-loading cannons still lie in their
gunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that
will never come.

Each of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the
Caribbean view.

                         ROBIN
          You think Skipper and Alice do it?

                         CHUCK
          Do what?

                         ROBIN
          Ya know... "It".

                         CHUCK
          That's like wondering if your mom
          and dad do it.  Who wants to know?

                         JOHN
          She isn't that old.

                         CHUCK
          What do you mean?

                         JOHN
          I mean she looks pretty damn good in
          her all-together for being thirty.

                         ROBIN
          How would you know?

                         JOHN
          Trust me donut.  I know.

                         ROBIN
          What?  Come on...

                         JOHN
          On the dog watch, night after the
          storm, I look down into the skylight
          above Skipper's cabin and there she
          was, peelin' down.

                         CHUCK
          No way!

                         ROBIN
          Come on man, what'd they look like?

                         JOHN
          Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like
          a guy who ain't never seen a pair.

                         ROBIN
          I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.

They crack up.

                         CHUCK
          I walked in on my parents one time.
          It was only like eight o'clock and
          they were in bed and I thought that
          was kinda weird so I just walked in.

                         JOHN
          That's what they get for not locking
          the door.

                         CHUCK
          So I'm standing there and you could
          hear a pin drop.  No breathing or
          snoring... Suddenly it hits me that
          somethin' was goin' on that just
          stopped, really fast, like people
          are holding their breath.

                         ROBIN
          So... What happened?

                         CHUCK
          My mother says in this really low,
          but very awake kind of voice "What?"

John and Robin crack up.

                         ROBIN
          What'd you do?

                         CHUCK
          I said "Sorry, wrong room" and
          walked away.

                         JOHN
          Did you shut the door at least?

They bust up again.  Chuck glares back.

                         CHUCK
          I don't remember.

Robin sits up on his cannon and looks out, suddenly
melancholy.

                         ROBIN
          My parents don't do it anymore.

                         CHUCK
          How do you know?  They might.

                         ROBIN
          'Cause they're getting a divorce.
                  (beat)
          That's why they sent me here.  My
          sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted
          us out of the house so they could
          get down to business.

                         JOHN
          They tell you that?

                         ROBIN
          I figured it out.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah.

                         JOHN
          My old man split along time ago.  It
          doesn't mean anything.  You just
          take care of number one that's all
          that matters.

                         ROBIN
          It matters to me.

                         JOHN
                  (kindly)
          Okay donut.  Whatever you say.

                         CHUCK
          We better get back.

Robin looks up to John.

                         ROBIN
          Did you really see 'em.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - HARBOR - NIGHT

The boat moves off leaving the lights of Antigua behind.
Chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The wind is up and the seas are high.  The ship is under
full sail driving at top speed.  Foam sprays from the bow
as it slices through the water -- what she was born to do.
The crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of
the performance.

Tod is at the wheel with Chris nearby.  The sails tower
above him like a mountain of silk.  He wrestles the wheel,
careful to hold his course against the powerful trade
winds.

Skipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the
compass and nods.

                         SKIPPER
          It's a good sail boys.

Tod and Chris beam.  Compliments are rare from this man.

                         TOD
          Thank you, sir.  Shall we trim the
          main Skipper?  I think we could get
          another knot or two.

Skipper turns and looks at Tod, a twinkle in his eye.

                         SKIPPER
          As you like.

Gravy.  The two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet
tackle.  Phil joins them.

                         PHIL
          What do you say I have a crack at
          the wheel?

                         TOD
          I'd say, fuck off junior.

They laugh.  Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and
angry.  He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart
house.

As Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and
stretches against the powerful wind.

Phil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the
chart house and silently fires.  There is a wicked POP as
the spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed
by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits.

                         TOD
          Jesus Christ!!  Let it out.  Let it
          out!!

The sound brings Skipper onto the deck like a shot.

                         SKIPPER
          Hard to port!  Hard to port!!

Calamity, as Tod cranks the ship into the wind.  The
canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop.  People
dive everywhere to drop sail.

                         SKIPPER
          Start the engine.  All ahead full!!
          Scallop the Square and drop the
          rest!!

He shoots a glare at Tod and Chris.

                         TOD
                  (bewildered)
          I don't know what happened Skipper.
          It just blew out.

Skipper turns to the task at hand without a word.  What
had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and
confusion.

Phil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the
spear gun and smiles to himself at Tod's arrogance turned
humility.


EXT.  DECK - TOBAGO CAYS - DAY

The Albatross has dropped anchor along a remote group of
flat, lush atolls.  Tall palm trees grow almost to the
waters edge.  The crew have the mainsail down and Alice
supervises the repair of the sail.  Phil sits above it all
sunning himself in the bowswain's chair.

                         ROBIN
          Where are you from any way?

                         CHUCK
          Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout
          you?

                         ROBIN
          Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom
          capital of the world'.

                         TOD
          Sorry to here it.

                         CHUCK
          Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya
          know?  Bein' here together an all...

Phil reels himself down.

                         PHIL
          Christ, I'm gonna choke on 'feel
          good'...

Robin looks up, taken back.

                         TOD
          Why are you such a penis Phil.  Do
          you do it on purpose or can't you
          help it.

                         PHIL
          Tug my chain Johnstone.

Skipper comes on deck.  Robin and Chuck flip Phil and
Terry the finger.

                         SKIPPER
          After midterms we'll finish our run
          down to Curacao.

The crew reacts, grumbling.

                         SKIPPER
          I have arranged to host a good will
          cruise for the Dutch students of the
          local school there.

                         PHIL
                  (to Terry)
          Joy, rapture...

                         SKIPPER
          Each one of you will be responsible
          for one student.  I'll expect you to
          be courteous.  You represent this
          school and your country.  We'll sail
          in the morning.

George appears from the galley and rings the ships bell.

                         GEORGE
          That's chow.

The crew drop what they're doing and stampede down into
the cabin.


INT.  CABIN - NIGHT

Robin thrashes in his bunk calling out.  Sweat glistens on
his face.  Chuck stumbles out to his bunk with Rick and
some of the others.

                         RICK
          Hey man, wake up.  Wake up!

They shake him.  Robin wakes, disoriented, eyes filled
with tears.

                         ROBIN
          I was falling...

Phil grumbles from his bunk.

                         PHIL
          Hey, shut up will ya?

                         CHUCK
          It was a bad dream...

                         ROBIN
          It was so real...

                         CHUCK
          Here's the thing; whenever you're
          having a nightmare, all you have to
          do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be
          out of it.  You'll wake up.

Phil rolls over in his bunk trying to go back to sleep.

                         ROBIN
          Who told you that?

                         CHUCK
          My dad.

                         ROBIN
          It works?

                         CHUCK
          Swear to God.  Only good advice he
          ever gave me.  Now, go back to
          sleep.

He pats Robin on the leg.  The guys return to their bunks.
Favor Phil, listening.

                         CHUCK
                  (lingering)
          You okay now?

Robin stares at the photo of his brother.

                         ROBIN
          That's how he died you know.

                         CHUCK
          Who?

                         ROBIN
          My brother.  He fell out of the old
          beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was
          on a camp out.  They started going
          at it, throwin' things, a real knock
          down...
                  (beat)
          They didn't find him 'till the next
          morning.  They didn't even know why
          he was up there.

                         CHUCK
          Jesus, you never told them?

                         ROBIN
          I couldn't.

Phil stares at the ceiling, affected by what he has
overheard.  Someone creeps down the companionway and
whispers.

                         MIKE
                  (hushed)
          Hey you guys, come on!

Shuffling in the darkness.  Phil suddenly realizes, he's
alone.


EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

The dory hangs from her gallows.  Some of the guys slowly
lower her to the water.


INT.  GALLEY - SAME

George is asleep with a book in his lap.  Mike and Chris
slip inside.  The door squeaks, George stirs.  Mike opens
a cabinet and removes a fifth of rum.

Silently, Mike passes the bottle to Chris who passes it to
Tod who passes it to Charlie who drops it down to Robin
who stands in the lowered dory with Chuck.

                         PHIL (O.S.)
          What do you think you're doing?

Startled, Mike and Rick share a look.  Busted.  Phil turns
and runs into John, wearing a broad smile, who shakes his
head.  No way.

                         PHIL
          Forget it.  Count me out!

The crew descend and drag Phil, struggling, into the dory.
They raise a crude sailing rig and silently move off.

A figure stands on top of the chart house, back lit by the
moon.  It's Skipper.  Watching it all.  Letting it unfold.


INT.  GALLEY - NIGHT

Skipper hovers over George, sawing logs.  He tosses a pot
on the floor.

                         GEORGE
                  (bolting up)
          What?!  What's happening?!!

                         SKIPPER
          You're officer of the watch, George.

                         GEORGE
          I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned
          book.  Lawford gave it to me.

The book is "Kafka".  Skipper motions to the empty
cabinet.

                         GEORGE
          Son-of-a-bitch.

                         SKIPPER
          We're short one long boat too.  Come
          on.


EXT.  CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

The boys sit in a circle around a small fire passing the
bottle.  Rick strums his guitar and sings while the rest
join in.

                         RICK
          Oh I was walkin' down Lime street
          one day...

                         ALL
          Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...

                         RICK
          A pretty young maiden she happened
          my way...

                         ALL
          Give me some time to blow the man
          down...

Skipper and George crawl to the top of a sand dune and
watch the boys.  George starts to stand but Skipper puts a
hand on his shoulder.

                         SKIPPER
          I guess we know what the next
          acquisition for the galley is going
          to be...

                         GEORGE
          What's that?

                         SKIPPER
          A padlock.

On the boys.  Phil is drunkest of them all and does a wild
jig as the rest of them sing.

                         RICK
          So to all you sailors who've fought
          wind and whale...

                         ALL
          Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...

                         RICK
          She said "None the better, you all
          go to hell..."

                         ALL
          Give me some time to Blow the man
          down!

They all crack up.

                         CHRIS
          I only have one question.

                         JOHN
          What's that, Canuck?

                         CHRIS
          If we're not on the boat, how come
          the ground is moving?

                         CHUCK
          You think George'll miss the bottle?

                         TERRY
          We'll blame it on Big Daddy.  He's a
          lush.

                         MIKE
          All I know is if that Viking son of
          a bitch puts me on smegma duty one
          more time I'm gonna have to run him
          through.

                         TERRY
                  (mimicking)
          The "Old Man" likes a tight ship!

                         CHARLIE
          "If it moves, shoot it..."

The rest join in.

                         CHUCK
          "If it doesn't move, throw it
          overboard.  If it's too big to throw
          overboard, screw it!"

More laughing.

                         RICK
          You think Old Thunder Nuts will
          figure out that we're A.W.O.L.

Bill drunkenly imitates the Skipper.

                         PHIL
          "There is nothing that goes on, on
          this boat that I don't know about.
          She speaks to me in the night.  So
          don't test me.  Not even a
          little..."

The boys laugh.  On the dune, George shakes his head.

                         GEORGE
          Immortality.

                         SKIPPER
          Spirits have a way of bringing that
          out.

                         GEORGE
          And being sixteen.

                         SKIPPER
          They're in a hurry to grow up.  They
          don't know about consequences or
          responsibility.  That's being
          sixteen too.
                  (beat)
          I promise you one thing...

                         GEORGE
          What's that?

                         SKIPPER
          They'll know about it in the
          morning.

Skipper smiles.


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

The drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach.
As they ready the boat for the trip back Robin looks out
to sea...

                         ROBIN
                  (alarmed)
          Jesus H. Christ.

Tod looks up.

                         TERRY
          What now pork chop?

                         ROBIN
          Look!

The guys turn their gaze to the ocean.  The Albatross...
is gone!

                         TERRY
          Holy shit!  Where'd she go?

The crew is suddenly stone sober.  Stunned.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell is going on?

                         MIKE
          She's gone!  The boat's gone!!

Phil breaks into sort of a blind panic.

                         PHIL
          Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we
          shouldn't have gone.  I tried to
          tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You
          guys made me come!  You made me
          come!!

                         JOHN
          Will you shut up?  You sound like my
          fucking sister.

                         CHUCK
          Alright.  Everybody just stay cool.
          We'll figure this out.

                         MIKE
          Who the hell checked the mooring?

                         ROBIN
          I did.  Why?

                         CHARLIE
          Maybe she pulled free...

                         MIKE
          What if they don't know.  If she's
          adrift, if they're asleep, she could
          run aground.  She could break up on
          the reef.

                         PHIL
                  (to Robin)
          Maybe you didn't check it good
          enough.

                         ROBIN
                  (defensive,
                   frightened)
          I did.  I swear.

Oddly, it's Phil who stands up for Robin.

                         PHIL
          Yeah, well you're really gonna have
          some bad dreams if we find out you
          didn't.

                         JOHN
          That's enough.

                         PHIL
          How the hell are we gonna get outta
          here?

                         JOHN
          We'll think of something.

                         PHIL
          Oh, praise the lord.
                  (announcing)
          Relax everybody.  Everything is
          under control.  The jug head's going
          to think of something.

Without warning.  John lunges at Phil.  Phil screams,
trying to defend himself.  The guys all dive in.  Suddenly
it's an all out brawl.

John out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat
of the boat.

Suddenly, from behind, comes a blistering "THWACK!!" as
Chuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head.
Stunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood dripping
from the back of his head.

                         JOHN
          Nobody calls me an idiot.

He weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand.
The guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover.

                         PHIL
          God damn it man.  I think he broke
          my nose!

                         CHUCK
          Shut up, Phil.

Chuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over and
vomits.

                         TERRY
          Well that's just great.  Now what
          are we supposed to do?

Chuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palm
tree, propping him up.  The others huddle to stay warm.


EXT.  BEACH - MORNING

The crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day.  Bloodied
and sun burned.  A fly buzzes around Rick's face, waking
him.  He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus.  He
gazes across the water, stupefied.

                         RICK
          Oh-my-god...

The others stir and follow his gaze.  The Albatross sits
in exactly the spot where they left her.

                         ROBIN
          I'm not sure if this is really good
          or really bad.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY

The sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly.  George tries
to maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his
hands.

                         GEORGE
          I got a live one!

Skipper, Alice and Bill watch the shoreline as the boys
launch the long boat into the surf.  George is struggling.
A beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but Skipper
never takes his eyes off of his boys.

                         SKIPPER
          The thing about fishing George, is
          you need to let 'em run some.  Give
          'em just enough slack so they don't
          break the line.  But at the same
          time you've gotta keep enough
          tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em
          in slowly so they don't really know
          they're hooked.

Suddenly George's line goes slack.  He nearly falls over
backwards.

                         GEORGE
          I'll try and remember that.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

Hound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys
stand before Skipper and the others.  Skipper looks dark
and angry.

                         SKIPPER
          You know what a loose cannon is?
          'Bout the worst thing that could
          happen to a wooden ship.  All it
          took was one, crashing around the
          deck in a storm... It'd smash
          everything in its way, maybe take
          out a mast or punch a hole right
          through the hull.  Think about it,
          just one cannon not tied down, not
          anchored, could take a whole 'Man of
          War' straight to the bottom.

                         MIKE
                  (aside)
          But we don't have any cannons?

Chris jabs him in the ribs.

                         CHRIS
                  (hushed)
          Shut up!

Skipper turns and faces them.

                         SKIPPER
          Now, if the Skipper were smart, if
          he could see a storm building, why
          he'd cut loose every gun on his
          boat.  Even though it would leave
          him at a disadvantage in battle,
          he'd push 'em into the sea.  Better
          chance running for port than risk
          the entire ship, his crew.

He takes a pause making sure he has their attention for
this part.

                         SKIPPER
          People are like that sometimes.
          They cut loose and before you know
          it, they're knocking holes in
          everything.  So you gotta ask
          yourself if it might not be better
          to just put 'em off before they sink
          the whole thing.  I mean after all,
          you can always get new cannons.

He walks back to his place at the rail.

                         SKIPPER
                  (beat)
          I want a tight ship, everybody
          shaved and in clean clothes when we
          make Curacao.  If it goes well, if
          your mid terms are acceptable, I may
          reconsider my decision about the
          rest of the trip.  That's all.

Dejected, the crew goes below.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

Under sail.  Skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the
crew taking exams.  Each writes furiously as Alice
scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the
chart house door.

As the boys scratch out the problems, John seems
paralyzed.  He looks over at Phil and copies down his
answer.  He checks crib notes hidden in his shorts.  Chuck
and Robin both see this and exchange looks.


INT.  AFT CABIN - DAY

John makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the
head.  Robin follows.  Chuck drops down the aft
companionway, intercepting John.

                         CHUCK
          Where you going?

                         JOHN
          To take a piss.

                         ROBIN
          Really?

John turns around, surprised, sandwiched.

                         JOHN
          Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come
          in and shake it for me?

                         CHUCK
          If you're gonna cheat, you might as
          well copy off somebody who's gonna
          get the answer right.

                         JOHN
          You've gotta be kidding.  Get the
          fuck outta my way!

Chuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove John
inside.

                         JOHN
          What the hell!!!

Chuck manages to pin John.  Robin checks his pockets and
comes up with the crib notes.  Chuck lets go.  John
snatches them, ashamed.

                         CHUCK
          Takin' a piss?

John turns away.

                         ROBIN
          Why, man?

                         JOHN
          I don't have to listen to this.

                         CHUCK
          Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you
          don't, I'm gonna go right up there
          and have a heart to heart with
          Skipper and you'll be on the first
          plane back to idiotville.

John lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.  Robin
leaps on top of John.

                         ROBIN
          Cut it out man!!  Stop it!!!  What's
          the matter with you?  If Phil had
          caught you he'd have ratted you out
          in a second.  You get caught
          cheating, you'll get kicked off the
          boat.

John explodes, tears flowing.

                         JOHN
          I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All
          right?!

                         CHUCK
          What?

He lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his
emotions.

                         JOHN
          I doctored my grades so I'd make the
          cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You
          satisfied?!

                         CHUCK
          You're not a moron.

                         JOHN
          Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to
          get through one chapter of Lawford
          and I still don't have any idea what
          the hell he's talkin' about.  You
          know why it takes me so long to
          write papers?  because I can't
          spell.  While everybody else is
          sleeping, I'm in the rack with a
          flashlight and a dictionary.

John chokes back a sob.

                         JOHN
          Hell, they even kicked me outa vo-
          tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide
          rule.

                         PHIL
          I can show you how to use a slide
          rule.

The three turn around, startled.

                         ROBIN
          How long you been standing there?

                         PHIL
          Long enough.

John looks down, resigned.

                         JOHN
          They were gonna put me into special-
          ed this year.  I stole a copy of my
          transcript, changed all the grades.
          Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never
          pass the boards.

                         CHUCK
          Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll
          make sure you get the grades.  We'll
          start a private study group.  Nobody
          knows.  You'll ace that test.

                         ROBIN
          I'm in.

They turn and look to Phil, who still shows the tell-tail
signs of their fight.

                         PHIL
          Me, too.

                         JOHN
          Why would you do that?

                         CHUCK
          Because we believe in you.
                  (beat)
          Because we're your friends.


EXT.  CURACAO - HARBOR - DUSK

As a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the
Albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks
several hundred yards away.  On the dock, the students of
the school wait.  As soon as the ship is in view, they
start to cheer.  Chuck squints.

                         CHUCK
          What are they doing?

                         ROBIN
          I can't make it out?

Robin calls up to Phil, who is at the wheelhouse.

                         ROBIN
          Hey, Phil... Swing up the 'binocs'
          and tell us what you see.

Phil picks up the binoculars and focuses.

                         PHIL
                  (puzzled)
          They're waving... handkerchiefs or
          something.

                         RICK
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          Maybe they're surrendering.

                         PHIL
          Wait a second...

Phil lowers the binoculars and turns to Skipper.

                         PHIL
          They're girls!  They're all girls!

Skipper shares a knowing look with Alice.

                         TOD
          Gimme those.

Tod snatches the binoculars.

                         TOD
          WHHOOOOAAAAA!!!!!!  WOMEN!!!

Everyone on board rushes to the port side.  Every single
person on the dock is a young girl waving a white
handkerchief.  Spontaneous cheers from the boys.

As the 'Big A' pulls to the dock, John and Tod run for the
gunnel door and swing it open.  The girls flood the deck.

                         BILL
          Good morning, ladies.

They chatter in Dutch and hurry aboard.  Like wall
flowers, Robin, Phil and Chuck stand on top of the chart
house watching utopia unfold before them.

                         ROBIN
          What are we supposed to talk about?

                         PHIL
          You've gotta be kidding?

                         ROBIN
          But, they don't speak English.

                         PHIL
          There are some things that everybody
          does in the same language.

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, but how are you supposed to
          make the first move?

                         PHIL
          Like this!

Phil reaches up for a free line.  With a running start he
swings out over the water...

                         PHIL
          Yeeee Haaaaa!!

He careens back onto the deck and lands in front of two
startled, but impressed girls.  Robin and Chuck applaud.
Phil takes a bow.  All hell is breaking loose.

Skipper and Alice welcome aboard the headmaster, MS.
BOYDE, 50's, dumpy but tough.

                         SKIPPER
          A very enthusiastic welcome.

                         MS. BOYDE
          We don't often have guests.  Our
          girls have been looking forward to
          your visit for some time.  Welcome
          to Curacao.

                         SKIPPER
          Thank you.  You're all ready to sail
          then?

                         MS. BOYDE
          I should think so.

                         ALICE
          I'm sure they won't be disappointed.

A man's voice bellows up from the dock.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Ahoy there!!

Everyone stops and freezes.  Phil turns, disbelieving.
It's his parents, Francis and PEGGY BOUTILLIER, standing
next to a limousine dressed in brightly colored tourist
garb.

                         PEGGY
          Surprise!

                         FRANCIS
          Well, well.  What do we have here?
          A floating brothel?

                         ALICE
                  (cool)
          Hardly.

Francis comes aboard uninvited as usual.

                         FRANCIS
          Well, we thought we'd drop in and
          see if you were all still in one
          piece.

                         SKIPPER
                  (pointed)
          And, of course, we are.

                         FRANCIS
          Well, you never can tell these days,
          can you?

Skipper shoots a look over at Phil who is staring a hole
in the deck.

                         SKIPPER
          What is it we can do for you today?

                         FRANCIS
          Well, we've come to give our boy a
          little break from the monotony.

                         PHIL
          It's not monotonous.

Francis flushes red.

                         FRANCIS
          Never the less...

He turns and joins Peggy on the dock.  Phil is suddenly
full of rage.  This is an invasion of his privacy.
Everyone feels it.

                         FRANCIS
          Hop to boy.  We haven't got all day.

Phil's anger turns to resigned humiliation.  He stops,
staring down at his parents.  Skipper puts a hand on his
shoulder.

                         SKIPPER
          I didn't know, Phil.

Phil nods, head down and walks down the ramp.  All watch
him go, feeling for him.


EXT.  OPEN WATER - DAY

The sails begin to rise but unlike earlier, the guys SING
out like the Vienna Boys Choir and it's having the desired
impressive effect on the women.

                         CREW TOGETHER
          When the sun came up there was
          whisky in the cup/ and not one of us
          was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a
          picture, but it really was the sun/
          then we knew the party was over...

The weather was perfect, brisk and steady under the trade
wind swells.  The voices trail away as the ship moves off.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Curacao seemed out of a dream,
          somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio
          drew further and further away, it
          was home that began to seem unreal,
          drifting somewhere in the foggy
          reaches of our memories.  And I knew
          that each of us was falling in love.
          But not only with these wonderful
          women or the swaying palms and
          porcelain beaches... We were falling
          in love with the experience we were
          sharing, and with who we were
          becoming.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

The crew is getting ready for a farewell party.  Each
member is primping.

                         CHUCK
          Bregitta.  Do you believe it?

                         JOHN
          Believe what?

                         CHUCK
          Her name.
                  (savoring the sound)
          Bregitta.  It's poetry.

                         TERRY
          Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".

                         TOD
          Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're
          talking to a guy whose idea of big
          romance is a palm full of Vaseline.

                         TERRY
          Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't
          seen you swapping spit with anybody.

Tod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket.
It's a pair of girls' cotton underwear.

                         TOD
          That's because I'm discrete, moron.

The guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him.  Just
then Skipper descends the companionway.

                         SKIPPER
          Alright, gentlemen, we sail with the
          tide.  Twenty-three hundred.  Sharp.
          I'm not waiting.  Have a good time
          tonight but be back on time.

The crew cheer.  This means the trip goes on.


EXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT

Decorated with colored paper lanterns and streamers, a
STEEL DRUM BAND softly plays in the b.g.  The crew slow-
dance with their girls, dressed in cotton that seems to
glow against their dark skin.

Ms. Boyde is scrutinizing the body contact between Chuck
and BREGITTA.  Their lips appear pasted together and she
doesn't like it.  Lawford sees what is about to happen and
hands his slimy cigar to George who reacts.

                         LAWFORD
          Hold this, will ya?

Lawford intercepts Ms. Boyde.

                         LAWFORD
          Madam, I would consider it a
          privilege if you would allow me to
          take you on a tour of the dance
          floor.

Ms. Boyde is so flattered, it is all she can do to extend
her hand.  Lawford leads her away and glares at Rick.

                         LAWFORD
          You're very light on your feet Ms.
          Boyde.  Was it you who taught all of
          these young ladies the art of the
          dance?

Ms. Boyde giggles like a school girl.


EXT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Phil and his parents sit outside at a ritzy restaurant.
Phil stares towards the harbor.

                         FRANCIS
          What's wrong, you don't like steak?

                         PHIL
          I should be eating with the crew.

                         FRANCIS
          Humor me.  Eat it anyway.

                         PHIL
          Why are you here?

                         PEGGY
          We missed you.  We wanted to check
          on you.

                         PHIL
          I don't need you spying on me.

                         FRANCIS
          Spying?!

                         PHIL
          I can take care of myself.

                         FRANCIS
                  (sarcastic)
          Oh, really?

                         PHIL
          Look, you put me on this boat in the
          first place.  I didn't want to come
          but I did.  Why do you have to
          embarrass me.  Why can't you just
          leave me alone?

Francis slaps Phil across the face nearly knocking him out
of his chair.  Everyone and everything.  It's humiliating.

                         PEGGY
          Francis!!

She cradles Phil's red face.  He fights the tears.

                         FRANCIS
          Listen to me, you thankless little
          prick.  We're your parents, so don't
          you dare talk to me disrespectfully.
          What the hell is it, this captain?
          Because I'll see him in a rowboat...

                         PHIL
          It has nothing to do with him.

                         FRANCIS
          Well, what does it have to do with?
          Us?

                         PHIL
          No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it
          just be about me?  For once?

Phil pulls free and exits.  He can feel eyes all over him.


EXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT

Alice watches, swept up in the nostalgic romance of it
all.  Skipper joins her.

                         SKIPPER
          He would have loved this.

                         ALICE
          Your father?

                         SKIPPER
          All his years at sea, he never
          stopped talking about these islands.

                         ALICE
          You miss him.

Skipper manages a sad smile.

                         SKIPPER
          Every hour.  Every minute.
                  (pause)
          I wish he was here.  I wish he could
          have sailed our girl.  Seen these
          boys...

She smiles warmly.

                         SKIPPER
          I'd have liked to have said goodbye.

                         ALICE
          He knows.

                         SKIPPER
          You sound so sure.

                         ALICE
          I am about this.

Skipper turns and stares at her deeply.

                         ALICE
          What?

                         SKIPPER
          He never would have believed a woman
          like you existed.

Alice smiles and turns back to the dancers.

                         ALICE
          Do you remember the last time you
          and I danced under the stars?

                         SKIPPER
          Guilty.

                         ALICE
          On the deck of the Yankee, the night
          you asked me to marry you.  We
          weren't much older than they are.

The music changes to a calypso waltz.  Skipper takes Alice
by the hand.

                         SKIPPER
          Would you allow me?

She's sixteen again.  There's something about him that
still makes her blush.

Skipper leads her to the dance floor.  He hesitates,
looking deeply into her eyes.  As they begin to dance, the
boys notice and exchange looks.

Lawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and
smoking cigars.

                         GEORGE
          If I didn't know better I'd say the
          old man was acting almost halfway
          human.

                         LAWFORD
          He is halfway human.

One by one the couples clear for the Skipper and his
bride.  They glide, lost in each others arms.  They dance
a dance for the ages.  As if it might be for the last
time.  The music swells.


EXT.  PIER - NIGHT

Chuck and Bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full
moon hangs above the horizon.  Bregitta doesn't understand
what Chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him.

                         CHUCK
          I can't remember feeling like this
          about myself, a place, someone like
          you.  We've come such a long way,
          seen so much.  But nothing like this.

Bregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand.  He's nervous.

                         CHUCK
          I'm not the best at expressing
          myself.  Maybe the only reason I can
          now is because I know you don't
          understand me.
                  (beat)
          I like you so much.  Too much.  But
          how could I?  I mean, if we can't
          even communicate, how could I know
          you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an
          hour and I'll never see you again.

Bregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses him
tenderly.  Then, in perfect English...

                         BREGITTA
          I like you, too.

Chuck's eyes widen, astonished.  Bregitta smiles, takes
Chuck by the hand, and leads him to a small covered boat
moored to the pier.

                         BREGITTA
          Come on.  We don't have much time.

Blushing deeply, Chuck follows her into the boat.


EXT.  STREET - SAME

Robin walks down the street hand in hand with one of the
girls.  A long string of colored lights illuminate the
length of the street.  Robin clumsily tries to kiss the
girl.  She laughs.

                         ROBIN
                  (defensive)
          What?

Suddenly there's a flash and the sound of breaking glass.
Robin looks up to see Phil staggering, down the street,
smashing each of the colored light bulbs with a stick.  He
showers himself with broken glass and sparks.

                         ROBIN
                  (to girl)
          Wait for me okay.  I'll be right
          back.  I swear.

She smiles sadly and nods.  Robin sprints down the pier
and catches up with Phil.  His feet are bleeding.  He is
completely smashed.

                         ROBIN
          Phil.  What are you doing?

                         PHIL
          Fandango, Junior.
                  (he holds up his
                   stick)
          I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!

                         ROBIN
          No way Phil.  Not like this.

                         PHIL
          Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker
          down the pipe...

THWACK!  He scores another bulb.  Robin jumps out of the
way.

                         PHIL
          It's outta here!

                         ROBIN
          Come on man.  Let's just talk about
          it.

The music drifts from the gardens ahead.  Phil bolts.
Robin chases after him.

                         ROBIN
          Phil!  Wait man... Come on...


EXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT

John shares a joke with Lawford and George.  The calypso
is cranking, but only John hears Phil and Robin crash into
the refreshment table.  Robin struggles to stop Phil.

                         JOHN
                  (to Lawford)
          Be right back.

Lawford nods, oblivious.

ON THE GUYS

John tries to help Robin with Phil.

                         JOHN
          Jesus!  What the hell happened to
          him.

                         PHIL
          Lemme go!  Lemme go!!

                         ROBIN
          I don't know.  We gotta get 'im
          outta here before Skipper sees him
          like this.

                         PHIL
          Son of a bitch!!

Phil kicks and struggles.

                         JOHN
          Phil, if you don't calm down, I'm
          gonna hurt you.  Got it?

They drag him into the darkness.  From near the bandstand
however, Skipper has seen it all.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - NIGHT

The crew lean along the rail waving goodbye to the girls
who wave back with their white handkerchiefs.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Chuck and John hold Phil still as Robin picks shards of
glass out of his feet.  Phil clenches his jaw, but his
eyes are dry.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY

The ship is under full-sail driving before a brisk
following wind.  It takes two on the helm to keep her
safely on course.  Those not on watch are sprawled about
the boat, scraping and 'red-leading' or reading.  Chuck
and Robin sit forward with John, studying.  Lawford paces
the deck, chiding the crew.

                         LAWFORD
          The rust won't wait for you to read
          Conrad, Goodall.

                         JOHN
          Then he shouldn't have written such
          a long poem, Mr. Lawford.

                         LAWFORD
          Read on, young John.  Read on.
          College boards are coming.

John looks down, dejected.  Suddenly Tod cries from the
foretop.

                         TOD
          There they blow!!  There they blow!!
          Dolphins off the bow!!!

Everyone rushes to see.  Dolphins leaping out of the
water.  It's a magnificent game they play with ships.  The
crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close
enough to touch.

Isolated, Phil watches.  Angry, cut off.  Chuck eyes him,
worried.

Bill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick
into the water.  Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere.
Rick pets them as they swim back and forth.  Shear joy.

Phil reaches for the spear gun.  Nobody notices as he
loads and takes aim.

Suddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around.  A large
female dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam
spraying from her blow hole.  She lets out an agonizing
scream.  Phil holds her fast.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Christ!

The crew can only watch, stunned.  Phil is suddenly,
defensive as if waking from a dream.

                         PHIL
          Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.

                         RICK
          No, Phil.  It's a mammal.

Skipper steps on deck, sees the dolphin and Phil with the
spear gun.

                         SKIPPER
                  (quietly)
          Bill, lower a long boat.  We'll
          bring her up with the davit.

A dory is lowered with John and Bill inside.  Once near
the water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a
canvas harness.  The crew hoist her with the davit tackle,
swing her inboard, and gently lower her to the deck.

They gather around the gasping animal.  Alice checks the
wound.  Skipper kneels beside her.

                         SKIPPER
          What do you think?

Alice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin.

                         ALICE
          It's through her lung.

Skipper turns to Phil.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to Phil)
          Nice shot.

Phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away.
Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last
to look away.  Skipper grimly walks over to one of the
deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds
it out to Phil.

                         SKIPPER
          Finish it.

Phil looks at the mallet, horrified.

                         PHIL
                  (stammering)
          I'm not gonna kill it.

                         SKIPPER
          You already have.  Now go on.  Do
          it.

Phil backs away.  Skipper stares at him for a moment, then
walks over to the dolphin.  Robin looks away.  The
sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the
animal seems to silence the world.  There are one of two
thumps of her tail and, it's over.

Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and
approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabs
the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the
pieces into the sea.

                         SKIPPER
          What the hell is wrong with you?!

Phil begins to shake with rage.

                         SKIPPER
          Come on.  You got so much fight in
          you; you wanna kill something?  Take
          your best shot.  The first one's
          free.

Robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away.
For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper
up on the challenge.  Then the impulse passes.

                         SKIPPER
          That's what I thought.
                  (beat)
          You're done.  You're going home.

Skipper turns.  The humiliation is more than Phil can
take.  He lunges after Skipper.  Lawford grabs him.  Phil
swings wildly.

                         PHIL
          You mean-assed bastard!!  You son of
          a bitch!!  You can't do this!!!  You
          can't do this!!!  God damn you!!
          God damn you!!

Lawford leads Phil, struggling, below.  The crew surround
the dead dolphin, stunned.


EXT.  ARUBA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

The Albatross is at anchor in the center of the harbor.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

Phil comes on deck from below with his duffel bag.
Everyone feels bad but no one knows what to say.  Phil
turns to get a second load.

                         CHUCK
          Why'd you do it?

                         PHIL
                  (regretting it)
          What's the difference?

                         CHUCK
          You only hurt yourself you know?

                         PHIL
          Like you really care.  Like any of
          you give a shit what happens to me.

                         RICK
          You're the one who doesn't care,
          Phil.

                         PHIL
          It hurts too much to care.

                         RICK
          About yourself?

                         PHIL
          About anything.

Phil turns and disappears down the companionway.

                         ROBIN
          We shouldn't be putting him off the
          boat.

                         CHRIS
          The guy's out of control.

                         ROBIN
          Everybody's been outta control on
          this trip.
                  (beat)
          Are we a crew or not?  I mean, isn't
          that what this is supposed to be all
          about?

                         MIKE
          You're the last person who should be
          whining about being a "crew".

                         ROBIN
          How do you figure that?

                         MIKE
          Well, I'd sure like to go into the
          subject of vertigo and all, but I
          wouldn't want you to piss yourself.

Robin flushes bright red.  John fires a look at Mike.

                         JOHN
          You're a regular prick you know
          that?

                         MIKE
          Tell it to the dolphin, Goodall.

                         JOHN
          Everybody deserves a second chance,
          ya know?  We'd do the same for you
          Mike.

                         ROBIN
          It's about family isn't it?  I mean
          are we together on this or not?

There is a long pause.  Mike and Chris cave.

                         MIKE
          Hell, do what ever you want.  It
          won't change anything anyway.

Robin exchanges a glance with Chuck and together, they
climb up the companionway.


EXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

Chuck and Robin stand before the door.

                         ROBIN
          I can't go in there.

                         CHUCK
          What are you talking about.

Robin turns away, ashamed.

                         ROBIN
          The guys were right.  It'll mean
          nothing coming from me.  He'll
          listen to you Chuck.  Everybody
          does.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

Skipper and Alice have paperwork spread out in front of
them.  A knock.

                         SKIPPER
          Come.

Chuck enters, awkward.

                         SKIPPER
          What's on your mind?

                         CHUCK
          I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.

Skipper looks up.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, spit it out.

                         CHUCK
          The fact is... We'd like you to give
          Phil another chance.

Alice raises her eyebrows, surprised.

                         SKIPPER
          Can't do it.

                         CHUCK
          Sir...?

                         SKIPPER
          Close the door.  Sit down.

Chuck does as he is told.

                         SKIPPER
          Why do you think I'm sending him
          home?

                         CHUCK
          He killed the dolphin.

Skipper looks at Chuck for a moment.

                         SKIPPER
          The Dolphin was a symptom.

                         CHUCK
          Of what?

                         SKIPPER
          Of a fight he can't win out here.

                         CHUCK
          It's his father sir.  He's
          suffocating him.  We've all seen
          it...

Suddenly it's as if Chuck is talking about his own life.

                         CHUCK
          I mean he has all these expectations
          and he doesn't even know who his own
          kid is.  What right did then have to
          show up here?

                         SKIPPER
          They have every right Chuck.

                         CHUCK
          They send us because they want us to
          change, or grow up or something and
          then they try to keep us the same.

Skipper sits up and studies Chuck for a moment.

                         SKIPPER
          Let me tell you something about
          Phil's father, and your's too.  How
          do you think you got here?  You
          think this is all free, that they
          owe you something?  You think they
          enjoy riding subways and commuter
          trains, driving buses or pulling
          lobster traps?  Work fifty weeks a
          year to keep you in tennis shoes and
          private school?  Look around at how
          the rest of the world lives Chuck.
          We're the luckiest people alive,
          every one of us.  They gave it up
          for you and Phil, and me too my
          friend.

Chuck chews on it.

                         SKIPPER
          There are ground rules in families
          just like on this boat.  If you and
          Phil don't like it, I'm sorry.
          Someday you'll understand that, and
          if you're lucky, you'll come home
          and find your best friend has been
          there all along waiting for you to
          forgive him for being a father.
          It'll be the way it used to be,
          when you were ten and your dad was a
          giant.

Now it's Skipper who is talking about himself.

                         SKIPPER
          Does Phil know how you guys feel?

                         CHUCK
          I don't know.

                         SKIPPER
          You should tell him.  That's
          something he can take with him.

Chuck nods and leaves.


EXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

As Chuck exits he meets Robin's eyes.  He shakes his head.


INT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME

Skipper returns to his paperwork but can feel Alice
watching him.  He senses it.

                         SKIPPER
          I'm all ears.

Alice smiles.

                         ALICE
          You may not like what you hear.

                         SKIPPER
          I can take it.

                         ALICE
          They've become what you wanted.
          They're a crew.  That's why he came.

Skipper puts a loving hand on Alice's shoulder.

                         SKIPPER
          Why did we begin this?

                         ALICE
          We were idealists.

                         SKIPPER
          Because we believed we could make an
          impact out here.  Self reliance and
          community through the disciplines of
          sailing.

                         ALICE
          I haven't forgotten.

                         SKIPPER
          Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's
          just striking out at the world.

                         ALICE
          He has a lot of hurt inside him.

                         SKIPPER
          Well, he better learn to own it.
          Actions have consequences.
                  (beat)
          It's not what happens here Alice,
          it's what they take away with them.

Alice runs her hands across his face.

                         ALICE
          You're still an idealist.

Skipper turns and slips into her arms.

                         SKIPPER
          Oh hell...


EXT.  DECK - DAY

Phil is in the long boat with Skipper, ready to shove off.
Tension is high.  It's as though they're all waiting for
Skipper to give Phil a reprieve.  But, it's not coming.
They mumble goodbyes.  Terry and Rick pass down Phil's
bags.

                         RICK
          Good luck.

Phil nods and turns to Skipper.

                         PHIL
          I'm ready.

Skipper starts to pull the oars to make the crossing to
the dock as the crew watches them go.  Robin turns,
staring at the ships bell.


EXT.  DOCK - SAME

Skipper ties off the boat and Phil hands up his bags.  A
black limousine waits, brooding.  Phil climbs up with
Skipper and stands, stares at it.  The back door opens,
but nobody gets out.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME

The crew stand, watching.

                         CHARLIE
          His ol' man's gonna eat him for
          lunch.

                         JOHN
          I know what that's like.

                         RICK
          Yeah.

Then, suddenly...

                         CHUCK
          My god...

All stares aloft.  In the rigging, climbing up the mast,
is Robin.  With the ships bell in his teeth, he is
sweating every rung.  Perspiration glistens on his brow.
The crew watches, transfixed as he fights his way towards
the foretop.


EXT.  DOCK - SAME

Phil turns to Skipper.  Working up some courage to say
something, anything.  But all that comes out is...

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry.

A pause between them.

                         SKIPPER
          I know, Phil.

Skipper extends a hand and they shake.  Phil is about to
turn, when a familiar sound draws their attention.


EXT.  FORETOP - SAME

Robin, holding on for dear life at the top of the mast,
rings the ships bell triumphantly over his head, waving to
Phil.  Victorious.  Ding ding!  Ding ding!  Ding ding!
The crew begin to cheer.


EXT.  DOCK - SAME

Phil stares back, fighting his emotions.  Slowly he raises
his hand in a single wave of acknowledgement.  The ringing
stops as his eyes meet Robin's.  Waves back.  Skipper
turns.

                         SKIPPER
          They never gave up on you, you know.

Phil chews on it.  Then...

                         PHIL
          Tell 'em I said... thanks.
                  (beat)
          Goodbye Skipper.

ROBIN'S POV

Robin watches as the limo pulls away.  He rings the bell
wildly.  The crew below wave in a show of silent protest.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          As Robin rang him out, we waved in
          silent protest against Skipper's
          decision.  And in the days that
          followed the low morale was matched
          only by a sense of arrogance that
          perhaps the master should step down
          and let his students take over.

AERIAL SHOT

Robin, the Albatross and the drama unfolding below spin
slowly away as we climb, turning, higher and higher.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Foam sprays from her bow as the Albatross slices through
the swells.


INT.  CABIN - SAME

Tod exits the head with a worried look on his face.  He
grabs Chuck by the arm and pulls him aside.  Morale is
extremely low.

                         TOD
          Listen man, I think I have a
          problem.

                         CHUCK
          We all have problems.

                         TOD
          I'm pissin' fire man.

Chuck reacts.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY

Tight on Alice.  Pull back to reveal Tod standing in front
of her with his shorts down around his ankles.  Mortified.

                         ALICE
          Have a nice time in Curacao, did you
          Tod?

Alice gets up and moves to her medicine chest.  Tod starts
to pull up his shorts.

                         ALICE
          Not so fast.

She pulls out a menacingly large looking hypodermic
needle.  Tod's embarrassment turns to alarm.


EXT.  DECK - LATER

The crew stand in line, pissed.  Lawford and George man
the deck with Skipper and exchange amused looks.  The door
opens and Chris exits, red faced, rubbing his backside.
He glares at Tod who sits on the paint locker.

                         CHRIS
          Way-ta-go Valentino.  I never even
          copped a feel in Curacao.

                         TOD
          Yeah well, your sexual orientation
          is not my problem.

                         RICK
          Man, is there a social disease you
          haven't had?

                         CHARLIE
          So much for vestal virgins.

Lawford swings up a pair of binoculars.  A vessel under
power is coming up fast behind them.  He holds the binocs
out to Skipper.

                         LAWFORD
          What do you make of that?

Skipper turns and looks.

                         SKIPPER
          I don't know.

The ship pulls along the port side, keeping a couple
hundred yards between them.  The boys move to the rail.
George sees them first.

                         GEORGE
          Jesus.  She's got guns.

                         SKIPPER
          She's Cuban.

Everyone becomes alarmed.  Even Alice looks concerned.
Suddenly a puff of smoke discharges from the gun boat.

                         SKIPPER
                  (shouting)
          GET DOWN!  EVERYBODY DOWN!!

The entire crew hit the deck as a shell rockets across the
bow exploding in the water.

                         SKIPPER
          Jesus, we're Americans!!!  We're
          Americans!!!

Skipper grabs the American flag and starts waving it.

                         TERRY
          Jesus, they're gonna sink us!!

                         SKIPPER
          Bill drop everything.  Do it now!

The crew scrambles for the rigging, frantically dropping
sail.

                         SKIPPER
                  (hitting each word)
          Who the hell do they think they are?

As the sail comes down, the Albatross slows to a stop.
The Cubans inch closer and begin speaking over a loud
speaker in Spanish.  The seas are high and the two ships
rise and fall with the large swells between them.

                         GEORGE
          They want us to identify ourselves.

Chuck returns with a bull horn.

                         SKIPPER
          Tell them we're the American School
          Ship, Albatross.

George replies in Spanish over the bull horn.  The Cubans
answer.

                         GEORGE
          They think we're carrying Cuban
          refugees.
                  (beat)
          Skipper, they mean to board us.

                         SKIPPER
          Not a chance.  Remind them that
          according to the Geneva Convention,
          firing on a civilian vessel on the
          high sea is an act of war.

Another exchange between George and the Cubans.  The crew
lay flat on the deck, terrified.

                         GEORGE
          They say they are acting on the
          direct authority of Fidel Castro.

Skipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail.  The
Cuban Captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps
into the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels
around pointing both barrels at the Albatross.  Skipper
stands firm, between the shrouds.  Silence.  A standoff.

                         SKIPPER
          Tell 'em to come aboard.

George sends the return message.  There is a pause, then
the murmurs of the relieved crew.  Skipper swings down but
never takes his eyes off the gunboat.

                         SKIPPER
                  (to crew)
          We've come a long way gentlemen.
          But this is no time for heroes.  I
          know you're much more, but I need you
          to be boys right now.  That's an
          order.  Now scatter and find your
          passports.


INT.  CABIN - DAY

Laundry, books and mementos go flying as each boy
scrambles to dig up his passport.  Terry sits among his
things, dazed.  Bill notices.

                         BILL
          What's wrong?


EXT.  DECK - DAY

A small launch filled with Cuban soldiers approaches the
Albatross.  The crew climb on deck and line up along the
Chart House with their passports.  Lawford walks up to
Skipper.

                         LAWFORD
          We've got a problem.

                         SKIPPER
          What's that?

                         LAWFORD
          Terry left his passport in Curacao.
          We could hide him...

                         SKIPPER
          No.  Bring him on deck with the
          others.

The Cubans cast their lines up and climb aboard carrying
side arms.  Terry reluctantly joins his crew mates.  The
COMMANDING OFFICER faces Skipper as his men go down the
line checking the passports.  Others search the ship.

                         COMMANDER
          Chicken is a fool's game captain.

                         SKIPPER
          So is violating international law.

                         COMMANDER
          But you invited is aboard.

                         SKIPPER
          Your cannons made a compelling
          argument.

One of the Cubans pulls Terry out of line and brings him
forward.  He alerts the Commander in Spanish.

                         COMMANDER
          Stow away?

                         SKIPPER
          He left his passport in Curacao.
          It's being mailed to Panama.

                         COMMANDER
          That is unfortunate.  We'll have to
          take him with us.

Terry is petrified.

                         LAWFORD
          If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a
          dress.

                         SKIPPER
          Nobody aboard my ship is going
          anywhere.

Skipper stares him down.  The Commander signals to one of
his men who disappears into the Chart House.

                         COMMANDER
          Perhaps in appreciation for our
          country's pursuit of peace, you
          might offer us some, token of
          gratitude.

Skipper doesn't really have a choice.

                         SKIPPER
          What do you want?

The Cuban returns from the Chart House with the Ships
sextant and hands it to the Commander.

                         COMMANDER
          This.  And...

Pointing to the ships compass.

                         COMMANDER
          ... and that.

                         GEORGE
          You've got to be kidding!!

                         SKIPPER
                  (cold)
          Take it.

Without hesitation the Cubans pull the large brass compass
from its base.

                         SKIPPER
          Now, get the hell off my ship.

As they leave the ship, they pause.  The Commander looks
back at the Skipper, then deliberately drops both sextant
and compass into the sea.

                         COMMANDER
          You'll really have something to
          teach your students now.

Skipper stands towering above them.  The Cuban captain
smiles up at him.  Amazingly, Skipper addresses him in
perfect Spanish.

                         SKIPPER
          Las estrellas es lo unico, que un
          marinero verdadero se mesesita para
          encontrarse.  Verdade Patron?

The Cubans stare back, frowning, amazed as they motor
away.

The crew are stunned by what they have just witnessed.
Skipper turns and meets the eyes of admiration, humility
and complete respect.  He joins Alice at the helm.  They
linger for a moment.

                         CHUCK
          What'd he say?

George smiles, impressed as well.

                         GEORGE
          He told them real sailors need only
          the stars.

With a new attitude, they turn to Skipper.

                         SKIPPER
          Alright then, let's get outta here.

The crew bolt to there positions.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          With staff and string he showed us
          how to build a sextant.  As we rode
          the trades, he shared the ancient
          secrets of how to read the waves and
          follow stars.  And some mornings
          later, bathed in the orange glow of
          a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea
          like a phoenix.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - PANAMA CANAL - DAY

Panama appears on the horizon.  The Albatross is dwarfed
by the huge freighters moored around her, as she moves
through the locks.  The crew stand on deck in quiet
reverence.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

The sounds of slumber fill the cabin.  All seems well with
the world.  Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.  A huge
bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a
trident in his hand.

Chuck wakes with a start.  He bolts upright to see the
horrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering
before him.  He tries to scream, but hands cover his
mouth.  He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.


EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

The Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship.
Where the sails once were, only shredded fabric.  All of
the crew have been brought on deck.  Powdered faces glow,
surreal.

John's head has been shaved into a mohawk.  Robin, Rick
and Chris have been reduced to crew cuts.  The shears
start over Chuck's head.  Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY
JONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge
with the rest of the crew.

                         NEPTUNE
          Hold fast that polliwog and make him
          presentable.

Chuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face
powdered.

                         NEPTUNE
          Let it be known that on this day in
          the year nineteen hundred and sixty-
          one there appeared within the limits
          of my royal kingdom, the sailing
          ship brigantine Albatross, bound for
          Galapagos.  All vessels that sail my
          domain shall be subject to the
          scrutiny of the underworld...

Terry is brought topside kicking and screaming.

                         NEPTUNE
          Silence!!!

Terry shuts up and succumbs to the same fate as the rest.

                         NEPTUNE
          Tonight you shall all enter the
          Order of the Shellbacks.  Only when
          you have been duly initiated shall
          you enjoy the mysteries and
          protection of the trident.  So, let
          the festivities begin...


EXT.  HELM - NIGHT

Neptune and his court sit smoking Havana cigars as each
member of the crew present themselves.  Robin dressed like
a pig and crawls around snorting.

John's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does
a rain dance.  Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet,
hops around like a frog.  Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's
girlfriend and must sing everything he says.  Charlie is
dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck.
Frenetic chaos.


EXT.  DECK - LATER

Neptune and his court lead a procession around the
perimeter of the deck.  The crew follows.  They stamp
their feet and chant.

                         ALL
          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!
          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!
          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!

They move faster and faster around the boat.  They shout
louder and louder, faster and faster until they have all
worked themselves into a frenzy.


EXT.  BOW - DAWN

Davey Jones, holds a large turtle shell over the crews
heads.  As each one passes before him he pours blood from
the turtle shell onto their heads.  It runs down,
streaking their floured faces and necks.  As the ritual
progresses, Neptune speaks.

                         NEPTUNE
          By virtue of the power inherited by
          me, I do hereby command all of my
          subjects, such as mermaids, sea
          serpents, dolphins, whales, sharks
          and turtles, from eating, playing
          with, or otherwise molesting this
          vessel or her crew.  Let it be
          remembered that on this, my
          Equatorial Domain on Longitude 88'
          20' 13" on this 532nd in the year of
          the dolphin, you entered the Order
          of the Shellbacks!!

The crew cheer and embrace.  Skipper calls from the wheel.

                         SKIPPER
          Land ho!


EXT.  GALAPAGOS ISLANDS - DAY

The crew stop their celebrating and gather at the port
bow.  Ahead, glowing orange with the dawn, the islands of
Galapagos.  It's desolate landscape of silent volcanoes
and ancient lava flows that spill into the sea.

The faces of the boys, still streaked with the indignities
of the night's ordeal, stand silently before their final
destination.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          We had journeyed over six thousand
          miles to the very edge of the earth.
          Like Darwin before us, we would
          witness the bliss of nature in the
          absence of man.  And it was as if
          the Albatross had forded time,
          leaving it behind.  In the heat of
          those equatorial days, on the virgin
          onyx beaches and shifting coral
          dunes, one could expect to find
          sunning iguanas, nesting frigates
          and perchance... the footprints of
          God.


EXT.  BEACH - SHIPWRECK BAY - DAY

The Albatross rests at anchor.  On the beach, the crew
watch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the
ancient guano cliffs.  So unaccustomed are these creatures
to man, that they have no fear.


EXT.  LAGOON - DAY

Chuck, John and Rick snorkel among the playful SEA LIONS.
They dart and swim like otters among their new human
friends.


EXT.  LAVA OUTCROPPING - DAY

Terry, Chris, Chuck and Mike stand taking notes on exotic
birds.  Frigates, hawks, flamingos, pelicans, boobies, and
of course... albatrosses.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY

The crew are sprawled across the deck taking final exams.
Alice walks among them.  Chuck throws an anxious look
towards John who is buried in his test.


EXT.  GRASSY LOWLANDS - DAY

Boobies nest in the grass.  Thousands of them and
amazingly, the crew can walk among them without them
batting an eye.  Chuck and Robin watch as the iguanas
sneak into unattended nests and steal eggs.


EXT.  DUNES - DAY

Chuck is alone gazing over the shoreline.  A huge flock of
finches darken the sky, circling the black sand beach.
Pure magic.


EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Beyond, the anchored Albatross rocks and bounces in a
blue-sky gale.  Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod
stand by a dory watching the sea build.  They wear only
tattered shorts, their hair sun bleached and their skin
dark.

                         RICK
          We're here for the night.

                         TOD
          Yeah.


EXT.  ROCKS - SAME

Tight.  The eyes of predators.  Sharp, cunning, hungry.


EXT.  BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY

A lone wild goat grazes on the beach.  It looks up,
sensing something, unfamiliar, then, returns to it's
grazing.

Tight.  Thundering bare feet on the black sand.

The goat looks up again, this time it sees five
Homosapiens bearing down on him.  They come naked,
swinging their shredded clothing above their heads like
lassos.  Shouting, whooping, primal.  The goat bolts for
its life.

Pounding through the waterline like the wild horses of
Sable, the hunters charge after the hunted, closing.  The
goat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known.

The beach is broad and long with no cover.  The hunters
are gaining on the goat.  Splashing feet pound closer...

Suddenly they are upon the goat.  But, instead of
attacking it, they just run through it, passing it.  The
goat pulls up and stops, breathless, watching the naked
humans run.

Close on the faces of brothers, matching each other, step
for step.  The music builds as we...

FREEZE FRAME


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Wild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man.
The rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting.
The heaping of driftwood into piles.  Taught and powerful,
the glistening bodies of young men.

Blue sparks leap from striking flint against stone.  A
flame is born.  Voices howl in guttural triumph.

As the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of
men pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance.

The goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance
builds to a frenzy.  The night sky is filled with the
building sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting
voices.


EXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME

The wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water.
The flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning
the white hull of the ship, a deep flickering orange.  The
word A-L-B-A-T-R-O-S-S has been spelled in huge flaming
letters.  Alice joins Skipper at his place by the rail
watching.

                         ALICE
          What are they doing?

                         SKIPPER
          Claiming their place in the world.


EXT.  SHORELINE - DAWN

The white surf hisses as it washes among the cinders of
the evenings ritual.  The Galapagos have been returned,
for now, to the frigates and the iguanas.

Across the water against the rising sun, the Albatross,
under full sail, is bound for home.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

The crew stand at their posts.  The yards and foretop are
trimmed with sailors, their faces taught and their bodies
hard.  No one looks back.


EXT.  DECK - PANAMA CANAL - DAY

Alice steps onto the deck from the chart house with papers
in her hands.

                         ALICE
          Well gentlemen, I have the results
          of your college board scores.  I
          think most of you will be pleased.

The crew members collect their exams.  Chuck notices John
at the bow, alone, lost.

                         CHUCK
          You okay?

                         JOHN
          Yeah.  How'd you do.

Chuck looks down at his exam apprehensively.

                         CHUCK
          Ninety-six.

                         JOHN
          Congratulations.

                         CHUCK
          What about you?

John slowly passes his test to Chuck.

                         CHUCK
          It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!

                         JOHN
          I know.

                         CHUCK
                  (excited)
          You know?  Then why are you up here
          looking like you're about to jump
          overboard?!

                         JOHN
          I just can't believe it.

                         CHUCK
          This is your moment, don't you see?
          The instant when you know that your
          life is never going to be the same
          again.  When you stand up and are
          counted.

John tries to choke back his emotions.

                         JOHN
          I couldn't have done it without you.

                         CHUCK
          Yes you could.  You did.
                  (holding up the
                   exam)
          This is all you.  Nobody else.

John looks out.

                         JOHN
          Thank you.

Chuck smiles and joins John's gaze over the water.

                         CHUCK
          Feels different doesn't it?

                         JOHN
          What?

                         CHUCK
          That we're going back.  I don't want
          it to end.  I don't want to be what
          I was when I left.

                         JOHN
          What was that?

                         CHUCK
          Anonymous.

Chuck looks at his test grimacing.

                         CHUCK
          I've been getting ninety-sixes my
          whole life.  It's what they expect.
          After all this, I still haven't
          figured it out.

                         JOHN
          Figured what out?

                         CHUCK
          Who I am, outside of this boat.
          What the hell I'm doing here.

                         JOHN
          I'll tell you who you are.  You're
          the glue.  You're the thing that
          holds everybody around you together.
          You're strong, you listen and you
          see things in people the rest of us
          can't.  It's a gift.

It's Chuck's turn to fight emotion.

                         CHUCK
          You know, I never had friends like
          this.

                         JOHN
          Me either.

                         CHUCK
          I feel like... we can do anything.

John smiles, clutching his exam.

                         JOHN
          We can.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          In the fading hours of that Pacific
          dusk, with nothing left to confess,
          for the first time we felt safe,
          capable, sure of who we were and
          where we were going.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - DAWN

The crew sleep in their bunks.  Lawford's voice rumbles
down the companionway.

                         LAWFORD
          A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A
          wind that follows fast, And fills
          the white and rushing sail, And
          bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise
          you salty dogs.  The watch is on.

Chuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out.  The dumb waiter
clatters down from the galley with the morning's
breakfast.  Skipper and some of the crew are already
eating.


EXT.  DECK - DAY

The Albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage
of what little wind there is.  The skies are gray and
dank.  Tod and Terry are at the helm.  Chuck and John are
amid ship.  John relieves Bill on the forward watch.

                         CHUCK
          Looks like we're gonna get wet.

                         BILL
          Well, we need it.  I want to take a
          nice long bath and catch some water
          for my laundry.

                         JOHN
          Save some for me will you?

                         BILL
          You got it.  I'm going below.

Suddenly, a huge lightning bolt explodes out of the sky
and strikes the water a hundred feet off of the starboard
beam.  Everyone jumps.

                         TOD
          Jesus!!

Skipper bolts onto the deck.

                         SKIPPER
          Everybody okay?

The crew nod sheepishly.  A very close call.

                         SKIPPER
          All hands keep out of the rigging
          and stay clear of the masts.

The clouds grow dark but no more lighting.  Tod laughs
nervously.  Everybody joins in.  It's contagious.  Even
Skipper manages a smile.

                         SKIPPER
          All right gentlemen.  Thor's had his
          fun.  Let's keep a keen eye.

Skipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly, a
powerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree
list to the starboard.  Skipper stops and turns.

Instinctively, John and Chuck spring for the rigging to
drop sail.

                         SKIPPER
                  (sharply)
          No!  Stay down!!

Skipper stares at the sky with the intensity of a cobra.
Waiting.  The wind eases.  It becomes eerily still.  The
ship slows and the sails go slack.  Silence.  Skipper
maintains his vigil.

CLOSE ON WATER

Foam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like
the invisible footprint of a locomotive.  John sees it
first.

                         JOHN
                  (shouting)
          HERE IT COMES!!!

Everybody turns and looks.  Skipper's eyes suddenly widen
as he realizes...

                         SKIPPER
                  (in a whisper)
          White Squall!

The charging wall of wind slams into the topsails so hard
it send a shudder throughout the ship.  The wheel is
nearly ripped out of Tod's hands.  Instinctively, he tries
to turn the ship into the wind.

                         SKIPPER
          Hard to starboard!!!  Hard to
          starboard!!!

Confused, panicked, Tod keeps turning to the left, into
the wind.  Skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when
the ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the
deck.

                         TOD
          No, hard to port!

                         SKIPPER
          TURN THE GOD DAMNED WHEEL TO THE
          RIGHT!!!

Finally, Tod does as he is told.  But as soon as the ship
starts to come about, the vicious wind drives her further
onto her side.  As the deck becomes vertical Chuck half
slips, half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Robin, Chris, Bill, Mike and Rick are seated at the table
finishing breakfast as the ship starts to go.  They all
share growing alarm as they watch the table reach it's
maximum angle.  Dishes start sliding off.

                         BILL
          Get out!!  Everybody out!!


EXT.  DECK - SAME

Skipper manages to grab the ax mounted on the chart house
and cuts the mainsheet with a single blow.  But it's too
late.  The tall masts plunge into the ocean and the sails
scoop tons of sea water, pinning the Albatross on her
side.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME

Alice struggles towards the door.  The book case tears out
of the wall and strikes her.  She drops to her knees.  The
door swings open in front of her.  She reels for a moment
and then loses consciousness.


INT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME

Lawford, Charlie and George are all hurled out of their
bunks.  The world is suddenly sideways.  Lawford leaps up,
pushing the others towards the companionway ladder.

                         LAWFORD
          GO, GO, GO!!!  TOPSIDE!!!  Come on
          Charlie!  George, get them out!!

George disappears into the main cabin.  Lawford manages to
get Charlie out.  As Lawford reaches the top of the ladder
sea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back
into the bowels of the ship.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Robin is through the companionway in the chart house with
Mike right behind him.  But instead of exiting, he holds
the door open against the sea so that Mike can escape.

Mike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it
closed, pinning Robin's arm.  He struggles to push
through.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

John slashes at the lines securing the starboard lifeboat
with his knife and manages to free it before it is dragged
to the bottom.  He scrambles through the collapsed rigging
tangled above him for the port lifeboat.

AT THE STERN

The Albatross is going down.  Fast.  Chuck and Tod stand
on the after skylight.  Chuck catches glimpses of the
struggle going on below.

                         CHUCK
          My God, they're drowning!

Skipper catches a glimpse of Alice through the skylight.
Water washes over her but she doesn't move.

                         SKIPPER
          Oh please, no.  Not this woman.


INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME

Skipper's face is pressed hard against the skylight.  His
muffled voice penetrates the cabin.  Alice stirs.  She
looks around, delirious.

                         SKIPPER
          Alice, get up!!  Come on girl!!

He pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the
planks, fingers bleeding.  Alice looks up confused but
calm and finds Skipper's eyes.

ON THE DECK

Panicked for the first time in his life Slipper swings the
ax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of
splinters into the water.

                         SKIPPER
          Get out!!  Get out!!  Jesus Christ,
          please God, Alice get out!!!

But after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip
beneath the sea.


INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME

Water thunders in from every possible exit.  Chris and
Rick push Bill towards the dumbwaiter.   

                         RICK
          Bill, you go.  We'll be right behind
          you.

Before he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the
tiny shaft.  Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser
smashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious.  But the
pressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the
galley and out onto the deck.


EXT.  DECK - SAME

Skipper struggles to reach John and the second life boat
but sees that it is tangled in the rigging.

                         SKIPPER
          Johnny, it's not good.

John defies him and keeps cutting.  The ship is almost
completely submerged.

                         JOHN
          I can get it!

Suddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges
into the water taking lines and rope with it.  John
becomes tangled and is dragged into the water.  Only his
superior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and
keep cutting.

The Albatross slips beneath the surface.  Instead of
trying to free himself John keeps slashing at the lifeboat
lines as he disappears, swallowed by the sea.


INT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME

Eerie silence.  Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket.
Debris float around.  He begins to panic as the water
around him rises.

                         LAWFORD
          My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!!

He takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.  Then
suddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure
within.

ON THE SURFACE

Lawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the
surface.


EXT.  SURFACE - SAME

Chuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house
door as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'.  Suddenly the ship
rolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting up
like a huge dorsal fin.


EXT.  UNDERWATER - SAME

Chuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still
finds Robin's arm.  They clasp tightly, but Chuck just
can't budge the door.  Then, strangely, Robin releases
Chuck's arm and pulls it back through the door.  Chuck
looks up, startled.  The small round window in the door is
illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside.

Through the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes.
He fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket.  Robin takes
a last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him.

He meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange
acceptance.  They both know what's happening.  But Robin
has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him.  He
presses his hand to the glass.  Chuck does the same.  Then
with a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door,
disappearing into the darkness and eternity.


EXT.  SURFACE - SAME

Chuck breaks the surface, gasping for air.  He looks
around, frantic.  He sees nothing but the sea swells and
debris.  All that remains is the sound of the wind and
rain on the water.

Suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of
foam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water
like shattered lances as the ship rights herself
underwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as if
in a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins
to rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire length
explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.

ON THE DECK

Like Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of
tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long
boat.

And for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as
if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea.  Some
of the boys begin to cheer prematurely.  But Skipper knows
better.  She's filled to the gills with sea water.

She shutters.  Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked
to the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing,
as she finally goes.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Survivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the
watery tempest.  Strangely, the wind subsides.  The sea
becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the
water.

                         CHUCK
          OH GOD!!!!!

His scream echoes, for the grief of all.

ON THE SURFACE

There is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips
beneath the waves like a stone.  The stunned crew can only
watch.

Then, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the
surface.

Skipper fights off his emotions.  He knows what it means.
John died cutting it free.

Terry and Bill hang onto a life ring.  Blood runs from
Bill's head.  Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto
the side of the other freed life boat which has been
swamped.  Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but
alive.  Several of the boys help pull him towards the
boat.

Skipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for
those not accounted for.  But, they are gone.

Among the wreckage, the roof of the chart house.  The only
sound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell,
Robin's bell, still secure in it's fitting.


EXT.  LIFE BOAT - DAY

The boats have been floated and tied together.  Skipper is
in one, Lawford in the other.  One of the two boats has
been rigged with sail.  Skipper stands in the bow staring
into the ink blue water.

                         SKIPPER
          Raise your sail, Bill.  North, north-
          east.  Keep a sharp look out for
          Florida.

Bill studies him for a moment, then...

                         BILL
          Maybe we could wait around a little
          longer, sir...

There is a long pause before Skipper answers.

                         SKIPPER
                  (quietly)
          She's gone... She's gone.

There is something remarkably touching about this young
man trying to take care of him.  He puts a hand on
Skipper's shoulder.  It almost makes him crack.  He pats
Bill's hand gently.

                         SKIPPER
          Carry on.

                         BILL
          Yes sir.

                         SKIPPER
          North, north-east.
                  (beat)
          And Dick, please make a note of our
          final position.

Lawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floating
wreckage around them, silent, lost.

Suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  The
survivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again.

Chuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It's
suddenly alive... With sharks.

                         LAWFORD
          Hands and feet inside the boats.

They come by the dozens.  Ramming the boats and rummaging
through the debris.  They swarm around the boats until it
seems as if the water is boiling.  Chuck picks up an oar
and starts beating wildly at the sharks.

                         CHUCK
          AAAAHHHH!!!!

The others take up the cause and in a moment they are all
screaming and cursing the sharks.  It's a frenzy of grief
and anger.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          We slashed at the sharks as if
          striking out at the finger of God.
          And we all begged silently for the
          ability to understand what had
          happened.  But, if there was a God
          that day, his answer came only in
          the moaning wind and our questions
          were left to drift unanswered, in
          the titanic ocean of our deepest
          grief.

Exhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost.

                         CHUCK
                  (hushed)
          Wake up.  Wake up.  1-2-3 wake up.

Like Robin's nightmare of his brother, this is all too
real.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The tramp freighter GRAN RIO steams toward the life boats.
The crew stand silently, watching as the ship approaches.


EXT.  SHIP - DAY

Chuck stands on the deck of the Gran Rio as the last of
the crew scramble up cargo netting hung over the side.
Chuck stares out numbly watching as the two deserted long
boats drift away.


EXT.  DECK - GRAN RIO - DAY

Chuck, now dressed, stands in the same spot at the rail,
staring out.  A muffled sound pulls Chuck into the
present.  He walks slowly down the after deck to a cabin
door where sobbing escapes from the other side.  Chuck
turns the handle and cracks the door.


INT.  CABIN - SAME

Curled up on the floor next to his bunk is Skipper.  A
look of shock comes over Chuck's face.  Skipper has come
completely unglued, sobbing deeply.

                         CHUCK
                  (tentative)
          Skipper?

Skipper turns slowly, looking up.  His eyes are red and
his face streaked with tears.  He looks at Chuck almost as
if he doesn't know who he is.  Lost.

                         SKIPPER
          I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.

Chuck reels.  It sounds more like a confession than an
outpouring of sadness.  Chuck closes the door.


EXT.  HARBOR - TAMPA FLORIDA - DAY

Skipper, back in control, and the crew, stand along the
port rail of the Gran Rio.  A small flotilla of pleasure
boats surround the ship and hundreds of people line the
pier.  It's an intimidating sight.

ON THE PIER

Pensive, worried, angry faces of parents and families.
Chaos.  Coast Guard Officials try to hold back the mob.

                         MAN
          What about the manifest!!  What
          about my son!!!

                         WOMAN
          How many made it?  Nobody will tell
          us anything!!

                         OFFICER
          We don't have a list of survivors
          yet.  Please stand back.  Don't
          push!

Angry shouts drown him out.

ON THE DECK

The CAPTAIN of the Gran Rio comes down from the bridge
with some of his officers and stand with Skipper and the
others.  Several COAST GUARD OFFICERS join them on the
deck.

Skipper turns to the Captain and extends his hand.

                         SKIPPER
          Thank you.

The Captain nods.  Skipper turns to his crew, looking over
them.  A smile of deep pride passes his lips.  They all
see it.  Then, between the Coast Guard Officers, he walks
down the ramp.  Lawford and the crew fall in behind.


EXT.  PIER - SAME

A shouting mob waits for them.  Reporters and spectators
shout and call out questions.  It reaches a fever pitch as
the crew descend.  Skipper reaches the bottom of the ramp,
his eyes meet a cool, familiar face.  Francis Boutillier.
Phil stands next to him, staring at the ground.

                         FRANCIS
                  (above the shouting)
          Welcome home.

Skipper is shoved forward by the crowd pushing and
shoving.  The crew follow but are swept away.  Charlie
stops in front of Phil.

                         CHARLIE
          Phil?

Flash bulbs explode.  Charlie and the others are descended
upon as reporters bark out questions.

                         REPORTER #1
                  (shouting)
          What the hell happened out there
          captain?

                         REPORTER #2
          How many boys did you lose...?  And
          how come you didn't go down with
          your ship?

Parents begin to realize who has been lost.  Agonizing
cries mix with jubilation.  It's emotional chaos.  The
crew members are driven apart, they call to each other,
suddenly aware of what's happening.

                         TOD
                  (panicked)
          Charlie!!  Bill!!

Terry suddenly finds himself smothered in the arms of his
MOTHER.  He strains to see what is happening to his
shipmates.

                         TERRY'S MOTHER
          Oh, sweetheart!  Look at you...

                         TERRY
          Skipper!!

Reporters corner them blocking his view.  More reporters
clamor after Skipper, who doesn't reply.

                         REPORTER #3
          Captain, is it true that the ship was
          hit by a "White Squall"?

                         REPORTER #2
          Is it true the first mate is only
          fifteen?

Bill steps in between them.

                         BILL
          It wasn't his fault mister...

                         REPORTER #4
          The National Weather Service says
          "White Squalls" are a meteorological
          phenomenon of the imagination.
          Would you care to comment of that?
          Don't you have anything to say to
          these parents?!!

The reporter pops a flash picture in Skipper's face.
Skipper flies around and knocks the camera to the ground.
The reporter jumps back, startled.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes I do.  And it's private.  Very
          private.

Skipper is swept away towards the CUSTOMS BOOTH by COAST
GUARD OFFICERS.  Skipper surrenders the manifest and it is
stapled to the outside of the door.


INT.  CUSTOMS HUT - SAME

Skipper is whisked inside.  The Coast Guard Officers lock
the doors behind them.

                         OFFICER
          Sit down Captain.  We'll have a car
          here in a few minutes.  Can I get
          you a cup of coffee?

                         SKIPPER
          No, thank you.

Skipper sits.  The wails of family members can be heard as
they see the list outside.  Flash bulbs and faces press
against the windows shouting questions.  He just stares at
the floor.

OUTSIDE

From above we can see the group swarm around the the booth
like angry hornets.  The crew are fractured and pulled
apart from each other.  Charles, fights his way through
the crowd.

                         CHARLES
          Chuck!  Chuck!!!

Chuck tries to get to him.

                         CHUCK
          Dad!

They embrace.  Flash bulbs explode all around them.

                         CHUCK
          Where's Mom?

                         CHARLES
          I couldn't bring her down here until
          I knew you were safe.

A WOMAN

Stands, staring at the empty ramp.  Lost.  A man comes up
behind her and leads her away.

A reporter shoves a microphone in Chuck's face.

                         REPORTER #5
          Was it the Skipper's fault?  And is
          it true drinking was permitted on
          board?  Why did the ship really go
          down?

Charles grabs the guy and shoves him back into the crowd.
Chuck strains to see his crew mates but they have been
swept away.

                         CHARLES
          Come on.

Charles puts his arm around Chuck, still barefoot, and
together, they walk away.  Photographers trail after them,
popping off a few last photos.  Chuck turns and looks
back.


INT.  CAR MOVING - DOWNTOWN - DAY

A ride reminiscent of the one Chuck and his father took
before the journey began.  There is a gulf of silence
between them.  Charles breaks it.

                         CHARLES
          I thought we'd find a store, get you
          fixed up and then get you some
          lunch.  That sound good?

                         CHUCK
          Yeah, sure.

Chuck stares out the window at the traffic and congestion.
A car in front of them runs a red light.  Charles slams on
the brakes.  Chuck is shaken up.  Charles notices.

                         CHARLES
          I'm sorry, son.  Are you okay?

Chuck manages a nod.


INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Lavish and conspicuous by Chuck's recent standards, the
store is crowded and jammed with merchandise.
Claustrophobic.  Cash registers ring and MUZAK drifts in
from above.  Chuck follows as Charles pulls things off of
hangers and piles them into Chuck's arms.

                         CHARLES
          Why don't you go and try some of
          that on?

                         CHUCK
          Okay.


EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Charles peruses the racks.  He calls to Chuck.

                         CHARLES
          How're you doing in there?

Chuck calls from a dressing room.

                         CHUCK (O.S.)
          Fine.

                         CHARLES
          All right.  I'm gonna wander over
          and look at some shoes...


INT.  DRESSING ROOM - SAME

Chuck is curled up in the floor of the tiny booth.  Still
dressed in the clothes from the Gran Rio, perspiration
beads on his skin.

                         CHUCK
                  (calling out)
          Okay.

Tears stream down his face.  He looks up and sees himself
in the mirror.  The eyes that look back are eyes of the
ages.  Involuntary sobs.  He begins to shake.  The tiny
booth suddenly like a crypt.  Tight, with no air.  Chuck
lets out a gasp.

                         CHUCK
          Oh God...

Someone pulls open the curtain.  A MAN, from the next
booth, fat and middle aged stands before Chuck in a pair
of pants still sporting the price tags.  He looks down.

                         MAN
          You okay, kid?

Chuck is suddenly in the throws of a full-on anxiety
attack.  He leaps up and pushes past the man.


EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - SAME

Chuck explodes out of the dressing room.  Running, almost
blind, he crashes into a rack of clothes.  Charles looks
up as he scrambles to his feet and bolts for the doors.

                         CHARLES
          Chuck!!


EXT.  STREET - SAME

Charles bursts through the doors, looking up and down the
street, but Chuck is... gone.


EXT.  BEACH - SAME

The setting sun paints Chuck's face with golden light.  He
stares out across the water.  Charles walks up behind him.

                         CHUCK
          When we were growing up I always
          felt like you would take care of
          things, that everything would be
          okay.
                  (beat)
          But you can't make this okay, can
          you?

                         CHARLES
          No, I can't.

Charles puts his arm around his son.  Together they turn
and walk back towards the boardwalk, and the world.


INT.  COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Skipper sits across from a Coast Guard Officer, TYLER, 60.
Tyler pulls out a file and lays it on the table.

                         TYLER
          There are allegations questioning
          your competence with regard to the
          command of the Albatross.  I have
          been instructed to convene a formal
          tribunal to determine whether or not
          negligence played a part in the
          sinking.

                         SKIPPER
          I understand.

                         TYLER
          May I ask you something?

Skipper nods.

                         TYLER
          How'd you manage to piss off a guy
          as powerful as Francis Boutillier?

                         SKIPPER
          It wasn't hard.

                         TYLER
          I used to helm a school ship.  A
          long time ago.

                         SKIPPER
          The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never
          lost a race while you were Skipper.

Tyler is taken aback by Skipper's knowledge.

                         TYLER
          That's right, we didn't.  I miss it
          sometimes.  But, there are other
          things a Skipper can do.

Tyler removes his glasses and studies Skipper.

                         TYLER
          The families... want your ticket.
          Turn it in, we forget the whole
          thing.  Everybody goes home.

                         SKIPPER
          ... Absolutely not.

                         TYLER
          The papers are going to eat you
          alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll
          never get another commission.
                  (beat)
          They want someone to be accountable.

                         SKIPPER
          I am accountable.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Standard fare.  Two beds and a T.V.  Chuck's lacing a new
pair of sneakers.  Charles is in the shower.  There is a
knock at the door.  Chuck cracks the door.  It's Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
          We gotta talk.


INT.  BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

The crew stand by the bulkhead.  Bill tosses down a
newspaper.  The headline reads:  INVESTIGATION TO PROBE
SCHOOL SHIP TRAGEDY.

                         BILL
          We're all going to have to testify.
          They're going to try to take his
          license.

                         TOM
          Why?

                         CHUCK
          They need it to be simple.  They
          need a reason.

                         TOM
          Who?

                         CHUCK
          All of them.  Everybody waiting on
          that dock.

                         TIM
          So what are we supposed to do?

                         TOD
          Just tell 'em what we know and be
          done with it.  That's what he'd
          want.

                         TERRY
          Easy for you to say.

                         TOD
          What's that supposed to mean?!

                         TERRY
          Everybody knows why she went over
          Tod.  You jibed the boat.

                         TOD
          I was trying to get her up wind!
          That's what you do when you're hit
          a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid
          to know that!

                         TERRY
          That's not what Skipper thought.  He
          was trying to spill air from the
          main!

                         BILL
          It was coming four points off the
          bow, Terry.  He never could have
          gotten her around.

                         TERRY
          Were you on deck?  I was standing
          right there and all I know is, he...
                  (indicates Tod)
          ... disobeyed an order, twice, and
          the boat went over.

                         TOD
          It didn't go over 'til I turned her
          starboard!

                         BILL
          It was an act of God for Christ's
          sake.

                         TERRY
          It was an act of stupidity.

Tod lunges at Terry.  Bill and Charlie pull them apart.

                         TOD
                  (screaming)
          Was it my fault we were running all
          that sail?!  Was it my fault she
          wasn't dogged down?!!  HUH?!!  I
          couldn't help that the ballast
          shifted...!  You son of a bitch!!
          It wasn't my fault!!  it wasn't.

Tod breaks down, sodding on his knees.

                         BILL
          It's okay, Tod.

Terry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt.

                         TERRY
          Then whose?

Tod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused.

                         TERRY
          After the lightning strike, we tried
          to go aloft to drop sail.  We'd done
          it a thousand times.  We didn't have
          to wait for an order.  But Skipper
          called us down.

                         CHARLIE
          If the foremast had taken a strike,
          everyone in the rigging would've
          been fried.  What would you have
          done?

                         TERRY
          We would have scalloped the squares
          from the deck.  Right Bill?

Bill turns and stares into the water, troubled.

                         TOD
          That's right, that's right!  Bleed
          the sails from the deck and she
          could've taken a hurricane!

It's a strong argument.  Even Charlie is troubled by the
implication.  There is a long moment of silence between
them.

                         CHUCK
          This is crazy.  Nothing could have
          prevented what happened.

                         MIKE
          You guys are missing the point.
          This is all because of Phil.  Phil
          and his dear old dad.

                         BILL
          What?

                         MIKE
          How do you think they got this
          together so fast?  He's been laying
          for Skipper since the first day.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on.  Like he's got a vendetta
          or some such shit?

                         MIKE
          You got it.
                  (to Chuck)
          I told you he was a turn coat the
          day we kicked him off the boat.

Chuck frowns, troubled.

                         CHUCK
          No.  You're wrong.

                         MIKE
          I'm telling you, the only way to
          change this is to get Phil to call
          off his old man.  And that ain't
          gonna happen.  So the way I see it,
          it's Skipper or us.

The guys react.  It's a no win situation.


EXT.  MOTEL - NIGHT

Chuck knocks quietly on the door.  Phil answers the door.

                         CHUCK
          Can we talk?

                         PHIL
          I guess.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Who is it Philip?

                         PHIL
          It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.
                  (to Chuck)
          Look, what do you want?

                         CHUCK
          Everybody's saying this whole
          tribunal is happening because of
          your father.  Because of you.

                         PHIL
          Well that's just typical isn't it?

                         CHUCK
          Is it true Phil?

                         PHIL
          I gotta go.

                         CHUCK
          You weren't there, you don't know
          what happened.

                         PHIL
                  (defensive)
          I know enough.

Chuck puts a hand out to stop him.

                         CHUCK
          Phil, please.  It won't change
          anything.  Tell him to call it off.

                         FRANCIS (O.S.)
          Who are you talking to out there
          Philip.  Come back in here.

Phil meets Chuck's eyes, then looks away.

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry.

He turns again and reaches for the door.

                         CHUCK
          Wait.

Chuck hands him something.  Phil looks down, disbelieving.
It's the ship's bell.  Robin's bell.  Their symbol of
unity, of putting loyalty above fear.

                         CHUCK
          We figured he'd have wanted you to
          have it.
                  (beat)
          You do what you've gotta do Phil.

He leaves Phil standing alone on the porch, full of
emotion, trying to grasp it all.


INT.  HEARING ROOM - DAY

A small courtroom.  The room is filled with the crew
members and their families, including the parents of the
victims, as well as the media.  Phil sits with his father
and dodges Chuck's eyes.  Coast Guard Officers Tyler,
DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings.

                         TYLER
          The United States Coast Guard has
          been asked to conduct this maritime
          hearing to consider the revocation
          of Captain Richard Sheldrake's U.S.
          Master Seaman's Certificate.


INT.  HEARING ROOM - LATER

Bill sits at the table with his parents as questions are
leveled at him.  Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing
ask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the
proceedings.

                         SANDERS
          Why didn't you drop any sail?

                         BILL
          Skipper called us out of the
          rigging.

                         SANDERS
          But your instinct was to lose sail?

                         BILL
          My instinct was to not get
          electrocuted.

                         SANDERS
          How old are you, son?

                         BILL
                  (hesitating)
          Fifteen.

                         SANDERS
          Thank you.

LATER

Phil is at the table with Francis.  Sanders asks the
questions.

                         SANDERS
          Philip, why were you discharged from
          the Albatross?

Phil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers.

                         PHIL
          Skipper thought I was a challenge to
          authority.

                         SANDERS
          Were you?

                         PHIL
          I don't know.

LATER

                         FRANCIS
          Captain Sheldrake exhibited an
          arrogant, controlling attitude in my
          presence on more than one occasion.
          I believe he had a personality
          conflict with my son from the start.

                         SANDERS
          Well, if you don't mind my asking,
          sir, why did you let your son stay?

Francis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly.

                         FRANCIS
          It was his dream to go.  I could
          hardly stand in the way of that,
          could I?

Phil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode.


INT.  HEARING ROOM - LATER

It is Skipper's turn at the table.

                         SANDERS
          Is it true that you forced Robin
          Weathers to climb the mast when it
          was clear that he was acrophobic.

                         SKIPPER
          He climbed when he was ready.

                         SANDERS
          Were you aware that his brother was
          killed in a fall.

Chuck and the others look up astonished.  Mike shoots a
look towards Phil.

                         MIKE
          He did it man.  He sang like a bird.

Skipper hesitates.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes, I was.

Whispers fill the room.

                         SANDERS
          Sir, were you aware at any time of
          the use of alcohol among the crew.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes, I was.

                         TYLER
          And you didn't do anything about it?

                         SKIPPER
                  (beat)
          No.  I didn't.

Again the crew members are struck.  Charlie turns to
Chuck.

                         CHARLIE
          They're twisting it all around.  Why
          doesn't he say something?

                         SANDERS
          Had you ever seen a "White Squall"
          before this incident?

                         SKIPPER
          No.

                         SANDERS
          What makes you so sure it was one?

                         SKIPPER
          I can't be sure.

                         SANDERS
          You really felt that your crew were
          up for the conditions.

                         SKIPPER
          We'd come twelve thousand miles
          together, through every kind of seas
          imaginable...

                         SANDERS
          Except, a "White Squall".
                  (beat)
          With all due respect Captain
          Sheldrake, they're only boys...

                         SKIPPER
          They are much more than that, sir.

                         SANDERS
          Is it true that the reason you
          expelled Philip Boutillier...

                         SKIPPER
                  (cutting him off)
          For killing a dolphin.

                         SANDERS
          ... and that you invited him to
          strike you?  To fight it out on the
          deck of your ship?!

Skipper looks over at Francis.  Phil stares at the floor.
Skipper manages an ironic smile.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes, that's true.

                         SANDERS
          Do you think this is funny?  Some
          kind of joke?  You lost six people
          out there.

                         SKIPPER
                  (white hot)
          I don't think one second of this is
          funny, sir.

Skipper stares down Sanders.  He turns to Tyler.

                         SANDERS
          I have no more questions at this
          time.

He turns to sit down, then stops.

                         SANDERS
          Oh, one last thing... Isn't true
          that your father was a sea Captain?

Skipper bristles.

                         SKIPPER
          Yes.

                         SANDERS
          Isn't also true that his vessel went
          down off of Nantucket?  Lost
          everyone on board.  In fair weather
          no less.

Skipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage.  Tyler
sees it and tries to intercept.

                         TYLER
          What does this have to do with
          anything Mr. Sanders?

                         SANDERS
                  (smug)
          Oh, nothing.  I was just curious.

                         SKIPPER
          My father, was more seaman, more of
          a man, than you might ever hope to
          be.

Sanders returns to his seat, rattled.  Tyler pounds his
gavel.

                         TYLER
          We'll take a brief recess.


EXT.  BUILDING - DAY

The crew huddle in the parking lot.  Fractured, confused.
Chuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves.

                         TOD
          There's still a way.

                         BILL
          What do you mean?

                         TOD
          It's me, don't you see.  Terry's
          right, I'm the escape hatch.  I
          disobeyed order.

                         CHUCK
          You taking the order wouldn't have
          changed anything.

                         TOD
          They don't know that.
                  (beat)
          We were the only one's on deck.
          Look, there's nothing they can do to
          me right?  I'm a kid.

                         CHUCK
          But that's not the point...

                         TOD
          That is the point... And Skipper'll
          slip off the hook.

LATER

Tod is on the stand.

                         DOWNING
          Why didn't you turn hard to port as
          the wind hit?

                         TOD
          I thought we'd have a better chance
          if I headed into the wind so we
          could spill air from our sails.

Tyler removes his glasses.

                         DOWNING
          But the Captain ordered you hard to
          starboard.

                         TOD
          Twice.

                         DOWNING
          Is that what you were trained to do?

                         TOD
          No.

                         DOWNING
          Then what do you think he was trying
          to do.

                         TOD
          Let the blow drive the boat down
          wind.  Neutralize our canvas.

Skipper is becoming uneasy.  He sees what is coming.

                         DOWNING
          So when the captain gave you an
          order contrary to your training, you
          thought he was making a mistake?

                         TOD
          No.

                         TYLER
          Then why son, why didn't you follow
          his order?

Tod meets Skipper's eyes.

                         TOD
          Because -- I panicked.

The room is suddenly buzzing.  Tod's Father stands up.

                         TOD'S FATHER
          That's not true Tod.

                         TERRY
                  (to Mike)
          What the hell?  What is he doing.

                         MIKE
          Son of a gun.  He just sent Skipper
          a life boat.

Tyler turns to Skipper.

                         TYLER
          If this young man had responded
          instantly to your command, do you
          believe the ship might have been
          spared?

                         SKIPPER
          I don't know that anything could
          have prevented what happened.

                         TYLER
          Then what are you trying to say
          then?

Skipper stands.

                         SKIPPER
          Maybe you can't see what's happening
          here, but it's clear to me.
                  (to Tod)
          I appreciate what you're trying to
          do Tod.  Maybe you could live with
          it, but I couldn't.
                  (to tribunal)
          If you think I'm going to let a
          sixteen year old take
          responsibility, then you
          underestimate me.  The Albatross was
          my ship.  The Ocean Academy was my
          school.  Her loss is mine and mine
          alone.
                  (to others)
          I can't bring your sons back.  If
          you want my ticket, if that will
          ease your loss, it's the least I
          can do.  This...

Skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.

                         SKIPPER
          This is easy.  Living with it,
          that'll be hard.

Skipper turns and lays his license down in front of Tyler.
Then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the
room.

The room erupts.  Crew members and their families hurl
accusations and blame.  Cameras flash.  Tyler tries to
regain control.  Suddenly Chuck stands, tall.

                         CHUCK
          No!!!  Don't you walk away!  Not
          now.  Not after all of this!!!!

Skipper keeps walking.  His head slumps.  Tyler pounds his
gavel.

                         TYLER
          That enough son!!  Order!!  Please!!

Tears begin to stream down Chuck's face.  His father,
Charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes.  Go for it.

                         CHUCK
          Tell me Skipper, was it all just a
          lie?  "Where we go one, we go all".
          We listened to you.  We believed it.
          And we're still here!!

Skipper keeps moving.

                         CHUCK
          Shame on you then Skipper.  Shame on
          you.

Skipper reaches for the door.  Suddenly a sound stops him
cold in his tracks.  Phil slowly rises.  Tears streaming
down his face.  Tightly in his hands he grips the ships
bell.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  It is the
ringing of the truth.  The tolling of their unity.

                         FRANCIS
          Sit down!

Phil ignores him.  Skipper slowly walks over, his eyes
never leaving Phil's.  He stops, facing him.  He gently
takes his hands and silences the bell.  Then he smiles and
puts a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his own
emotions.  He turns to Chuck.

                         CHUCK
          Tell them the truth.  Make them
          understand.

The room grows silent.

                         SKIPPER
                  (smiling)
          You tell them Chuck.

Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.

                         CHUCK
          It's simple.  Bad things happen
          sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or
          Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in
          this room.  Because we all knew the
          risks.
                  (to parents)
          You sent us... You paid our tuition,
          you allowed us to go.  So to invent
          a reason for why this happened, to
          pin it on one person, well that
          won't change anything.  It'll just
          make our experience meaningless.

He turns to the tribunal.

                         CHUCK
          If you want to judge this man, judge
          him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice
          and George.  Chris and John and
          Robin.  In one way or another each
          one of them gave their lives saving
          one of us.  This may sound crazy but
          the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or
          even a school.  It was something
          that we made, that's inside us.
          That's who Skipper is.  That's what
          he taught us.  I guess what it
          really was about was... the
          privilege of sacrifice.

Chuck turns to Skipper.

                         CHUCK
          Isn't that right?

Skipper nods.

                         SKIPPER
          That's right.

The room is silent.  Then, a voice.  A golden tenor
singing like the wind.  Everyone turns.  It's Bill.

                         BILL
          When the sun came up, there was
          whisky in the cup, and not a one of
          us was sober...

One by one the crew members stand and begin to sing.
Chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand
with him.  Words or not.

                         CREW TOGETHER
          Jenny thought she saw a picture when
          it really was the sun, then we knew
          the party was over.

They all stand facing Skipper and sing.  The voices build,
sweeping over everyone like a wave.

                         CREW TOGETHER
          Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you
          today, but I know we'll meet again,
          when the moon is in the valley and
          the leafs are on the trees, We will
          come to clearly in the glen...

Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates.  Only
now is his job finished.  He beams back.  The music swells
like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small
wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in
the calm waters beyond.

The crew come together around Skipper one last time.  They
embrace.


EXT.  MYSTIC SEAPORT - HARBOR - DAY

Older Chuck has returned to the small building where the
funeral services were held earlier.  The people have gone
but the funeral urn remains.


EXT.  PIER - DAY

Chuck walks to the dock.  He has the funeral urn in his
hands.  He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins
untying her.  The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out of
his office.

                         HARBOR MASTER
          What do you think you're doing.

He walks over to the dock.

                         HARBOR MASTER
          All right friend, out of the boat.

He tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the
sharp end of a gaffing hook.

                         OLDER CHUCK
                  (softly)
          Stand away.

He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means
business.  He backs off.  Chucks pushes away and raises
the sail.  The harbor master watches, perplexed as the
small boat moves off for open water.


EXT.  OPEN SEA - SUNSET

Bathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked
against the ivory sail.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          They didn't take his ticket that
          day.  But why he never returned to
          the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he
          hadn't been able to free himself
          from the anchor of grief that had
          driven him to his knees aboard the
          Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared
          for the solitude and isolation of
          command without his Alice.  Or maybe
          it was just that the waves that had
          spoken to him for so long, had grown
          silent.  Whatever it was, that
          thing, it had always troubled me.
          Because, fate offers up no reasons.
          And maybe that's what I have
          traveled these thirty four years to
          say.  Maybe that is all I really
          know... And, that one man cared.

Chuck turns to the sea and speaks.

                         OLDER CHUCK
          Rest easy old salt.  For together
          again, we'll sail.

With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at
the sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET

The same sunset, but from another time.  Four young men
walk along a deserted beach.  A small boat has beached and
rocks gently in the shallows.  The boys run up and look at
it.  On the stern are painted the words:  BRIGANTINE
ALBATROSS.

SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water,
the young men and the boat.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Some time later we learned that one
          of our long boats had been
          recovered.  Several young men found
          it washed up on a nameless beach
          somewhere on the island of
          Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know
          who they were or where they came
          from, but they seemed to know of the
          Albatross.
                  (pause)
          Sometimes in my dreams those
          faceless young men reveal themselves
          as my lost companions, and on the
          twilight coral sands of forever,
          between my slumber and conscious
          state, we race naked again, so open
          and in love with those precious
          moments, running, ever laughing,
          ever young, ever free.

EXT.  GALAPAGOS - DUSK

Young again, their hair sun bleached and skins brown,
Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod, pound through the
surf in a grinning footrace.  Brothers all.  Music builds.

          Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
          wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
          
          CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
          peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
          of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
          ice.
          
          STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
          crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat
          stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage
          beauty, then...
          
          THUD!!!
          
          A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather
          gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface
          with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
          out --
          
          -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
          It's a man.
          
          Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
          snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
          -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
          spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
          startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
          
          We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
          shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
          PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
          white.

          The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades
          us like a rhythmic lullaby.
          
          -- CU on WOMAN'S TOES digging up soft, white sand.    The
          shadow of a palm tree cascading over top.
          
          Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an
          ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly
          applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic
          calves. Deep. Soothing. Then --
          
          O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door.
          
          The hands stop.
          
          Another KNOCK KNOCK.
          
          The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt
          halt.

                       ...Yeah?
          
          Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants --
          rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but
          she's not at the beach.
          
          In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY
          OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's
          got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels
          above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm
          tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the
          earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.
          
          The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK
          (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel
          shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the
          intrusion.
          
                                     JAMIE
                       Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein
                       needs to see you in biology. Said
                       it's urgent.

                       Alright --
          
          Jamie leaves.
          
          As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her,
          panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes
          lay strewn about the floor.

          A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has
          been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN
          unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the
          space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical
          beach.
          
          A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized
          with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy-
          striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by
          international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing
          next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with
          SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his
          face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.

          We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the
          icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not
          enjoying the cold. She reaches a row of buildings and
          checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB #2...ASTROPHYSICS -

                    it all summer and they took it.

                    It was just budding, too.
          
          He sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy-
          eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato
          chips, candy bars, and drinking beer. Stifling laughter.

          Carrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh.

                    Professor Sapperstein, I'd like
                    you to read something for me.
          
          She pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her
          neck. Opens it up. Puts it in front of his face.

                    What's this say?

                    C'mon, go ahead, read it.

                    Very good.

                    Now are you still sure you want to
                    report the theft of an illegal
                    narcotic?
          
          He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie
          puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away
          from the others.

                     No, no, not crazy. But this time
                     of year, down here, we're all
                     going a little toasty aren't we?
                     How about you plant a little
                     Cannabis when you get home?
          
          She pats him on the back.
          
          
          INT.   MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY
          
          Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is
          about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --
          what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right
          temple.
          
          She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is
          bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.
          
          She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of
          empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:
          None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with
          "Theft of botany sample." And "None."
          
          A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.
          Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.
          Just stares unhappily at the binder.
          
          Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the
          cardboard tiles.
          
          She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a
          row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform
          graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other
          girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday
          cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere,
          sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

          CONTINUED:
          
          As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a
          nearby box --

                       You busy?
          
          She turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on
          the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       What do you think?

                       I know you weren't in the area.
                       What's up?
          
          He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to
          it.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he
                       spotted a popsicle out on the ice.
          
                                      CARRIE

                                      MURPHY
                       Don't know.

                       McClain Valley? What was he doing
                       out there? That's no man's land.
          
          He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems
          amused.
          
                                     MURPHY
                       I've got a plane heading to ASB in

          Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the
          base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen
          specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings
          raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular
          shaped walkways.
          
          Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow,
          pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE
          BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both
          sides of the runway.
          
          Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she
          deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the
          other side of the plane.
          
          The main ASB complex is before her.
          
          Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 DAYS
          TO WINTER-OVER EVAC. Piles of packed equipment are
          everywhere.
          
          Half a dozen NAKED MEN wearing only boots and face masks
          blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around
          the South Pole, right past her, and back into ASB.
          
          Carrie heads in --

          Music cranks. Carrie knows her way. People come and go
          as she strides along a corridor decorated with PARTY
          BALLOONS and signs that read: `DON'T FORGET THE EVE OF
          EVAC PARTY' -- comes to an office door with a small
          plaque on it that reads: MARSHAL. Pushes it open.
          
          
          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. It's smaller than her McMurdo office with
          a HOLDING ROOM that has a viewing window in the door. A
          fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer
          and lamp on top.
          
          A map of Antarctica is spread across a wall with sub-
          station positions marked in block letters. A window
          gives view to the South Pole.
          
          
          INT. SMALL ROOM - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie opens the door. Single bed. Tiny dresser. No
          frills. She tosses her gear bag onto the bed. Closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY
          
          Carrie pokes her head in. An examination table, cabinets
          with drugs and first aid equipment. A couple of hospital
          beds. Moving boxes are packed up.

          Another door in the back of the room is open, but the
          light is off. Carrie turns to leave and --

          outside, Aussie RUSSELL KELLER (late 20's) coming down
          the corridor. He's naked, except for a towel wrapped
          around his waste. Sports a goatee. Couple tats.
          Flashes a cocky smile.
          
                                   KELLER

                       It's his first year down here.
                       You know how that goes. My bet it
                       was just debris, an old tent or
                       something.

                       stay here with me and we'll party,

          A large room by base standards. Several windows. A
          giant map of ANTARCTICA dominates one wall with the
          International stations and research outposts flagged with
          pins that have their countries flags on them.   A grid of
          EVAC TIMES of each STATION and OUTPOST is next to it. A
          Tech is changing a few.
          
          Another TECH sits as a console, lined with comm equipment

                    I went to evac a camp. Had to fly
                    off route to get around a storm.
                    Got down low to avoid some
                    turbulence, and there it was.
          
          Carrie notices a picture of a young boy, around seven,
          wearing a Yankees cap dangling from the instrument panel.
          It's framed in popsicle sticks with I LOVE YOU DADDY
          written around the perimeter.
          
                                     CARRIE

          Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is
          broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses.

                       It's right up here.
          
          He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor.
          Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways --
          Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction.

          The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc
          and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder,
          weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small

                       the radio going on and on about
                       the Serengeti heat and his wife,

          The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death.
          
          They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the
          spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous.

          Carrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep

          Just as they pass OPERATIONS, Rhonda steps out with the

          Carrie returns with the water.   Goes to pour it on the
          zipper, but Doc gently puts his hand on hers, stopping
          her.

                       Let's ask ourselves if we really
                       need to do this.
          
          They share a moment, Carrie understanding, but --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Nobody wants to get out of here
                       more than I do, trust me, but
                       right now -- we're all this guy
                       has.
          
          She slides her hand away from his -- starts pouring the
          water on the zipper.

          Little by little, it starts to move -- then finally,
          ZIIIIIIIIIIP. The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced
          skin.
          
          Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but
          can't.

                       Grab that side.
          
          She takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull. The
          jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a
          frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding
          A DEEP PUNCTURE WOUND through the shirt.
          
          Doc's face sags.    Carrie stares at the wound.

          Carrie steps out into the hallway. Takes a moment,
          leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her
          more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The
          second it hits the wall --

          full of blood. A man is on the floor between two beds
          before her. She holds her gun at her side. He's dead.

          a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room.

          O.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her
          eyes. Knocks on the door. No one answers. Moaning
          continues. She doesn't have time for this. Opens the
          door to see --
          
          -- a large TV playing a locker-room porno where a

          an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one
          wall. A large map of Antarctica on another.

          Carrie walks in. Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another
          in her hand. Looks stressed. She's hovering over one of
          the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen
          displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler.
          His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading
          toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations
          are marked as well.

          doesn't like it.

          Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into

          WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp,
          slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her

          The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall
          of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim.
          
          CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in
          half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls
          across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.
          
          Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot
          tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to
          the side of the building.
          
          She steps into the storm.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking
          the wheel.
          
          Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is
          gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide
          line and the ROAR of the storm.
          
          A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by
          her tether and smacked down on the ice.
          
          Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally
          Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to
          realize she's at a building.
          
          She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening
          the door.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the
          HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are
          chattering.
          
          She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the
          ready room into the building.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a
          sliver of light stabbing in through a window.
          
                                  CARRIE
                         (calling out)
                    Mooney? Hello?
          
          Only silence responds.
          
          The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in
          both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket.
          Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark.
          
          Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from
          her belt. She decides to go left.
          
          Walking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one
          gives.
          
                                   CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Mooney?
          
          She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an
          empty room.
          
          Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like
          someone trying to clear their throat.
          
          Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a
          closed door at the end of the hall.
          
          It's confirmed when she hears it again.
          
          Stops at the door.
          
          She slowly opens it --
          
          Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING --
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                35.
          CONTINUED:
          
          -- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge
          type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned
          sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's
          coming from. Another cough.
          
          She enters the room.
          
          
          INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to
          see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood.
          Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his
          esophagus.
          
                                    CARRIE
                       ...My God.
          
          She goes to him. As she kneels, he grabs her, GASPING
          for air, trying to tell her something.
          
          Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his
          eyes -- someone's coming at her.
          
          -- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as --
          WHAM! An ICE AXE swings down at her. Just misses her
          head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the
          baton that goes clattering across the floor.
          
          The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes
          another swing. She lunges to the side. Axe misses her,
          but sinks into Mooney. Game over for him.
          
          Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the
          baton, but can't see it.
          
          The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts
          around the sofa, heading back out the door.
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run,
          retracing her steps. Her light zigzags. The killer
          emerges a few beats later on a run. It's going to be
          close.
          
          Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the
          Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's
          right behind.
          
          She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light
          getting smaller and smaller as she nears.
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets there.   Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all
          or nothing.   She pulls open the door --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          -- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed.
          
          SMACK!   The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.
          
          She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock
          on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the
          same time. It's a race.
          
          CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her
          hard.
          
          She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind
          her bursts open.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm
          line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing
          back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses
          sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.
          
          She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but
          HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.
          
          She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
          materializing out of the whiteout right behind her.    He's
          clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
          
          He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the
          ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,
          raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his
          knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
          
          He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.
          She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
          
          The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
          kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
          
          SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
          
          There is nothing but her strained BREATHING.   The killer
          draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood.   He swings.
          
          Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND
          grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer
          disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole.   Grabs
          on.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no
          idea which way to go.
          
          Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the
          blowing ice are signs pointing different directions:
          "Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles
          15,641"
          
          She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the
          wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her
          face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.
          
          Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat.
          A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.
          
          
          EXT. WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
          
          Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns
          to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She
          deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab
          the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking
          Carrie's glove with it.
          
          He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,
          throwing him off balance.
          
          The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the
          ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as
          Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a
          pendulum.
          
          The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes
          everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly
          struggles up the line.
          
          
          EXT/INT. STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS
          
          More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door
          and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
          
          Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around
          the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.

          CONTINUED:
          
          The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's
          caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.
          
          Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.
          
          Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout
          
                                                            SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)
          
          A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto
          Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself
          in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge
          dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The
          bathroom door behind her is open.
          
          She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the
          room behind her. Body tenses.
          
          As she turns --
          
                                      CARRIE
                       Jack?
          
          No answer.
          
          She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the
          door.
          
          Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM!
          Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the
          other door jam.
          
          Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven,
          grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the
          bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into
          the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She
          drops to the floor --
          
          CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her.
          She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a
          frenzy, like a cat in water.

                       Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay.
          
          The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding
          her down.

          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER
          
          She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old,
          WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand
          -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of
          water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the
          florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm.
          
                                        CARRIE

                       dead   guy in the other building --
                       that   Mooney?

                       Yeah. Someone got to him before I
                       did. Then went after me.

          Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her.
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                       He's been looking after you.
          
          He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth.

                       Thanks.
          
          As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in
          Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling
          something else.
          
          She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers
          are slow moving.

                                  DELFY
                    Whoever it was, could have flown
                    out after the storm broke.
          
          They walk a few silent beats, then --
          
                                     DELFY (cont'd)
                    Who's Jack?
          
          It's a moment before she responds --
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Let it go, Delfy.
          
          He lets it go.
          
          THEY ENTER THE LOUNGE
          
          Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa.
          Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the
          blood on the floor.
          
                                  DELFY
                    Until I met you, I hadn't seen any
                    dead people. Now I'm at two.
          
          Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa.
          Low angles her light. Something reflects.    Reaches in.
          Retrieves her baton --
          
          
          INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal
          vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which
          bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
          
          Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth
          - Shhhhh.
          
          She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but
          it hurts. She shifts it to the other.
          
          She turns off her light.    Delphy does the same.   Motions
          for him to stay put.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her
          back tight to the wall.
          
          Gets to the edge of the door.      It's open just slightly --
          looks in.
          
          Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her, holding
          a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag
          with his other. Items are strewn. Another bag has been
          completely turned inside out.
          
          She enters.    Baton cocked.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Unless you want your head cracked,
                       I wouldn't move.
          
          His body tenses.

                       Now turn around.
          
          He does. He's a guy in his 30's. Although he's clean
          shaven, there's a rugged edge about him.

                       the time constraints we're up
                       against, let's be honest, taping

                    If they've been digging out there,
                    that's a direct violation of the

          Carrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She

          stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it

          Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays over a litter of personal
          effects, then picks up a TRAIL OF BLOOD leading to a cot
          between two others. Someone is huddled in a yellow
          sleeping bag on it. Her body tightens.

          pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses
          her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't
          move. She pulls at it...
          
          ...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is
          soaked in blood.   No corpse.
          
          She steadies her breathing.      She pulls out a small baggie
          from her pocket.

          Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen
          blood sample from the pant leg. Puts it in the baggie.
          
          Takes out her camera next.       Starts snapping.   Flash goes
          off.

          Carrie enters with Delfy. Place is lit by a single dim
          bulb. This is a work space; two tables, instruments on
          top. Sample containers piled everywhere. Numerous
          photos of meteorites are stuck to a board.
          
          She finds Pryce reading the crew's DAILY LOG.

          Delfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT;
          it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower.
          A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box.

          FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front
          doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the
          entrance.
          
          Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations,
          watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by
          two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.
          
          She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the
          door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are

          Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal.    It's

          Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat.
          Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then,
          she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
          
          Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out.
          Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.

          She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now
          paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After
          a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth --
          like it's supposed to be.
          
          She turns around.   Tries to get the bigger picture.
          Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large
          area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
          inches thick --

                       they tries to spread the ice to
                       hide it.
          
          She heads back across the area.       Scans the horizon.
          Takes another step forward.
          
          WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below
          the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was
          covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
          
          Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
          slightly, unsure of their own footing.
          
          Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is
          precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
          slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece
          of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to
          hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but

                       Grab me!
          
          Pryce lays flat. Reaches his hand down -- six inches too
          short. Delfy appears from behind.
          
                                       PRYCE
                       (to Delfy)
                       Hold my legs!
          
          Delfy does.    Pryce inches closer.
          
                                       CARRIE
                       I'm slipping!

          He gets closer.   Closer.    Moves to within an inch from
          hers --
          
          -- She SLIPS.    Falls away.   Things become silent.
          
                                    PRYCE
                    Carrie?    Can you hear me?
          
          Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss.
          
                                  DELFY

                                  DELFY
                    Saw a rope in the Cat.
          
          Delfy springs to his feet.
          
          
          INT. ICE SHAFT - SAME
          
          Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall
          of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets
          to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.
          
          As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls
          on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.
          
          Carrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground beneath
          her is metal.
          
          
          INT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a
          rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits.
          Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
          
          Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens
          easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their
          lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE!
          
          
          INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice
          crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except
          for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they
          go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. Place is
          tomb silent.

          CONTINUED:
          Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at
          odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is
          pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.

                       Cargo plane, but I don't recognize
                       it.
          
                                     DELFY
                       It's an Antanov-74. Russian made -
                       - late fifties. No one's put
                       these in the air for forty years.
          
          Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness,
          heading for the cockpit.
          
          Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light -
          - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position -
          - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past
          the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man
          staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's
          dead, pinned between two large metal crates.
          
          Delfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a look back
          over her shoulder --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Guess that makes three.
          
          She continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her light
          targets the cockpit door. It's closed.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie pushes the door open.
          
          The beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED
          across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding
          through it.
          
          Continues over three dead men in flight suits still
          strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly
          expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm
          holstered around their waist.
          
                                     DELFY
                       This isn't funny --
          
          She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused.

          INT. CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb
          through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered
          cargo area.
          
          Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle
          of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of
          supplies.
          
          Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free,
          sniffs, and drinks.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    What is that?
          
          Delfy grins.

                    Vodka.
          
          Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM
          flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS
          TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.
          
          Spots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead.
          
          Moves to it.

                    Find what you're looking for?
          
          Her light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL
          CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And
          inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open.
          
          Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Just answers.

                    Those are fuel tanks behind you.

                    And by the looks of that safe,
                    must've been transporting
                    something pretty important.
          
          Carrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been
          breached.

          CONTINUED:
          Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this
          weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous
          intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools
          litter the floor.

                       They put some serious work into
                       this.
          
          There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where
          one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered
          in blood --

                       Whoever got hurt, they dragged him
                       out of here. There's blood all
                       over the tunnel.
          
          She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe
          more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX
          ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed.
          Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide.
          
          The PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES.

          CRASHCRASHCRASH!    More ICE.
          
          They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight
          beams swinging wildly about the hold.
          
          MORE ICE FALLS. It's getting louder as they're getting
          closer to the source.
          
          Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the
          hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely.
          Light fades.

          CHIPCHIPCHIP!    Ice is flying.
          
          Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped
          up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard
          at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled
          hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts
          are big-- but the progress minimal.

                    hours at the most.

                    this. No way.
          
          The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade.
          Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg,
          trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light
          goes out --
          
          -- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second
          later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it.

          Delfy looks to them both.    Desperate.

          Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible
          in the dissipating range of light.
          
          Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a
          pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her
          coat.
          
          Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it,
          but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks.
          Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
          
          Pryce comes back with a couple bottles.       Stops dead in
          his tracks.
          
          Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS
          attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.
          
          He moves to Carrie --

                       Hold these.
          
          He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight.
          
          He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the
          back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the
          dark.
          
                                     CARRIE

                    All these planes used to have bail-
                    out hatches.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    We came in through it.
          
          Pryce goes back into the cargo area.
          
                                  PRYCE (O.C.)
                    Has to be more than one.
          
                                  DELFY
                    It'd be on the ceiling in case of
                    an ocean landing.
          
          Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the
          cargo area of the aircraft.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Found it!
          
          Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam
          straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the
          fuselage.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    With the angle of the plane, I
                    don't think we're that far from
                    the surface. Give me a hand.
          
          Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over.
          They join, sliding it over below the hatch.
          
          He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    These are explosive bolts. If we
                    blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash
                    a hole up through the ice.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Or, if the ice is too thick the
                    blast will come right back at us.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    We can be blown up, suffocate or
                    freeze to death. Take your pick.
          
          Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch
          area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a
          crisscrossing maze of wires.

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a
          GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    This could work -- give me the
                    battery from your phone.
          
          As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over
          her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    When I connect these two wires,
                    hopefully there's going to be a
                    big bang. May want to take some
                    cover.
          
          Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire
          onto the battery, and prepares for another.
          
          He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against
          the fuselage.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    You guys ready?
          
          Delfy nods.
          
          Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her
          head.
          
          Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing
          happens. Hope freezes.
          
          Pryce tries again --
          
          -- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting
          around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet
          coming in and out of their light.
          
          SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on,
          halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's
          width.
          
          They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of
          ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a
          THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift
          from God.
          
                                    DELFY
                    Hallelujah --
          
          Pryce drops down.   Moves to another crate.

                    need to get up higher.
          
          Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it
          over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the
          other.
          
          Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing
          Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.
          
                                     CARRIE

                    What's going on?

          She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm
          from the shoulder holster.
          
          Switches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian
          gun in her coat pocket.

                    someone down here and Tahir
                    Soufian, a black market trader in
                    New York. It was all about
                    setting up a buy for cannisters
                    found in an old Russian transport
                    buried in the ice.

                    There's been rumors for years that
                    the Russians had a second base --
                    a secret weapons research facility
                    under the ice that supposedly blew
                    up in the late sixties -- nothing
                    was ever confirmed.

                    The fact is, before the treaty in
                    `72 they were strip mining all
                    over the place down here -- we
                    believe for uranium and other
                    specialized minerals for weapon's
                    use. It was the Cold War. No one
                    knows half the things the
                    Russian's were up to. This plane
                    could be the link between rumor
                    and truth. And if it is true,
                    what's in those cannisters could
                    be a prelude to another terrorist
                    attack.

          Carrie wrestles with her emotions. She looks back

          floor. Makes a decision.

          They look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky
          is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING.
          The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered.

                       He knows I'm on his ass, so he
                       might. Anything's possible. I
                       want to eliminate his options.
          
          She massages her gloved hand. Looks to Pryce who's
          talking on his PDA as he heads toward the Cat.

          Carrie strides along the corridor with Pryce. They pass
          a window where we see that an LC-13O EVAC PLANE is parked
          out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a
          massive beast. Move past several people, balloons and
          `Eve of Evac' signs.
          
          Pryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand, now.

          The gauze finally comes off, revealing her middle TWO

          Carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her.
          The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area
          where Doc works on her hand. She can't watch as his
          CURVED SUTURE and thread, rises and falls with every
          stitch he makes. Carrie has her attention on BLOODY

          longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the
          wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera...
          slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot.
          He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck.

          She's trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt,

          She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that
          sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying.
          
          Carrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears.
          
          After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway
          with some PAPERS in his hand. He's looking at her

                                  PRYCE
                    It's what the Russians used to
                    transport weapons grade materials
                    in. They match the dimensions
                    inside the safe. We're looking
                    for six of these.
          
          As Carrie studies them --

                    Langley's thinking it might be
                    Hexafluoride, which is a
                    derivative of Uranium. It's a
                    component for nuclear detonation.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    These beakers where really in over
                    their heads.
          
          The RADIO on Pryce's hip -- crackles...
          
                                  RHONDA (V.O.)
                    Dinkle, it's Rhonda --
          
          Pryce smirks.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    I better get this back to him.
                    And we have to find Rubin.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Think you can you help me with
                    these buttons, first?
          
                                   PRYCE
                    Sure.
          
          He moves closer.   Starts to button her up.
          
                                  PRYCE (cont'd)
                    For what it's worth -- I think
                    you're pretty tough, Marshall.

          INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window
          hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on
          the nearby wall --
          
          -- A HAND GRABS HERS --
          
          -- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's
          kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's
          embrace. A knife's brought to her neck.
          
                                      MAN
                            (raspy, deep)
                       ...You Stetko?
          
          Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket...
          
                                        MAN (cont'd)
                       Don't...
          
          She stops.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Who are you?
          
          He slowly turns her around to face him.
          
          -- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks
          slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin
          flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky,
          frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it
          together as he can barely get the words out...
          
                                     RUBIN
                       -- Did Mooney talk to you? I
                       didn't hear from him -- he was
                       supposed to call me after you
                       talked.
          
          Carrie's confused.
          
                                        CARRIE
                       Mooney's dead.
          
          His eyes well.
          
                                        RUBIN
                       No...
          
                                     CARRIE
                       And so's Weiss.

          He nods - he knew.
          
                                     RUBIN
                       And I'm next, I know it.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, you're safe, just put
                       the knife down.
          
          His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a
          little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf
          next to him.

                       cannisters?
          
          He stares off blankly --
          
                                     RUBIN
                       Weiss didn't want to go through
                       with it. Oh God. How did we let
                       this happen?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Rubin -- I need you to focus for
                       me.
          
          He tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes --
          he's trying.
          
          O.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door.
          
          Rubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged
          animal.
          
                                     DOC (O.C.)
                       Carrie, it's Doc -- got those
                       painkillers.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       It's okay, he's a doctor, he can
                       help you.
          
          It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She
          tries to stop him.
          
          Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair.
          She topples backwards.
          
          He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder
          into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back
          up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out
          of him. Pills all over the floor.

          Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort.
          
          Carrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin
          disappearing down a set of side stairs.

          Doc nods.
          
          She takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip.
          
          AT THE STAIRS
          
          She takes two at a time -- keys the two-way...

          BOTTOM OF STAIRS - LEVEL ONE
          
          As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's
          three guys carrying boxes out of a room. Snaps a look to
          the right --
          
          -- Rubin's at the far end, slipping through a doorway
          that leads into an INTERCONNECTING TUNNEL to another part
          of ASB.

          Rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as
          Carrie enters. It's lined with several free standing,
          empty bookcases.

          Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway.
          Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet.
          Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for
          the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --
          
          -- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM.   A sign above reads: READY
          ROOM.
          
          She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab
          stations to get to the door.
          
          
          OTHER SIDE OF ROOM
          
          Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't
          open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window --
          sees --
          
          -- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing ECW gear off a rack
          mounted to the wall.
          
          A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS: -60.
          
          He and Carrie exchange glances.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Rubin -- I can help you!
          
          He shakes his head.
          
          She tugs harder on the doors. Stuck. Looks through the
          window to see he's tied them together with some climbing
          rope.
          
          In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods
          half the room as the outside door is whipped open.
          
          A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway. He's wearing
          a FACE MASK and GOGGLES. Holds an ICE AXE poised, ready
          to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her.

          Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and
          Carrie, but --
          
          -- SWOOOSH! THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder,
          gaffing him like a fish. The pain's excruciating for
          Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man.
          BULLDOZES into him, driving him back out the door.
          
          Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end
          of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on
          the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder.

          Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off.
          Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria.
          Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy
          can get to his feet.
          
          His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to
          retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so
          tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.

          Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER. Turns to see it's Pryce.

          Pryce latches on to a heavy SUPPLY CART filled with
          beakers, micro-scopes and other gear, that's tucked
          against one of the lab stations.

                       Someone's trying to kill him.
          
          Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door. Hits it
          like a freight train, busting it open! Cart goes
          crashing. Contents scatter like buckshot.
          
          
          INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through

                       on.
          
          Carrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes
          for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie
          joins. Same thing.

                                     CARRIE
                       Thirty seconds.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins
          tucked against the base of the main building. The blood
          from his wound already frozen on his shirt.
          
          The cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's
          reflection off the ice is blinding.
          
                                                             CUT TO:
          
          
          RUBIN'S POV -
          
          -- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are
          literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to
          shield them -- has little effect.
          
          He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his
          attacker not far behind.
          
          Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his
          fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms
          are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care --
          pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins
          around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.
          
          Continues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under
          ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal
          his movement.
          
                                                                   81.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues
          toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the
          other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing
          filling an insulated container with water from an
          insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is
          parked next to them.
          
          He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice
          escapes...
          
                                   RUBIN
                    ...Help me.
          
          The guys -- oblivious.
          
          
          EXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY
          
          Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room
          and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite
          directions around the complex.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME
          
          Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get
          to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the
          container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too
          slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.
          
                                   RUBIN
                    W..wa..wait.
          
          He turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet
          away and closing.
          
          Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --
          anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER.
          Heads for it.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME
          
          Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where
          several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --
          through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
          RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the
          main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME
          
          Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support
          leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin.
          Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it,
          but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a
          defeated glance over his shoulder to see --
          
          -- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin
          against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on -
          - SPRAYING him head to toe.
          
          Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips
          go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff
          steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his
          ice-locked clothing.
          
          The man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP -
          breaks his neck.
          
          Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.
          
          
          INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME
          
          Rhonda crosses the busy room. Reaches for a clipboard
          hanging next to the window. Something outside catches
          her attention.
          
                                    RHONDA
                    Sam!
          
          She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.
          
          Murphy and the others join her at the window. They see
          Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view
          of the killer.
          
                                                        SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
          
          The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --
          
          -- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head.
          Goggles shatter.

          CONTINUED:
          
          He drops.
          
          Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps
          the goggle from his face.
          
          It's KELLER!
          
          Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.
          
          The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of
          him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine
          blade.
          
          Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck
          askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering
          from the impact --
          
                                     KELLER
                       I sh... sh... shoulda killed you
                       at Vostok.

                       Where are the cannisters?
          
                                       KELLER
                       Go to hell.

                       Help me drag him over here.
          
          They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him
          back over to the Snow Melter.
          
                                     CARRIE (cont'd)
                       Keep him still.
          
          She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's
          neck.
          
          Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then
          whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold
          makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
          
                                     PRYCE
                       Who's Tahir selling it to --
                       what's the intended target?
          
          Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her
          knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing
          bare arms and legs.

                    bitch?
          
          Keller instantly starts to shake.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Why did you kill those scientists,
                    Keller? Was a four-way split too
                    much for you?
          
                                    KELLER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.
          
          She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him
          with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground
          as it freezes instantly.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Where is the uranium?
          
                                  KELLER
                         (almost smug)
                    You have no idea what's going on
                    here, do you?
          
          Keller begins to shiver violently.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    Hit the sonofabitch again!
          
          Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.        He
          screams. Pain is too much. He caves.
          
                                  KELLER
                    The plane, they're in the fucking
                    plane.
          
          Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.     It's Murphy.
          Furious. Two other guys at his side.
          
                                  MURPHY
                    Have you completely lost your

                    Let go of me.
          
          She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)

                    What the hell's going on?
          
          She glares at him.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    The cannisters are on the plane.
          
          She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Throw him in the holding cell.
          
          The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the
          ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller
          screams.
          
          The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away.
          
          Murphy looks to Pryce --

                    Name's Pryce.
          
          Pryce looks at Carrie.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's with the UN. We have to
                    search that plane now!
          
          Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --
          
                                  MURPHY
                    We don't have time. We'll just
                    search it in Christchurch when it
                    lands.
          
          Pryce steps in --
          
                                  PRYCE
                    It's a twelve hour flight to
                    Christchurch. Anything can happen
                    in that time. Keller is here, so
                    we know it's still on the ground.

          Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of

          tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.

          Carrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off.
          
                                     PRYCE (cont'd)
                       You check the cockpit?
          
                                     CARRIE
                       Nothing. That bastard.
                       What the hell are you up to,
                       Keller?
          
                                     PRYCE
                       I don't get it, why lie to us --
                       we have him either way. He's
                       stuck here.
          
          Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that --
          
                                     CARRIE
                       He's buying time.
          
          Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace.
          
                                                               87.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which
          is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the
          evac. Pryce is close behind.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    Out of the way!
          
          
          INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie enters. Pryce at her side. Her face goes white.
          The door to the holding room is wide open. Keller's
          GONE.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Shit!
          
                                  PRYCE
                    He's got nowhere to go, nowhere to
                    hide.
          
          Then it hits her --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    He won't try.    He's a goddamn
                    pilot.
          
          As the two of them take off for the door --
          
          
          INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY
          
          Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit.
          Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined
          up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He
          heads toward an Otter.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY
          
          Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is
          still hanging on the console. Then, something catches
          his attention through the windshield of his plane. He
          sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's
          pumping.
          
          Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the
          hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane.
          Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a
          another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer.
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Gets to the plane.   Takes a look inside, and --
          
          THUD!   He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the
          head.   Stumbles back.
          
          Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.
          
          Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool
          chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap.
          Unconscious.
          
          
          EXT. ASB - HEADING TOWARD THE HANGAR - RIGHT AFTER
          
          Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way
          toward the hangar.
          
          
          INT. LC-130 - SAME
          
          Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into
          the plane. Get checked off a list by the LOAD MASTER.
          Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat.
          Plane is nearly full.
          
          
          INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER
          
          Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the
          console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees
          Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn.
          
          
          CARRIE AND PRYCE
          
          Shift their attention to the plane.    Blades turning. They
          stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully.      Eyeing for any
          betrayal of movement.
          
          Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast.
          Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a
          duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions
          for him to go one way, she'll go another.
          
          INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE
          Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open.
          She heads for it. Gun poised.
          
          Pryce moves to check the next plane.    Eyes dart to every
          dark corner.
          
          Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door.
          Inside's empty.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots
          Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks
          like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --
          
          SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in
          his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying.
          Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers.
          Keller kicks him hard.
          
          Pryce goes down.   Keller grabs the gun.
          
          Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --
          
          BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover
          behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder.
          
          Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires
          continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots
          go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right
          hand.
          
          Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots
          back, which --
          
          -- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover
          beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick.
          
          Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST.
          They stop. Carrie has to reload.
          
          Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for
          his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button
          attached to it. Slams it.
          
          HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN
          
          The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter
          is let inside.
          
          Keller keeps shooting.   Runs out of bullets.   Leaps into
          the idling Otter.
          
          Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.
          
          Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate --
          glass is too thick -- protection from the cold.
          
          Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward
          toward the opening doors.
          
          Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet.
          Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual
          once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce.
          He's bleeding profusely.
          
          She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of
          his chest.
          
          Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    ...I didn't see him.
          
          His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face --
          
                                    CARRIE
                    No!    You stay awake!
          
          Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure.
          Blood continues to ooze.
          
          She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the
          hangar.
          
          Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding.
          
                                  CARRIE (cont'd)
                    Damn it!
                         (to Delfy)
                    Come on. We're getting him up.
          
          They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the
          hangar the best they can. Go outside.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the
          ground.
          
          Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the
          bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.
          
                                    CARRIE
                    Press here.    Hard. Hard or he
                    will die!
          
                                     DELFY
                    It won't stop!
          
          Looks Delfy right in the eye.
          
                                  CARRIE
                    He's not going to be number four!

          Pryce moans.
          
          Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.
          
          Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it
          around him. Keeps repeating the motion.
          
          She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane
          moving toward the runway.
          
          The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake.
          
                                     PRYCE
                            (GASPING)
                       What are you doing?   Get Keller.
          
          She holds him down.

                       You're bleeding out. Freezing

                       You hold on.
          
          Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick
          draw. Keys it.

                       cannisters.

          On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles.
          Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on
          one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood
          starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles
          up, then guns it.
          
          Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across
          the cement floor and out the hangar.
          
          
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of
          the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the
          wind.
          
          Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.    Hits her
          light as she races in.

          Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his

          as she blows right by them.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto
          the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he
          gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads
          down his strip of freedom.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          CONTINUED:
          
          She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of
          the berms and onto the runway.   Heads straight for the
          lights of Keller's plane.
          
          
          INSIDE KELLER'S PLANE
          
          He sees Carrie.
          
                                      KELLER
                       Crazy bitch.
          
          INTERCUT:
          
          She targets him like a Japanese zero.       Hundred yards and
          closing.
          
          He's pushing to get airborne.        Seventy-five yards between
          them.
          
          Gap narrows fast.    Fifty yards.
          
          Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly
          swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --
          
          INSIDE WITH KELLER
          
          He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get
          airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is
          Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue
          right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she
          tumbles down the berm.
          
          Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at
          him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.
          
                                                             SMASH CUT TO
          
          
          CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT
          
          Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches
          the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel
          of disaster as it veers off the runway and --
          
          -- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!
          
          Resume -
          
          Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting
          off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold
          and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
          
          AT THE WRECKAGE

          CONTINUED:
          
          Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on
          the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit.
          The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
          
          Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller.
          In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.
          
          Reaches in through a broken window.       Pulls it out to the
          runway.
          
          Unzips it.    Is confused.    No cannisters.   Only survival
          gear.

          Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce
          in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the
          BODYBAGS onto a cart.
          
                                       MURPHY
                       Doc!
          
          Doc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two
          follow. Curious.
          
          Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's
          face, ashen.

                       Get him on the table!
          
          They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has
          his hand on Pryce's wound.

          Doc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys --

                       You, four units O-pos in the
                       warmer. Second shelf, fridge.
          
          The guy heads for it.
          
          Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks
          when she sees Pryce.

          Doc leans over Pryce's pale form.        Examines.
          
          As Doc gets an IV going, he looks to Carrie --

                       What happened?

                       Keller hit him with an ice axe.

          Rhonda's standing up front with the pilot and Copilot,
          watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming
          at them like a tidal wave. Brings a walkie to her
          lips...

                                     MURPHY
                       Can you do this on the plane?
                       It's your call, but I need to know
                       now.
          
          Doc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to
          Carrie -- she sees the answer's no.

                       I'm sorry.

          The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men
          are just   about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the
          storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the
          second.    He realizes they might not make it.
          
          
          EXT. RUNWAY - ASB - RIGHT AFTER
          
          The LC-130's jet engines roars as he gains speed down the
          runway -- faster and faster, then it suddenly gets
          swallowed in the storm -- like an avalanche covering a
          skier.
          
          Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere
          in sight, until --
          
          The LC-130 finally pushes out the front of it --
          AIRBORNE. Takes off into the horizon, where we see that
          the sun is just about to set.

          Carrie is standing next to Pryce on the examination
          table. He's been bandaged up. Eyes closed. Looks
          thrashed. An IV drip hangs from a stand on wheels.
          
          She's looking at him with soft, caring eyes -- been
          through a lot. He slowly opens his. Tries to smile, not
          easy.
          
                                   PRYCE

                                   CARRIE
                    Hey back.
          
                                   PRYCE
                    You get him?
          
                                   CARRIE
                    Um-hm.

          She shakes her head --
          
                                   CARRIE
                    Nope.
          
          They both think on it for a moment.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    What did we miss? Think Keller
                    cut and run without the stuff?
          
                                  CARRIE
                    After all this, no way. Keller
                    didn't have it on the plane
                    because he's got it hidden
                    somewhere.
                     (BEAT)
                    Where would he hide something for
                    six months. Somewhere he could be
                    sure no one would ever look.
          
                                  PRYCE
                    If he had made it out, he wouldn't
                    have been crazy enough to come
                    back for it.

          A SQUEAKY NOISE in the back of the room draws their

          She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something
          disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG
          pressing against the bag. Although the plastic is
          clouded, she'd swear his LEFT CALF has a LONG LINE OF
          STITCHES running down the side.

          Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where
          she chased Rubin.
          
          Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining
          daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run
          along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black.
          WINTER HAS SET IN.
          
          She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers
          through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her.
          
          Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay
          tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the
          door.
          
          She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end.
          Disappears into the science building.
          
          
          INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab
          stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room.
          Heads for the freezer.
          
          
          INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carrie opens the door.    Illuminates the interior with her
          light.

          CONTINUED:
          Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three
          walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney,
          Rubin, Weiss and Keller.
          
          Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to
          unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a
          plastic cinch.
          
          Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth
          as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag.
          
          Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She
          rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her
          like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center
          stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep
          gash tight together.
          
          She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself.
          Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc
          lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on
          the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of
          Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's
          run out from under his armpit.
          
                                     CARRIE
                       (to herself)
                       Someplace no one would ever think
                       to look.
          
          She raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches.
          
          She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM
          OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She
          reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the
          bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE
          CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like
          THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.
          
          She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her
          hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily.
          Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's
          frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT
          LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until
          she shines her light on it --
          
          The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core
          sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the
          other two bodies.
          
          She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more
          cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same
          thing.
          
          Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.

          Pryce used to bust open the door.

                    at least 5 million in diamonds in

                    nice life back in the world. How
                    many times have we both talked
                    about having a fresh start. Well,
                    this is it. Those beakers finding
                    that plane was a sign. A sign

          Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who

And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

								CUT TO:


2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

								CUT TO:


3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

								CUT TO:


4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

				OLD WOMAN
		Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?

				OLD MAN
		Who the hell knows.  What you have
		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 
		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
		out ... doctor said.  What you 
		tryin to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

								CUT TO:


5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

								CUT TO:


6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

				MARIETTA
		Hello...  Who is this?...

								CUT TO:


7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

				SAILOR
			(into phone)
		...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
		to Lula?

								CUT TO:


6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Theres no way in hell you can speak
		to her and...

								CUT TO:


7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

				SAILOR
			(feeling a smile coming on)
		What?...

								CUT TO:


6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever 
		call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettas twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

				LULA
		Mama???

				MARIETTA
		You know who it was and you know 
		you arent, and I mean ARE NOT 
		gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

				LULA
			(quietly)
		Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

								CUT TO:


8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAS ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

								CUT TO:


9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a 
bang.

								CUT TO:


10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

				TEENAGERS
		EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

								CUT TO:


11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom 
into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not 
		that singer.

				LULA
		Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

				BEANY
		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and
		beer guts aint quite my type.

				LULA
		          (giggles)
		Seeins how youre about as thick as
		a used string of unwaxed dental floss,
		dont know how you can criticize.

				BEANY
		Yeah, well, if he says that all that
		flab turns into dick at midnight, 
		hes a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and
		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mamas hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know 
		exactly where they are.

				BEANY
		I didnt hate me so much, Id feel
		better wishin you luck.

				LULA
		Cant all husbands be perfect, and
		your Elmo probly wouldnta ever 
		got that second one pregnant, you
		hadnt kicked his ass out.

				BEANY
		So youre gonna be needin the 
		blue-bird pretty soon?

				LULA
		Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap 
		tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

								CUT TO:


12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY

Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO:


13. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the 
course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears.

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.


13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - DAY

Feet (Lulas) was across carpet.

A closet door opens.

A hand (Lulas) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers 
closet.  The hand comes out clutching car keys.


13B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY

Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

								CUT TO:

The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro 
out and away.  The garage door closes automatically.

								CUT TO:


15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and 
disappears.

								CUT TO:


16. INT. BEANY THORNS GARAGE - DAY

Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beanys 
67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Birds 
front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

DISSOLVE TO:


17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 
house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 
calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 
comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

								CUT TO:


18. INT. SOUTHERN TIME BAR - DAY

Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

				MARIETTA
		Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office.

				BARTENDER
		Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(slightly hysterical)
		Well I gotta find him - right this
		minute!

								CUT TO:


19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 
out a cloud of dust.  Theyre both smiling.

				LULA
		Hey baby...

				SAILOR
		Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

				SAILOR
		Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    
		baby...  Did I ever tell you that
		this here jacket for me is a symbol
		of my individuality and my belief
		in personal freedom?

				LULA
		Bout fifty thousand times.  I got 
		us a room at the Cape Fear, and 
		guess what?...  I hear Powermads 
		at The Hurricane.

				SAILOR
			(smiling)
		Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

								CUT TO:


20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 
fan creak.

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethin like
		about the wicked witch of the east
		comin flyin in?...  Did you ever
		think somethin and then later think
		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is Gods own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole em from her beginnin in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokin when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.
		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR
		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin the old paint off our
		house without usin a mask...  But
		I dont know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

								CUT TO:


21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 
cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 
through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 
kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

				CLYDE
		FUCKIN BITCH!!!!

								CUT TO:


22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lulas eyes look off, remembering.

				LULA
		Finally in the middle of the one 
		night, with me and mama asleep 
		upstairs ... he poured kerosene over
		himself and lit a match.

								CUT TO:


23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 
livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 
behind him burst in flames.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Near burned down the house.  We 
		got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

								CUT TO:


24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

CU the red hot ash of Lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 
exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

				LULA
		It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

				SAILOR
		You have such a pretty, long neck, 
		like a swan.

				LULA
		Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth
		white neck.  It was like on a 
		statue it was so white?

Sailor drifts his thumb over Lulas left nipple then cups her breast in 
his hand.  They kiss.

								CUT TO:


25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.

				MARIETTA
		I knew this would happen.  Soon as
		that piece of filth got out of 
		Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble.
		Hes just got some kind of influence
		over her I cant decipher.  Theres 
		somethin wild in Lula I dont know
		where it comes from.  You gotta find
		em, Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with
		him of her own volition - willingly,
		that is - there aint much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 
		its leakin all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  Youd only be defendin 
		yourself, and with his record, 
		nobodyd fuss.

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill
		give him a talkin to and try to
		convince her to come back with me.
		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA
		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want
		to help me stop this thing.  Ill
		call Marcello Santos.

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.
		And dont be gettin carried away.
		You dont want to be bringin Santos
		and his people into it.

				MARIETTA
		Youre just jealous of Santos cause
		hes sweet on me.

				JOHNNIE
		Darlin, you aint seein Santos 
		again, are ya?

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you 
		trust your very own Marietta?

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love 
		with you like I am brings out that 
		ugly jealous side.

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryin about me and 
		start worryin about how youre 
		gonna get that Lula back here and 
		away from that murderer.

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And fars I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
		to that involvin Lula.  Even there
		he was protectin her.  You oughta
		be thankin him for that.  That Bob
		Ray Lemon they say was comin after
		the both of em.  Why am I tellin
		you this, you was around that night.
		You ought to know just exactly what
		happened.  Sailor just got a little
		too forceful is all...  You remember
		that night...

CU of Marietta eyes as she thinks back.

								CUT TO:


26. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom.  
Dance band music can be heard in the distance.  Sailor appears coming up 
the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet 
outside the MENS ROOM.

Mariettas POV of Sailor entering the MENS ROOM.

CU of Mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face.

Mariettas POV of walking toward MENS ROOM.

								CUT TO:


27. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I was there, but I didnt see 
		anythin.  All I knows that trash
		killed a man with his bare hands.
		Hands which are now probly all
		over my baby!

				JOHNNIE
		Marietta, settle down now darlin...
		I want whats best for her, too -
		Like I said, Ill do what I can to
		bring her home.

								CUT TO:


28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon Id be
		startin to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddys?  And my mama
		never knew nothin about me and 
		him - thats for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moren
		a little.

				SAILOR
		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I cant hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how
		old Pooch done the deed.

				LULA
		Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin
		her hair dyed?  And I was alone in 
		the house.

								CUT TO:


29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Uncle Pooch came in the side door
		through the porch, you know?  Where
		I was makin a jelly and banana
		sandwich?  I remember I had my hair
		in curlers cause I was goin that
		night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the
		DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have
		known nobody but me was home, cause 
		he came right in and put both his
		hands on my butt and sorta shoved me
		up against the counter.

								CUT TO:


30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		Didnt he say somethin?

Lula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and 
throws it into the toilet.

ECU of cigarette in toilet.

				LULA
		Not really.  Least not so I recall now.

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls 
down the hole.

ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls.

				SAILOR
		So howd he finally nail you?  Right 
		there in the kitchen?  

				LULA
		No, he picked me up.

								CUT TO:


31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDS ROOM - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		He was short but powerful.  With 
		hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me 
		into the maids dayroom which nobody
		used.  We did it there on an old bed.

								CUT TO:


32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt
		he force you?

				LULA
		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess theres all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makin my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
		strange or different after.  And he
		never did anything else to me.  I
		always got a nice present from him
		at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
			(pause)

								CUT TO:


33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up 
and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and 
grinding metal.

								CUT TO:


34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				LULA
		Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three
		years later while he was holidayin
		in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way
		too much traffic there for my taste...
		And another thing, baby...  That
		government of ours should be keepin
		us separated from outer space...

				SAILOR
		Here she goes again...

				LULA
		Sailor, that ozone layer is
		disappearin.  Seems to me the 
		government could do somethin about
		it.  One of these mornings the
		sunll come up and burn a hole clean
		through the planet like an X-Ray.

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		That aint never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womans laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethin like that...
		somewhere before...  Soundd like 
		the wicked witch...

				SAILOR
		Just sounded like an old gal havin
		a good time to me...  You ready to
		dance?

				LULA
		Im always ready to dance.  But I
		need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?

Lula and Sailor kiss.  In the middle of the kiss, the womans 
creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap 
open with a kind of fear.

35. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in 
her backyard.

				SANTOS
		I knew youd want it again...

		Thats not why I called.

				SANTOS
		Oh yeah - sure ... okay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  It isnt.

				SANTOS
		Have it your way...  But you want it.

				MARIETTA
		Lulas gone off with Sailor.

				SANTOS
		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA
		I want you to take care of Sailor, so
		he wont ever be able to bother my
		baby again.


				SANTOS
		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		Whats with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I dont 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and Im telling
		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a
		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on
		playin this stupid game?

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA
		I dont need to explain anymoren I
		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS
		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA
		All right...  I want you ... to ...
		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS
		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA
		Thats your business...  I dont care
		how.

				SANTOS
		Like an accident where maybe Lula
		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA
		NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS
		Well, like kill him with the atomic
		bomb?

				MARIETTA
		Santos...

				SANTOS
		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA
		Shoot him.

				SANTOS
		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA
		No.

				SANTOS
		Where?

				MARIETTA
		In the head.

				SANTOS
		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 
		gun...  Now Im beginning to get 
		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor
		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the
		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA
		No...  In the brains...  What little
		Im sure he has.

				SANTOS
		You want me to shoot Sailor in the
		brains with a gun.  

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Through the forehead?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Wrong!  Its much better to blow a
		hole in the back of the head ... 
		right toward the bridge of the nose
		...  Lots and lots of irreparable
		damage.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under 
		control.

				SANTOS
		Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...
		Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that
		town.

				SANTOS
		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS
		You give me your permission to kill
		Johnnie Farragut.

				MARIETTA
			(whisper)
		Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

				SANTOS
		Youre not tellin me that youre 
		sweet on him?

				MARIETTA
		No...  But...

				SANTOS
		One day hes gonna find out what 
		were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and
		he could cause us a lot of trouble.

They stare at each other for a moment.

				SANTOS
		Im gonna take your silence as a 
		yes...

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  I cant...


				SANTOS
		Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I
		either take you or that pretty 
		daughter of yours to bed.

				MARIETTA
		You fucker, dont you ever touch 
		Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

				SANTOS
			(laughing)
		Put your shoulders back.

				MARIETTA
		What?

				SANTOS
		Put your shoulders back, I said.

Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of 
her.

				SANTOS
		You got nice tits.

				MARIETTA
		Someones gonna see us.

				SANTOS
			(smiling as he starts
			to feel her breasts)
		Thats just another part of the price
		to pay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  You kill that Sailor, 
		otherwise hes gonna turn my baby
		against me.

Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up 
towards his.

				SANTOS
		Look at me...  Theres no turning back   
		on this...  Im gonna kill Sailor...
		Thats for sure.

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me its a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR

		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR
		     (helping him up)
		Im sorry to do this to ya here 
		in front of a crowd, but I want ya
		to stand up and make a nice apology

				IDIOT PUNK

		Im sorry.

				LULA
		Hell, you just rubbed up against

				SAILOR
		Thats good...  Now go get yourself

		You fellas have alotta the same power

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The

				SAILOR
		We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee,

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

				LULA
		Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some

		Twenty-three months, eighteen days is

				LULA
		Oh, you know exactly what I mean,

				SAILOR
		At Pee Dee, all you think about is

		And what youll do and what youll
		think about when youre on the

				LULA
		I just think about things as they

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN

		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		Yall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		Id just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if its
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
send.

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my

			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wants ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I aint got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.

		Muchas gracias.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and

the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you

		Certainly not.  We are here only

				DROP SHADOW

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in

		If a liberal, a socialist, and a

				LULA
		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination

				GEORGE
		No, maam.  I was a housepainter,

		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five

		Well, I aint upset about it, darlin.

Lula lifts her head and kisses Sailor under his left ear.  She rolls 
over on top of Sailor.

				LULA

				JOHNNIE
		Real good, Chet...  Its been awhile.

				JOHNNIE
		No...  Shes fine.  Back home.

				JOHNNIE
		Set one up.

Chet brings him a double.

				CHET
		So who you out sleuthin for now?...

				JOHNNIE
		Actually, Im lookin for Mariettas

				CHET
		Hell, that rings a bell.  Someone

				JOHNNIE
		Sounds right...  Ill check it out.

				CHET

		You hitched yet?

				JOHNNIE
		No sir...

				CHET
		Its none of my business, but when

				JOHNNIE
		Not for lack of love, I can tell

				CHET
		Thats what I mean...  Always looked

		Ill tell ya though, its comin up

Lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel.  In the back of the 
lobby in the shadows is an ancient, old BLACK MAN who stares at her.  
Sailor pulls the T-Bird up in front of the hotel and Lula hurries out to 
him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat.

				LULA
		Lets get outta here...  I suddenly
		got a funny feelin about this

				SAILOR

		Gotta hex from a voodoo?

They laugh and take off around the corner and up past the Cafe Du Monde.

94. INT. THUNDERBIRD

Lula and Sailor are motoring along.

				SAILOR
		Sweetheart, keep your panties up.
		Were in Jimmy Swaggart country.

Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He 
slows to pick him up.

				LULA
		Sure you wanna do this?  Might be 
		a way they could track us.

				SAILOR
		Hes just a regular guyt needs help,
		honey.  Look at him.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is 
carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

				ROACH
		Thanks a lot.  I been standin out
		there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!
		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchin on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My names Sailor, and this heres
		Lula.  Whats yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		Aint laughin, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guys crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I aint never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, 
		ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im
		gonna feed these boys good so theyll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  Youd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you dont mind my sayin so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookin after yourself, startin with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You dont feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youre thinkin that I got
		moren some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippin hunk

		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes

coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		ones intelligence...  Others may use

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE
		Hasta siempre.

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that

				JOHNNIE

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		Thats a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for

		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she aint talked to nobody

		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we bein strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we dont
		want to make nothin of nothin.

				LULA
		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face aint
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin
		botherin you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkin about her.
		Shes probly worried to death by now.

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		Cant you read?

Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr. Reindeer is dining with TWELVE 
GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a 
STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over 
very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

		Just some guys I met here...  I

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before 
turning back to Johnnie.  She also feels the fear.

and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls

dark figure follows out the window.

				MARIETTA
		I dont understand this...  I dont

		Perhaps we should call a local law

		HELL NO!!!  Thats the last thing

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked
		this.  Im truly sorry, maam.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

				MANAGER
		Im sure I wouldnt know, maam ...

				MARIETTA
		And jus when my babys out on some
		Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

				MARIETTA

		Santos...  Wheres J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS
		Shhhhhh...

		Thank you, gentlemen...  Ill look

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch

		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		hafta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnies again.

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Hell, its even worse than I 
		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

				JUANA
		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie

		FUCKIN HOT NOW, REGGIE.

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies 
face.

				JUANA

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted

		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA

		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers

Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

				LULA
		Oh God, Sailor.

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

				LULA
		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

				SAILOR
		I dont know, honey, but we gotta

		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Dont you say one word of this to
		my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes
		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL
			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  Whyd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

slumps down on the edge of the bed.

				LULA
		Im gonna stay here in this room, 
		Sailor.  I dont feel so good?  This
		heat makes me tired.

				SAILOR
		Okay, honey, Ill see you later.

125. EXT. REDS GARAGE - DAY

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair 
the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

				SAILOR
		You Red?

				RED
			(with a smile)
		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
		the drugstore thought you might have
		some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things aint real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,
			(nodding toward a half-naked
			man burrowed under an 83 Buick)
		is about to relocate in about a week
		to San Angelo.  I might could use a
		man when he does...  You good with
		engines?

				SAILOR
		I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they 
		used to call me Wrench when I was a
		kid.

				RED
		Well see how she goes then when
		Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		Hows it look?

				RED
		Reckon the heads cracked, like I
		thought.

				SPARKY
		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED
		Ill get you foreigners a beer.



				BUDDY
			(to Sailor)
		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookin for a 
		place to settle.  Were bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  Its the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby Just
		Like The Country Peru yet?

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a 
		half ago.

				BUDDY
		You will.  Hes the Mr. Fix-It at 
		the Iguana.  His truck broke down 
		here a couple of months ago.

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious
		prison tattoos.

				RED
		Everbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in em
		than others.

				REX
		That aint no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetin yall.  Preciate
		the beer.  Ill be seein yall
		soon.

				BUDDY
		Very soon.

				SPARKY
		One thing about bein in Big Tuna:

127. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about 
a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing.  Sailor sees this 
when he opens the door.  He steps across the large spot and finds Lula 
just waking up on the bed.

				LULA
		That you, Sail, honey?

				SAILOR
		The only one.

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

				LULA
		You find any work?

				SAILOR
		Maybe.  Met a guy named Red, owns a
		garage, could have some work in
		about a week.  Met a few hard luck
		boys whos stayin here.  Whats
		that smell?

				LULA
		I barfed.  Tried to make it to the

		it cleaned up.

				SAILOR
		You sick?

				LULA
		A little, I think...  Darlin?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		Come sit by me.

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

				LULA
		I dont know that this is the right

Sailor strokes Lulas head.

				SAILOR

Lula closes her eyes.

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY
		     (reading from paper)
		Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 
		killed when his car went off the road
		on State Highway 118, according to the
		Department of Public Safety.  Brenton
		and two passengers, William Reese and
		Susan Day, were thrown from the 
		automobile, reports said.

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckin Bob was
		so fuckin dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makin a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into
		a Dixie Cup?

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell em it floats.

				BUDDY
		Sparkys big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys
		the most excitin item to hit Big
		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		aint a young thing around dont 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		Im from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobbys right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youre off floatin in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  
		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin to go a peepin in a
		seafood store...  Good meetin you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after hes gone...

				LULA
		Somethin in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		Bobbys got a way...  Cant shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

				LULA
		Darlin, I still aint feelin so 
		well.  Im goin to bed.

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

				SAILOR
		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I dont think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you aint particularly pleased
		bein here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		Its okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothin personal, but I aint
		sure its okay by me.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.


				LULA
		Really, Sailor, it aint nothin

				SAILOR
		Love you, too.

				LULA
		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable

		Oh...  Look at this...  What do you

				BOBBY
		Say it...  Then Ill leave...  Whisper

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of

		Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson

				LULA
		Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey,

				SAILOR
		Lula, he mighta did, I dont know.
		But it dont matter now.  Lotta guys

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his

138. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is 
called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast.  Marietta 
stands at the top - watching.

				BOB RAY
		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I
		got somethin for ya.

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

				BOB RAY
		Shit, man...  Marietta says you been 
		tryin to fuck her in the toilets 
		for the past ten minutes...  You
		crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to 
		fuck your girls mama...  How do
		you think that cute little cunt Lula
		would feel about that?  Hey, take a
		look at this...
			(shows Sailor one thousand
			dollars in cash)
		Marietta just gave me this to kill
		you right now, and afterward she
		said Lula was mine to fuck all the
		way into next Sunday.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 
Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead 
at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers 
stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning 
with hate.

139. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - NIGHT

Sailor is dripping with sweat.  His teeth are clenched tight and his 
fists violently grip the sheets, as if any minute he could tear the bed 
apart.

								CUT TO:

140. INT. PERDITA DURANGOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams 
around the livingroom.

				PERDITA
		Nice of you to drop by.

				BOBBY
		Told ya I would.  You still riled?

				PERDITA
			(laughs)
		You still screwing sixteen-year-olds
		in the ass?

Bobby keeps circling.

				BOBBY
		Aint never had no girl pull a blade
		on me.

				PERDITA
		Wish Id fuckin cut you up good.

				BOBBY
		You heard from Reggie?

				PERDITA
		Juana called.  Theyre stayin 
		another week.

Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.

				BOBBY
		Stayin a few extra days in the big
		N.O., huh?  This you?

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

				PERDITA
		Yes.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, 
and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

				BOBBY
		Dont look like you.

Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perditas 
from behind.


				BOBBY
		The cobras waitin to strike, chica.

				PERDITA
		That guy Sailor came around this
		afternoon...  Asked me if there was
		a contract out on im.

				BOBBY
			(laughs out loud)
		No shit?!?!  You know him?

				PERDITA
		Used to.

				BOBBY
		Whatd you say?

				PERDITA
		No, of course.

Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands 
tails up in his hand.  He pockets it.

				BOBBY
		Thats right...  Could have a bad
		accident, though ... before ... 
		durin ... or after a hold-up...

				PERDITA
		Whats gonna happen when he sees me 
		drivin the car tomorrow?

				BOBBY
		Maybe hell get a little nervous,
		but who gives a shit?

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up 
and spits at him.

				BOBBY
			(grinning)
		I knew we could be friends again...

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

142. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it 
and they take off in a cloud of dust.

		Panty hose.  Work bettern stockins.

		Remember, soon as we get inside, you

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks 
crooked and distorted.

				BOBBY

		Come on!  Get that mask on!

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

				BOBBY
		Keep it revved, Chiquita.  We wont

shotgun and points it at the TWO OLD MEN behind the counter.

Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room.

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and 
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of 
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

				DEPUTY
		Waitin for somebody, Miss?

				PERDITA
		Mi esposo.  Hes in the feed store

				DEPUTY
		Youd best be careful of that cigarette,

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

				SAILOR
		BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!!

Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 
second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

her.

				MARIETTA
		Oh baby, I was beginnin to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

				MARIETTA
		Youre comin home, precious.  Santos
		gonna drive us to the San Antonio

				LULA
		Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
		I just cant leave him.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

				MARIETTA
		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamas been real worried bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,
		too?

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

				LULA
			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking
forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

				SAILOR
			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

				LULA

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

				PACE
		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA
		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,

				PACE
		Howll he know what we look like?
		He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA
		Damn it, child!  Now look what you
		made me do.

				PACE
		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

		Mamas just actin strange.

		Whyd you say that, Pace?

minutes past six.

				PACE

				LULA
		Why, honey?

Sailor smiles.

				SAILOR
		First pack of tailor-mades I had in

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR
		You must be my son.

				LULA
		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR
		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
		a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

				LULA

				PACE
		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR
		     (turning to Pace and

		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

				LULA
		Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant

				LULA
		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR
		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.

				LULA
		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats

				SAILOR
		He aint never known me, Lula, so

		Not seein each other for six years
		makes it next best to simple for us, too.

				LULA
		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

				LULA
		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR
		You been doin fine without me, peanut.

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR
		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR
		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR
		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I havent had any parental 
		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH
		Shes forgiven you of all these things
		...  You love her...  Dont be

				SAILOR
		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH
		If you are truly wild at heart, youll

		away from love...  Dont turn away
		from love.

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER
		You had enough, asshole?

		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR
		LULA!!!!

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 
Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not

		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and
		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone

		My deranged mamas hid the keys to

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethin like

		think somethin and then later think
		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is Gods own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole em from her beginnin in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokin when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.
		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR
		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin the old paint off our
		house without usin a mask...  But
		I dont know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the

		I knew this would happen.  Soon as

		Hes just got some kind of influence

		where it comes from.  You gotta find

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with

		that is - there aint much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 
		its leakin all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  Youd only be defendin 
		yourself, and with his record,

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill

		convince her to come back with me.
		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.
		And dont be gettin carried away.
		You dont want to be bringin Santos

				MARIETTA
		Youre just jealous of Santos cause

				JOHNNIE
		Darlin, you aint seein Santos

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryin about me and

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And fars I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
		to that involvin Lula.  Even there
		he was protectin her.  You oughta

		Ray Lemon they say was comin after

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon Id be
		startin to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddys?  And my mama
		never knew nothin about me and 
		him - thats for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moren
		a little.

				SAILOR
		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I cant hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how

		We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt

				LULA
		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess theres all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makin my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
		strange or different after.  And he

		Sailor, that ozone layer is

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR

		That aint never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womans laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethin like that...

		Have it your way...  But you want it.

		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA
		I want you to take care of Sailor, so
		he wont ever be able to bother my
		baby again.


				SANTOS
		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		Whats with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I dont 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and Im telling
		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a
		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on
		playin this stupid game?

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA
		I dont need to explain anymoren I
		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS
		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA
		All right...  I want you ... to ...
		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS
		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA
		Thats your business...  I dont care
		how.

				SANTOS
		Like an accident where maybe Lula
		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA
		NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS
		Well, like kill him with the atomic
		bomb?

				MARIETTA
		Santos...

				SANTOS
		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA
		Shoot him.

				SANTOS
		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA
		No.

				SANTOS
		Where?

				MARIETTA
		In the head.

				SANTOS
		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 
		gun...  Now Im beginning to get 
		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor
		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the
		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA
		No...  In the brains...  What little
		Im sure he has.

				SANTOS
		You want me to shoot Sailor in the
		brains with a gun.  

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Through the forehead?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Wrong!  Its much better to blow a

		right toward the bridge of the nose
		...  Lots and lots of irreparable
		damage.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under 
		control.

				SANTOS
		Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...
		Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that
		town.

				SANTOS
		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS
		You give me your permission to kill
		Johnnie Farragut.

				MARIETTA
			(whisper)
		Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

				SANTOS
		Youre not tellin me that youre 
		sweet on him?

				MARIETTA
		No...  But...

				SANTOS
		One day hes gonna find out what 
		were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and
		he could cause us a lot of trouble.

They stare at each other for a moment.

				SANTOS
		Im gonna take your silence as a 
		yes...

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  I cant...


				SANTOS
		Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I
		either take you or that pretty 
		daughter of yours to bed.

				MARIETTA
		You fucker, dont you ever touch 
		Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

				SANTOS
			(laughing)
		Put your shoulders back.

				MARIETTA
		What?

				SANTOS
		Put your shoulders back, I said.

Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of 
her.

				SANTOS
		You got nice tits.

				MARIETTA
		Someones gonna see us.

				SANTOS
			(smiling as he starts
			to feel her breasts)
		Thats just another part of the price
		to pay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  You kill that Sailor, 
		otherwise hes gonna turn my baby
		against me.

Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up 
towards his.

				SANTOS

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me its a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR
		(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)
		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR
		     (helping him up)
		Im sorry to do this to ya here 
		in front of a crowd, but I want ya
		to stand up and make a nice apology
		to my girl.

				IDIOT PUNK
			(to Lula)
		Im sorry.

				LULA
		Hell, you just rubbed up against 
		the wrong girl is all.

				SAILOR
		Thats good...  Now go get yourself
		a beer.
			(turning to the band)
		You fellas have alotta the same power
		Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band 
joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula.  The Speed Metal 
crowd is mesmerized.

CU of pink - the whole screen is filled with pink nylon.  Panning down,

favorite pink shortie nightgown.

				LULA
		Why didnt ya sing Love Me Tender?
		...  You told me that was your

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The 
Dating Game show.

				SAILOR
		Cause Im only gonna sing that song

Lula makes a face.  She lies down on the bed next to Sailor.

		You want to tell me what, if any,

Sailor grunts.

				LULA
		Whats that honey?

				SAILOR
		We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee,

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

				LULA
		Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some
		moments where all you been the last
		two years.

				SAILOR
		Twenty-three months, eighteen days is

Sailor and Lula are in bed.  Lula lays in Sailors arms.

				LULA
		Sailor?

		Wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow

				LULA
		Oh, you know exactly what I mean,

				SAILOR
		At Pee Dee, all you think about is 
		the future, you know?  Gettin out?
		And what youll do and what youll
		think about when youre on the 
		outside again.

				LULA
		I just think about things as they

				SAILOR
		It aint altogether terrible just to

		Lula, I done a few things in my life
		I aint too proud of, but Ill tell

Sailor and Lula are walking along the beach.  Lula takes off her shoes.

		M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i...  You can almost

		big N.O.

				SAILOR
		Lula...  I learned somethin interestin
		today on a science show I heard on the
		radio...  How leeches is comin back
		into style.

				LULA
		Say what?  Honestly, sugar, you can
		talk more shit sometimes?

She takes out a cigarette the length and width of a Dixon Ticonderoga 
No. 2 pencil and lights it.

				SAILOR
		Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?

				LULA
		Yeah, its a real problem for me, 
		Sailor, you know?  When I went in
		that drugstore by the restaurant in
		Biloxi?  I saw em by the register
		and the girl throw em in.  Im
		not big on resistin.  So what about
		a leech?

				SAILOR
		Heard on the radio how doctors is
		usin leeches again, just in old
		times.  You know, when even barbers
		used em?

				LULA
			(shuddering)
		I got one on me at Lake Lanier.  
		Lifeguard poured salt on it and it
		dropped off.  Felt awful.  He was a
		cute boy, though, so it was almost
		worth it.

Sailor laughs.

				SAILOR
		Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio
		said back in the 1920s a I-talian 
		doctor figured out that if, say, a
		fella got his nose cut off or bit
		off in, say, a barfight or somethin,
		theyd sew one of his forearms to his
		nose for a few weeks...  Then put
		leeches on it.

				SAILOR
			(nodding)
		How they used to do it.  Course they
		got more sophisticated ways now.
		Radio said the Chinese, I think it
		is, figured a better idea is by
		insertin a balloon in the forehead
		and lettin it hand down on the nose.

Lula shrieks.

				LULA
		Sailor Ripley!  You stop!  Youre
		makin this shit up and I aint
		gonna sit for it!

				SAILOR
		Honest, Lula.  I probly aint
		precisely got all the facts straight,

				LULA
		Honey, were goin to bed now and

Shes so cute Sailor just has to kiss her.

73. INT. THUNDERBIRD - SOUTHERN HIGHWAY - DAY

Sailor and Lula pass a sign that reads NEW ORLEANS - 26 MILES.  Sailor 
pulls off the road into a Gulf gas station mini-mart and stops the car 
next to a self-serve pump.  A sign on the top of it says PLEASE PAY 
INSIDE BEFORE FUELING.

				SAILOR
		Were about dry bones, sweetheart.
		We dont wanna have to push this

				LULA
		We sure dont, honey...

		Get me a Mounds?


74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN
		    (to Sailor and another guy 
		    also waiting to pay for gas)
		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished
		on my shoppin here.

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		Yall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more
		things.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		Id just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if its
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
send.

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my 
		way...
			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wants ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I aint got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope
		thats okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.


75. EXT. MINI MART/THUNDERBIRD - DAY

Sailor goes back to the car.

				LULA
		That took long enough.  You forget
		my Mounds?

Sailor tosses her the candy bar.

				SAILOR
		I really do think the country done
		changed just a little while I was
		away, peanut.

Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut.

				LULA
			(as she chews)
		You got to keep an eye on it.  Thats
		sure.

Sailor starts pumping gas.

78. INT. THE ROUND ROOM RESTAURANT - NEW ORLEANS - DAY

At a table near the window, Johnnie takes a man-sized pull off his Dixie 
beer in between bites of an oyster sandwich.  A large, chocolate-colored 
man in his early thirties, REGINALD SAN PEDRO SULA, and a smaller white 
man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.

				REGGIE
		Do you mind if we share this table?
		...  The others, they are occupied.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he 
looks the men over quickly.

				JOHNNIE
			(cautiously)
		Alright...  By all means.  Make 
		yourselves at home.

				DROP SHADOW
			(as he sits down)
		Muchas gracias.

				REGGIE
		My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula.
		But please do call me Reggie.  This
		is my friend, who we call Drop
		Shadow.  He is always with me.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE
		You are from New Orleans, Senor 
		Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,
		North Carolina.  Here on business.

Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

				REGGIE
		Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

				JOHNNIE
		Only that its supposed to be a 
		pretty poor sight since the hurricane
		came through last year.

				REGGIE
		Yes, thats so.  But there is not 
		much to destroy.

				DROP SHADOW
		No big buildings like in New Orleans.

				JOHNNIE
		Whattaya do there?

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Oh, many things...

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance
		shop.

				REGGIE
		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

				JOHNNIE
		In what capacity?

				REGGIE
		In many capacities.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 
		Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 
a card to Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
			(reading aloud)
		General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
		Telefono 666.

				REGGIE
		He is my sponsor.  The General is
		the head of the secret police of
		Honduras.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his
		operatives.

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

				REGGIE
		That is my permiso.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and
		only in my own country.
			(laughs)

				JOHNNIE
		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to
		carry a .45.

				REGGIE
		United States Marine issue, before
		they made the unfortunate switch to
		the less dependable nine millimeters.
		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
		dont mind my askin.

				REGGIE
		Certainly not.  We are here only
		briefly, in fact, until this evening,
		when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit
		a friend of mine who is an agent for
		the CIA.

				DROP SHADOW
		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula
		and me bass fishing.

				REGGIE
		We are in the same businesses and
		also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

				JOHNNIE
			(extending his hand)
		Its been a real pleasure.  I wish
		you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in 
		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
		visit us.  The Hondurans are great
		friends of the American people.  But
		I have a joke for you before I go.
		If a liberal, a socialist, and a 
		communist all jumped off the roof of
		the Empire State Building at the 
		same time, which one of them would
		hit the ground first?

				JOHNNIE
		I couldnt say, which one?

Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line.

				DROP SHADOW
			(grinning)
		Who cares?

		Dont know that I have...  Should I

				GEORGE
		Was in all the papers three years ago.
		Im seventy-six, was only seventy-
		three then.  Had a business in
		Buffalo, New York, called Rats With
		Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone
		who wanted em killed.

				LULA
		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination
		business?

				GEORGE
		No, maam.  I was a housepainter, 
		in the union forty-one years.  Im
		retired now, livin with my sister, 
		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five
		years ago, married an oil man named
		Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  Hes dead now,
		so its just me and Ida.  I sold my
		house and moved down after the city
		of Buffalo put me out of business.
		Hell, RWW was doin them a service,
		and they charged me with endangerin
		the public.

				LULA
		Whats wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?

		Earls roof was a favorite spot for

				SAILOR
		If your neighbors didnt mind,

				GEORGE
		Woman drivin down the street spotted

		and arrested me.  Thought I was a
		sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that
		one.  Cops didnt understand about
		the pigeons, the damage they do to
		personal property.  I used to complain
		to the city but they never lifted
		a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,
		but I was afraid somebodys cat 
		would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats
		myself.  So I used the .22 because
		it didnt make much noise and the
		ammo was cheap.

				SAILOR
		What happened on the charges?

				GEORGE
		Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred
		dollar fine and ordered to desist.
		Pigeons carry diseases and muss up

Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.

				GEORGE
		Its a serious situation.  Not like

carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

				ROACH
		Thanks a lot.  I been standin out
		there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!
		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchin on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My names Sailor, and this heres
		Lula.  Whats yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		Aint laughin, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guys crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I aint never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, 
		ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im
		gonna feed these boys good so theyll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  Youd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you dont mind my sayin so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookin after yourself, startin with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You dont feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youre thinkin that I got
		moren some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippin hunk
		of awful-smellin meat out of his
		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them 
		poor diseased puppies!

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		Just part of life on the road, peanut.

				LULA
		Do me a favor, Sailor?  Dont pick up
		no more hitchers, okay?

		You better get a move on, Johnnie,

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more

		I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		ones intelligence...  Others may use

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE
		Hasta siempre.

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that
		copper wire was invented in Scotland?

				JOHNNIE
		Hows that?

				DROP SHADOW
		Two Scotsmen were fighting over a

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are

Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and 
pulls the car over.

Two skinny, pimply-faced guys, BUCK and BILLY, wearing dirty coveralls 
walk over to them.

				BUCK

				BILLY
		Theres a boogie joint just about a

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		Thats a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me it represents a symbol of my 
		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come
		in?  The white woman sittin by 
		herself?

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she aint talked to nobody 
		and aint nobody spoke to her that
		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we bein strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we dont
		want to make nothin of nothin.

				LULA
		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face aint
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin
		botherin you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkin about her.
		Shes probly worried to death by now.

				SAILOR
		Moren likely.

				LULA
		I want to call her and tell her
		Im okay.  That were okay.

				SAILOR
		I aint so sure its a great idea,
		but thats up to you.  Just dont tell

				LULA
			(to Bartender)
		Pardon me?  Yall got a phone here 
		I can use?

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		Cant you read?

She kisses him on the nose and walks back through a dark little door to

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

								CUT TO:

115. INT. GALATOIRES RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They go downstairs together.  At the bottom of the stairs, Reggie and 
Drop Shadow catch sight of Johnnie who is sitting in the back of the 
restaurant having dinner with Marietta.  When Johnnie sees the two of 
them he waves, but at the same time gets a chill up his spine.

				MARIETTA
		What is it, Johnnie?

				JOHNNIE
		Just some guys I met here...  I 
		keep seein em...
			(looks back at Marietta)
		Now tell me...

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before 
turning back to Johnnie.  She also feels the fear.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie, I cant tell you, honey.  Is
		there anyway we can get on the road
		tonight?  Weve got to find them kids.

				JOHNNIE
		Somethin was upsettin you bad last
		night, and you wanted to tell me
		and I figured you wanted to tell me
		sos I could help...

				MARIETTA
		I did, honey, but that was last 
		night...  Lets just find those two
		kids before its too late.

				JOHNNIE
		Honey, I have to ask you this...
		Is Santos involved in any of this?

				MARIETTA
		Hell no, baby...  I wouldnta done
		that without tellin you.

				JOHNNIE
		That bastard Pucinski...

				MARIETTA
		Who?...  Uncle Pooch?...

				JOHNNIE
		Yeah...  The one that introduced 
		Santos to you and Clyde.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie...  Thats the past...  We
		gotta get on to our future, sugar!

				JOHNNIE
			(smiles)
		All I have to do is grab my suitcase,
		and Im ready.  Youre lucky cause
		I happen to love night drivin.

				MARIETTA
		Lets head for Texas and see if we
		can pick up the trail.

				JOHNNIE
		Did I tell ya its great to see ya

				MARIETTA
		This bout the fifth time?

Johnnie and Marietta climb together to the second floor and Johnnie 
takes Marietta to her room.

				MARIETTA
		    (as she enters her room)
		Ill pack my things and meet you
		downstairs.

				JOHNNIE
		And to think what coulda happened
		in that king-sized bed tonight...

				MARIETTA
			(pinching his cheek)
		You wont of missed much.

				JOHNNIE

116A. MAISON VIOLETTE - JOHNNIES ROOM - NIGHT

Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room.  He opens the door and steps 
inside.  WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe 
and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls 
him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up.  The
dark figure follows out the window.

DISSOLVE TO:


117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-
sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

				MANAGER
		Im afraid his car is gone, Mrs.
		Fortune.

				MARIETTA
		I dont understand this...  I dont
		understand this one bit.  He was 
		supposed to meet me right her in 
		this lobby.  Somethin bad has 
		happened - I jus know it.

				MANAGER
		Perhaps we should call a local law
		enforcement officer.

				MARIETTA
		HELL NO!!!  Thats the last thing 
		we need...  A buncha cops runnin
		around.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked
		this.  Im truly sorry, maam.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

				MANAGER
		Im sure I wouldnt know, maam ...
		and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm?

				MARIETTA
		And jus when my babys out on some
		Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(horrified whisper)
		Santos...  Wheres J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS
		Shhhhhh...
			(to the manager and desk clerk)
		Thank you, gentlemen...  Ill look
		after her now...

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 
through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  Whats happenin here?

				SANTOS
		Hey...  Stop the nervous cry-baby
		routine...  Youre my girl now...
		Santos is gonna wipe away those tears
		and make you happy...  Come on, lets
		get outta here.

				MARIETTA
		Where we goin?

				SANTOS
		Got word the kids are moving through

Light comes from one small dirty window.

								CUT TO:

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch
		close to know when we do it to ya...
		Yall count when I touch the bottle -
		HO!!...
			(she slaps Johnnie hard

		There I slap that mutha fucka face -
		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		hafta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet 
		second Mr. Killer...  Does he fish
		or dont he?

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnies again.

				JUANA
		Now Johnnie...  We want to feel the
		feelin...  Feel the feelin...  We
		be gettin up close to you, mutha

		I cant stop her, Johnnie...  She
		gets me too hot doin this...  Im
		gonna be right here, but Im gonna
		stand right behind ya with this big
		ol gun here...

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Hell, its even worse than I 
		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

				JUANA
		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie
		bfore I fuck ya right now...
		FUCKIN HOT NOW, REGGIE.
		    (she opens her mouth with 
		     her tongue sticking out)
		FUCKIN HOT!

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies 
face.

				JUANA
		You think you gonna live through
		this night?...  YOU WRONG...  I
		SMELL YO SHIT NOW, JOHNNIE.  GIVE
		US ONE MO KISS, REGGIE.  OH FUCK 
		ME!!!  WE TOUCH BOTTLES NOW - FO

Reggie goes back behind Johnnie quick.

				JUANA
		I go out now...  I toucha one bottle...
		Reggie...  I toucha two bottle...
		I come back, I touch Johnnie...  AHHHHH

		FUCKIN PUSSY - GO OUT NOW...  NOW I GO
		ROUND AND ROUND YOU AHHHH - GO OUT AND
		TOUCH A NUMBER ONE BOTTLE - WAIT NOW!!!
		...  REGGIE...  YOU SHOW NOW-

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted 
		itd be bout the last thing you ever
		saw in this life.

				JOHNNIE
		     (recognizing cufflink)
  Oh God...  OH GOD...  Santos...  
		Oh God Marietta ... are you in on

				JUANA
		I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A
		SECOND BOTTLE BFORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE
		- DO I?  DO I???.........
		    (very quietly and breathy)
		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

				JUANA
			(counting fast)
		One ... two ... three ... four ...
		five ... GETTIN TOO FUCKIN HOT, 
		REGGIE...  FEELIN MYSEF ... six

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA
		Nine...
		   (she moves out of the way)
		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 
race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead, 
bloodied head.

				JUANA

		You know, Lula, I never told you

				LULA
		I just figured you was out bein

				SAILOR
		Not exactly, sugar...  One reason

				LULA
		Youre scarin me, baby.

				SAILOR
		Well, theres a good side as well as
		a bad side to it...  The good side
		is I knew your daddy, and I thought
		Clyde was a good ol guy...

				LULA
		You knew my daddy?

				SAILOR
		Yes I did...  I sure did...  The bad
		side of it is I did some drivin

				LULA
		Oh shit...

				SAILOR
		I quit workin for im, but just
		before I did, I ended up one night at 
		a house...  I dont know what it is
		they all think I saw that night, but
		I was just sittin out in the car

				LULA
		God, Sailor...  Thats the night my

				SAILOR
		I know, sugar...  But while the place
		was burnin...  Before Santos came
		out - I pitched some rocks at the 
		second floor windows case anyone was
		upstairs sleepin...  Afterwards...
		When I met you, I always liked to

				LULA
		Thats some big secret you been

Lula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8.

				SAILOR
		Lula, you there?

				LULA
		Yeah, Im here.

				SAILOR

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 
smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers 
bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 
heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

				LULA

		So Sailor, our histories have been

				SAILOR
		They have, sugar.

				LULA
		I take that as a sign that we were

				SAILOR
		Its a comfortin idea.

				LULA
		Well, were really out in the middle

				SAILOR
		Theres worse places, honey.

				LULA
		If you say so.

				SAILOR
		Trust me on it.

		I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I 
		aint never trusted nobody before.

				SAILOR
			(after a moment)
		Well be alright, peanut, long as 
		weve got room to move.

				LULA
		   (looking into the highway)
		Whats that?

				SAILOR
		I dont know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

				LULA
		Oh God, Sailor.


				SAILOR
		One bad car accident...

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

				LULA
		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

				SAILOR
		I dont know, honey, but we gotta 
		help that girl - get her to a town and
		hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

				GIRL
			(completely gone in shock)
		Ive got about five hundred dollars 
		in my wallet and I cant find it...
		My mothers going to kill me.  Its 
		got all my cards in it...  It was 
		in my pocket...  Now my pockets gone.
		MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME.

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

				SAILOR
		Lets get ahold a her quick.

				LULA
		You think shes gonna make it?

				SAILOR
		Dont know, but shes gonna bleed
		all over our car, Ill tell ya that...
		           (to Girl)
		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta
		come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn
		sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Dont you say one word of this to
		my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes
		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL
			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  Whyd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

				RED
			(with a smile)
		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
		the drugstore thought you might have

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things aint real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,
			(nodding toward a half-naked
			man burrowed under an 83 Buick)
		is about to relocate in about a week

				SAILOR
		I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they

				RED
		Well see how she goes then when
		Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		Hows it look?

				RED
		Reckon the heads cracked, like I

				SPARKY
		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED
		Ill get you foreigners a beer.



				BUDDY

		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookin for a 
		place to settle.  Were bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  Its the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby Just
		Like The Country Peru yet?

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a

				BUDDY
		You will.  Hes the Mr. Fix-It at

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious
		prison tattoos.

				RED
		Everbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in em

				REX
		That aint no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetin yall.  Preciate
		the beer.  Ill be seein yall

				LULA

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

				LULA
		You find any work?

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY
		     (reading from paper)
		Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 
		killed when his car went off the road
		on State Highway 118, according to the
		Department of Public Safety.  Brenton
		and two passengers, William Reese and
		Susan Day, were thrown from the 
		automobile, reports said.

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckin Bob was
		so fuckin dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makin a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into
		a Dixie Cup?

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell em it floats.

				BUDDY
		Sparkys big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys
		the most excitin item to hit Big
		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		aint a young thing around dont 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		Im from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobbys right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youre off floatin in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  
		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin to go a peepin in a
		seafood store...  Good meetin you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after hes gone...

				LULA
		Somethin in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		Bobbys got a way...  Cant shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

				LULA
		Darlin, I still aint feelin so 
		well.  Im goin to bed.

				SAILOR
		Ill come along.

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

		Man, that barf smell dont fade fast.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

				SAILOR
		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I dont think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you aint particularly pleased
		bein here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down
		cause I cant say it.

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		Its okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothin personal, but I aint
		sure its okay by me.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.


				LULA
		Really, Sailor, it aint nothin 
		against you.  I love you.

				SAILOR
		Love you, too.

				LULA
		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable
		about the way some things is goin,
		and this dont help soothe me.

				BOBBY
		Hey, pretty woman...  Sailor here?

				LULA
		No, hes out changin the oil in

				BOBBY
		Man, I gotta take a piss bad...  Can

Sailor pulls the T-Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door.  
Flies are buzzing all around.  PERDITA DURANGO comes forward out of the 
darkness inside.

				PERDITA
			(recognizing him)
		Oh...  Look at this...  What do you

				SAILOR
		Just passin through on my way to

				PERDITA
		Heard you was goin out with that

				SAILOR
		You heard right.

				PERDITA
		You really are one dumb asshole.

				SAILOR
		Life is unpredictable.

				PERDITA
		Does that girlfriend of yours know

		Does she know her own daddy was one

Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair.

				BOBBY
		Hey...  Im sorry...  I dont think

With all the strength she can muster, Lula slaps Bobby across the face.

Bobby grabs on to her hard.

Bobby moves in very close to her - Lulas trembling.  Bobby puts his 
hand on her neck and moves it up and down behind her ear.

				BOBBY
		Say it...  Then Ill leave...  Whisper

		Whisper fuck me...

His hand moves down over her breasts - down across her stomach - and 
down.  Lulas left hand opens and spreads wide.

		Whisper...

				LULA

		Fuck me.

Sailor throws some stuff in the trunk and closes the lid.

Bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Q-7, three times.  Pee Wee Kings
		Waltz of Regret, my favorite tune.

Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes 
around Sailors head.  His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind 
the bar.

				BOBBY

				SAILOR
		Whats that?

				BOBBY
		Feed store keeps up to five K in

Sailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes.

				SAILOR
		No...  I dont think so, man.

				BOBBY
		Be easy, Sailor.  Theres two employees.
		I take one in the back to open the

		Well...  I mean like Lula bein in

Bobby grins, showing those three brown teeth.

		Couple grand or mored give you two

136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of 
the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

				BOBBY
		Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off,
		Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol
		grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape.
		Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson
		.32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
		Thesell do er...  Loosen up that

Bobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

				BOBBY
		How much money you have between the

				SAILOR
		Forty bucks...

Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches.

				SAILOR

				BOBBY
		Hey...  I never said you was a pussy...
		Always figured you had the big ol

Sailor gets into bed.

				SAILOR
		You shouldnt be smokin if youre

Lula sticks a More between her lips and lights it.  She takes a deep 
drag, blows out the smoke, and stares at Sailor.

				SAILOR
		What could I be up to, Lula?

				LULA
		Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey,

				SAILOR
		Lula, I got to get some sleep.

				SAILOR
		What?

				LULA
		Was a massacre.  Soldiers there

		Peru probly killed the most.

				SAILOR
		Lula, he mighta did, I dont know.
		But it dont matter now.  Lotta guys

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

				LULA
		I sure enjoy smokin, Sailor.  I

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his

Lula turns over, away from Sailor.

				BOB RAY
		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

				BOB RAY
		Shit, man...  Marietta says you been

		Marietta just gave me this to kill

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 
Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

				PERDITA
		Yes.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana,

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has 
been waiting in the hot sun.  Bobby opens the door.

				BOBBY
		Jump in back.

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it 
and they take off in a cloud of dust.

		Panty hose.  Work bettern stockins.

		Remember, soon as we get inside, you

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks 
crooked and distorted.

				BOBBY
		     (frightening whisper)
		Come on!  Get that mask on!

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

				BOBBY
		Keep it revved, Chiquita.  We wont

shotgun and points it at the TWO OLD MEN behind the counter.

Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room.

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and 
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of 
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

				DEPUTY
		Waitin for somebody, Miss?

				PERDITA

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

				SAILOR
		BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!!

Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 
second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County

sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses 
her.

				MARIETTA
		Oh baby, I was beginnin to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

				MARIETTA
		Youre comin home, precious.  Santos
		gonna drive us to the San Antonio

				LULA
		Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
		I just cant leave him.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

				MARIETTA
		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamas been real worried bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,
		too?

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

				LULA
			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking
forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

				SAILOR
			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

				LULA
		Im goin, mama.  No way I cant go.

				MARIETTA
		You aint takin Pace, though.

				LULA
		Course I am, mama.

		Six.

				MARIETTA
		Got any plans?

				LULA
		Figure well go have supper someplace.
		Maybe get some barbecue out by

		Havana Browns Pig Pickin.

				MARIETTA
		Well, you be careful with that boy,

				LULA
		Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.

				MARIETTA
		Dont mean him.  Its Pace concerns me.

				LULA
		Really, mama, I gotta go.

				MARIETTA
		What if I asked you not to?

				LULA
		Wouldnt make any difference.

				MARIETTA
		What if I told you not to?

				LULA
			(forcefully)
		Mama ... if you get in the way of

Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother - 
draining it.

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

				PACE
		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA
		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,
		please.  This aint the easiest day
		in a long time.  And what do you
		mean how are we gonna know what your
		daddy looks like?  You seen his photo.


				PACE
		Howll he know what we look like?
		He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA
		Damn it, child!  Now look what you
		made me do.

				PACE
		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

				LULA
		Nothin, honey.

		Mamas just actin strange.

				PACE
		You aint actin, mama.

		Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, aint you

				PACE

		Whyd you say that, Pace?

				PACE
		Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama

				LULA
		And?

				PACE
		Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

				LULA
		Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never

Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk 
toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten 
minutes past six.

				PACE
		Im scared, mama.

				LULA
		Why, honey?

				PACE
		Case daddy dont like me.  What if

Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an

				LULA
		Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

				SAILOR
		First pack of tailor-mades I had in

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR
		You must be my son.

				LULA
		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR
		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
		a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

				LULA
		You hungry?  Pace and I aint had
		dinner yet.

		Lead the way.

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping

off the engine and gets out of the car.

				PACE
		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR
		     (turning to Pace and 
			patting his head)
		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

				LULA
		Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant 
		help it.  Give me a minute and Ill
		quit.

				SAILOR
		Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint
		no good.

				LULA
		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR
		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.
		Ill walk back to the depot.

				LULA
		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats 
		your son in there.

				SAILOR
		He aint never known me, Lula, so 
		there aint much for him to forget.
		Not seein each other for six years
		makes it next best to simple for us, too.

				LULA
		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

				LULA
		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

				SAILOR
			(to Pace)
		Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin 
		dont feel right to you, remember what
		Pancho said to The Cisco Kid...  
		Lets went, before we are dancing at
		the end of a rope, without music.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR
		You been doin fine without me, peanut. 
		There aint no need to make life 
		toughern it has to be.

He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR
		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR
		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR
		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I havent had any parental 
		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH
		Shes forgiven you of all these things
		...  You love her...  Dont be
		afraid, Sailor.

				SAILOR
		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH
		If you are truly wild at heart, youll
		fight for your dreams...  Dont turn
		away from love, Sailor...  Dont turn
		away from love...  Dont turn away
		from love.

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER
		You had enough, asshole?

				SAILOR
		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize
		to you gentlemen for referring to 
		you as homosexuals.  I also want to

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR
		LULA!!!!

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 
Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.
